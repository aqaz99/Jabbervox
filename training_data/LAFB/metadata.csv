LAFB-1||party of Ku Klux Klan Riders Gallop to our home in Omaha Nebraska
LAFB-2||the one night surrounding the house brandishing their shotguns and rifles they shouted for my father to come out
LAFB-3||my mother went to the front door and opened it standing where they could see her pregnant condition she told them that she was alone with her three small children and that my father was away preaching in Milwaukee
LAFB-5||my father the Reverend Earl little was a Baptist Minister a dedicated organizing for Marcus Aurelius garbes unia Universal negro Improvement Association
LAFB-6||with the help of such disciples as my father gobbi from his headquarters in New York City Harlem was Raising
LAFB-7||Banner of black race Purity and exhorting the Negro masses to return to their ancestral African Homeland a cause which it made Garvey the most controversial black man on Earth
LAFB-8||still shouting threats the klansman finally spurred their horses and galloped around the house shattering every window pane with their gun butts
LAFB-9||then they rode off into the night their torches flaring as suddenly as they had come
LAFB-10||my father was in Rage when he returned he decided to wait until I was born which would be soon and then the family would move
LAFB-11||I am not sure why he made this decision for he was not a frightened negro as most than were and many still are today
LAFB-12||my father was a big 6 ft for very black man
LAFB-13||he had only one eye how he lost the other one I have never known
LAFB-14||he was from Reynolds Georgia where he had left school after third or maybe fourth grade
LAFB-15||he believed as did Marcus Garvey the freedom Independence and self-respect could never be achieved by the Negro in America and that therefore the Negro should leave America to the white man and returned to his African land of origin
LAFB-16||among the reasons my father had decided to risk and dedicate his life to help disseminate this philosophy among his people
LAFB-17||was that he had seen four of his six brothers died by violence three of them killed by white men including one by lynching
LAFB-18||what my father could not know then was that of the remaining three including himself only one my Uncle Jim would die in bed of natural causes
LAFB-19||Northern white police were later to shoot my uncle Oscar and my father was finally himself to die by the white man's hands
LAFB-20||it is always been my belief that I too will die by violence I have done all that I can to be prepared
LAFB-21||I was my father's seventh child he had three children by a previous marriage Ella Earl and Mary who lived in Boston
LAFB-22||he had met and married my mother in Philadelphia where their first child my oldest full brother Wilfred was born
LAFB-23||they moved from Philadelphia to Omaha where Hilda and Filbert were born
LAFB-24||I was next in line my mother was 28 when I was born on May 19th 1925 in an Omaha Hospital
LAFB-25||then we move to Milwaukee where Reginald was born
LAFB-26||from infancy he had a kind of hernia condition which was to handicapped him physically for the rest of his life
LAFB-27||Louise little my mother was born in Grenada in the British West Indies look like a white woman
LAFB-28||her father was white she had straight black hair and her accent did not sound like a Negroes
LAFB-29||of this white father of hers I know nothing except her Shame about it
LAFB-30||I remember hearing her say she was glad that she had
LAFB-31||Racine him it wasn't course because of him I got my reddish-brown marigny color of skin and my hair the same color
LAFB-32||I was the lightest child in our family out in the world later on in Boston and New York I was among the millions of negroes who were insane enough to feel that it was some kind of status symbol to be like complexion the one that wasn't actually fortunate to be born this
LAFB-33||but still later I learned to hate every drop of that white rapist blood that is in me
LAFB-34||our family stayed only briefly in Milwaukee for my father wanted to find a place where he can raise our own food and crab to build a business
LAFB-35||the teaching of Marcus Garvey stress becoming independent of the white man
LAFB-36||we went next for some reason to Lansing Michigan
LAFB-37||my father bought a house and soon as have been his pattern he was doing freelance Christian preaching in local negro Baptist churches and during the week he was roaming about spreading word of Marcus Garvey
LAFB-38||it began to Layaway savings for the store he had always wanted to own when as always some stupid local Uncle Tom Negroes began to funnel stories about his revolutionary beliefs to the local white people
LAFB-39||this time to get out of town threats came from a local hate society called the black Legion
LAFB-40||they wore black robes instead of white soon nearly everywhere my father went black Legion ears were revealing him is an uppity Niger for wanting to own a store for living outside the Lansing negro district for spreading unrest and dissension among the good niggars
LAFB-41||as an Omaha my mother was pregnant again this time with my youngest sister
LAFB-42||shortly after Yvonne was born came the Nightmare Night in 1929 my earliest vivid memory
LAFB-43||I remember being suddenly snatched awakened to a frightening confusion of pistol shots and shouting and smoke and Flames my father had shouted and Shaw
LAFB-44||at the two white men who had set the fire and we're running away
LAFB-45||our home was burning down around us we were lunging and bumping and tumbling all over each other trying to escape
LAFB-46||my mother with the baby in her arms just made it into the yard before the house crashed in showering Sparks
LAFB-47||I remember we were outside in the night in our underwear crying and yelling our heads off the white police and fireman came and stood around us watching as the house burned to the ground
LAFB-48||my father prevailed on some friends to close and houses temporarily
LAFB-49||then he moved us into another house on the outskirts of East Lansing
LAFB-50||in those days Negroes weren't allowed after dark in East Lansing proper
LAFB-51||that's where Michigan State University is located
LAFB-52||I related all of this to an audience of students when I spoke there in January 1963 and had the first reunions in a long time with my younger
LAFB-53||the Robert who was there doing postgraduate studies in psychology
LAFB-54||I told them how East Lansing harassed us so much that we had to move again this time to miles out of town into the country
LAFB-55||this is where my father built for us with his own hands a four-room house
LAFB-56||this is where I really begin to remember things this home where I started to grow up
LAFB-58||the pistol they were looking for which they never found and for which they wouldn't issue a permit with sewed up inside a pillow
LAFB-59||my father's 22 rifle and a shotgun though were right out in the open everyone had them for hunting birds and rabbits and other game
LAFB-60||after that my memories are of the friction between my father and mother
LAFB-61||they seem to be nearly always at odds sometimes my father would beat her
LAFB-62||it might have had something to do with the fact that my mother had a pretty good education
LAFB-63||where she got it I don't know but an educated woman I suppose can't resist the temptation to correct an uneducated man
LAFB-64||every now and then when she put those smooth words on him he would grab her
LAFB-65||my father was also belligerent toward all of the children except me
LAFB-66||the older ones he would be almost savagely if they broke any of his rules and he had so many rules it was hard to know them all
LAFB-67||nearly all my whippings came from my mother I thought a lot about why
LAFB-68||I actually believe that is anti-white as my father was he was subconsciously so Afflicted with the white man's brainwashing of negroes that he inclined to favor the light ones and I was his lightest job
LAFB-69||most negro parents in those days would almost instinctively treat any lighter children better than they did the darker ones
LAFB-70||it came directly from the slavery tradition that the mulatto because he was visibly nearer to White was there for better
LAFB-71||my two other images of my father were both outside the home one was his role as a Baptist preacher
LAFB-72||he never Pastor than any regular church of his own he was always a visiting preacher
LAFB-73||I remember especially his favorite sermon
LAFB-74||that little black train is a coming and you better get all your business right
LAFB-75||I guess this also fit his association with the back to Africa movement with Marcus garvey's Black Train Homewood
LAFB-76||my brother filbert the one just older than me love to church but it confused and amazed me I would sit goggle-eyed at my father jumping and shouting as he preached with the congregation jumping and shouting behind him this souls and bye
LAFB-78||I had very little respect for most people who represented religion
LAFB-79||it was in his role as a preacher that my father had most contact with the Negroes of Lansing believe me when I tell you that those Negroes were in bad shape then they are still in bad shape though in a different way
LAFB-80||by that I mean I don't know what town do the higher percentage of complacent misguided so-called middle-class Negroes the typical status symbol oriented integration seeking type negro
LAFB-81||just recently I was standing in the lobby at the United Nations talkin with an African Ambassador and his wife when a negro came up to me and said you know me
LAFB-82||I was a little embarrassed because I thought he was someone else
LAFB-84||back when I was growing up the successful lanzini grows with such as waiters and bootblacks
LAFB-85||to be a janitor at some downtown store was to be highly respected
LAFB-86||the real elite the big shots the voices of the race with the waiters at the Lansing Country Club and the shoeshine boys at the state capitol
LAFB-87||the only Negroes really had any money with the ones in the numbers record or who ran the gambling houses or who in some other way live parasitically off the poorest ones who were the masses
LAFB-88||no Negroes were hired then by Landings big Oldsmobile plant or the real plant do you remember the Rio it was
LAFB-89||Orchard in Lansing and re old the man after whom it was named also lived in Lansing when the war came along they hired some negro janitors
LAFB-90||the bulk of the Negroes were either on welfare or WPA or they starved
LAFB-91||the day was to come when our family was so poor that we would eat the whole out of a donut
LAFB-92||but at that time we will much better off than most Town Negroes
LAFB-93||the reason was that we raised much of our own food out there in the country where we were
LAFB-94||we were much better off than the town Negroes who would shout as my father preached for the pie-in-the-sky and their heaven in the Hereafter while the white man had his here on Earth
LAFB-95||I knew that the collections my father God for his preaching were mainly what fed enclosed us and he also did other odd jobs but still the image of him that made me proudest was his crusading and Millington
LAFB-96||campaigning with the words of Marcus Garvey
LAFB-97||as young as I was then I knew from what I overheard that my father was saying something that made him a tough man
LAFB-98||I remember an old lady grinning and saying to my father you're scaring these white folks to death
LAFB-99||one of the reasons I've always felt that my father favored me was that to the best of my remembrance
LAFB-100||it was only me that he sometimes took with him to the Garvey unia meetings which he held quietly in different people's homes
LAFB-101||there were never more than a few people at any one time 20 at most but that was a lot packed into someone's living room
LAFB-102||I noticed how differently they all acted although sometimes they were the same people who jumped and shouted in church
LAFB-103||but in these meetings both day and my father were more intense more intelligent and down-to-earth it made me feel the same way
LAFB-104||I can remember hearing of Adam driven out of the go
LAFB-105||into the caves of Europe Africa for the Africans Ethiopians awake
LAFB-107||I remember seeing the Big Shiny photographs of Marcus Garvey that were passed from hand to hand
LAFB-108||my father had a big envelope of them that he always took to these meetings
LAFB-109||the picture showed what seemed to me millions of negroes thronged in parade behind Garvey riding in a fine car a big black man dressed in a dazzling uniform with gold braid on it
LAFB-110||and he was wearing a thrilling hat with tall plumes
LAFB-111||I remember hearing that he had black follow was not only in the
LAFB-112||nited States but all around the world and I remember how the meetings always closed with my father saying several times and the people chatting after him up you might he race you can accomplish what you will
LAFB-113||I've never understood why after hearing is much as I did at these kinds of things I somehow never thought then of the black people in Africa
LAFB-114||my image of Africa at that time was of naked Savages cannibals monkeys and tigers and steaming jungles
LAFB-115||my father would drive his old black touring car sometimes taking me to meeting places all around the Lansing area
LAFB-116||I remember one daytime meeting most were at night in the town of Owosso 40 miles from Lansing which the Negroes called White City
LAFB-117||Owasso greatest claim to fame is that it is the hometown of Thomas E Dewey
LAFB-118||as in East Lansing no Negroes were allowed on the streets there after doc hence
LAFB-120||Mister lion to be the famous football star at Mason High School and was highly thought of in Mason and consequently he now worked around that town in menial jobs
LAFB-121||my mother at this time seem to be always working cooking washing ironing cleaning and fussing over us eight children and she was usually either arguing with or not speaking to my father
LAFB-123||I've said that my mother was the one who whipped me at least she did whenever she wasn't ashamed to let the neighbors think she was killing me
LAFB-124||but even if she acted as though she was about to raise her hand to me I would open my mouth and let the world know about
LAFB-125||if anybody was passing by out on the road she would either change your mind or just give me a few licks
LAFB-126||thinking about it now I feel definitely that just as my father favored me for being lighter than the other children my mother gave me more hell for the same reason
LAFB-127||she was very light herself but she favored the ones who would darker Wilfred I know was particularly her angel
LAFB-128||I remember that she would tell me to get out of the house and let the sun shine on you so you can get some color
LAFB-129||she went out of her way to never let me become Afflicted with a sense of color superiority
LAFB-130||I am sure that you treated me this way partly because of how she came to be light herself
LAFB-131||I learned early the crying out in protest could accomplish things
LAFB-132||my older brothers and sisters had started to school when sometimes they would come in and ask for a Buttered Biscuit of something in my mother and patiently would tell them no
LAFB-133||but I would cry out and make a fuss until I got what I want
LAFB-135||not only did we have our big Garden but we raised chickens
LAFB-136||my father would buy some baby chicks and my mother would raise them
LAFB-137||we all loved chicken that was one dish there was no argument with my father about
LAFB-138||one thing in particular that I remember made me feel grateful toward my mother was at one day I went and asked her for my own garden and she did let me have my own there
LAFB-139||W I loved it and took care of it well
LAFB-141||at 5 I to began to go to school
LAFB-142||leaving home in the morning along with Wilfred Hilda and Filbert
LAFB-143||it was the Pleasant Grove School that went from kindergarten through 8th grade
LAFB-144||it was two miles outside the city limits and I guess there was no problem about our attending because we were the only Negroes in the area
LAFB-145||in those days white people in the north usually would adopt just a few Negroes they didn't see them as any threat
LAFB-146||the white kid didn't make any great thing about it's either they called us.
LAFB-147||daki and rastas so much that we thought those were unnatural names but they didn't think of it as an insult it was just the way they thought about us
LAFB-148||one afternoon in 1931 when Wilfred Hilda filbert not came home
LAFB-149||my mother and father were having one of their arguments they had been lately a lot of tension around the house because of black Legion threats anyway my father had taken one of the rabbits which we were raising and ordered my mother to cook it
LAFB-150||we raised rabbits but sold them to whites
LAFB-151||my father had taken a rabbit from the rabbit pin he had pulled off the rabbit's head he was so strong he needed no knife to behead chickens are rabbits with one Twist of his big black hands is simply Twisted off the head and through the bleeding naked thing back at my mother's feet
LAFB-152||my mother was crying she started to skin the rabbit Preparatory to cooking it
LAFB-153||but my father was so angry he slammed on out of the front door and started walking up the road towards
LAFB-154||it was then that my mother had this vision
LAFB-155||she's always been a strange woman in this sense and it always had a strong intuition two things about to happen and most of our children with the same way I think
LAFB-156||what something is about to happen I can feel something sent something
LAFB-157||I've never known something to happen that is caught me completely off-guard except once
LAFB-158||and that was when years later I discovered facts I couldn't believe about a man who up until that discovery
LAFB-159||I would gladly have given my life for my father was well up the road with my mother and screaming out onto the porch
LAFB-160||pre plucked up an apron in one hand and ran down across the yard and into the road
LAFB-161||my father turned around he saw her for some reason considering how angry he had been when he left he waved at her
LAFB-162||but he kept on going she told me later my mother did that she had a vision of my father's end
LAFB-163||all the rest of the afternoon she was not herself
LAFB-164||crying and nervous and upset she finished cooking the rabbit and put the whole thing in the warmer pot of the black stove
LAFB-165||when my father was not back home by our bedtime
LAFB-166||my mother hug and clutched us and we felt strange not knowing what to do because she had never acted like that
LAFB-167||I remember waking up to the sound of my mother screaming again
LAFB-168||when I scrambled out I saw the police in the living room they were trying to calm her down she had snatched on her clothes to go with them and all of us children who were staring new without anyone having to say it that something terrible that happened to our father
LAFB-169||my mother was taken by the police to the hospital into a room where is sheet was over my father in the bed and she wouldn't look she was afraid to look
LAFB-170||probably it was wise but she didn't my father's skull on one side was crushed and I was told later
LAFB-171||Negroes in Lansing of always whispered that he was attacked and then laid across some tracks for A Streetcar to run
LAFB-172||over his body was cut almost in half
LAFB-173||he live two and a half hours in that condition
LAFB-174||Negroes Den was stronger than they are now specially Georgia Negroes
LAFB-175||Negroes born in Georgia had to be strong simply to survive
LAFB-176||it was morning when we children at home got the word that he was dead
LAFB-177||I was six I can remember a vague commotion the house filled up with people crying saying bitterly that the white black Legion had finally gotten him
LAFB-178||my mother was hysterical in the bedroom when will holding smelling salts under her nose she was still hysterical at the funeral
LAFB-179||I don't have a very clear memory of the funeral either
LAFB-180||oddly the main thing I remember is that it wasn't in a church and that surprised me since my father was a preacher and I had been where he preached people's funerals in churches but his was in a funeral home
LAFB-181||and I remember the during the service a big black fly came down and land
LAFB-182||my father's face and Wilfred spring up from his charity shooed the fly away and he came groping back to his chair they were folding chairs for us to sit on and the tears were streaming down his face
LAFB-183||when we went by the casket I remember that I thought it looked as if my father's strong blackface have been dusted with flour and I wish they hadn't put on such a lot of it
LAFB-184||back in the big four-room house they were many visitors for another week or so
LAFB-185||they were good friends of the family such as the lions from Mason 12 miles away in the Walkers mcgwire's list goes the greens Randolph and the Turners and others from Lansing and a lot of people from other towns who might seen at the Garvey meetings
LAFB-186||we children adjusted more easily than our mother did
LAFB-187||we couldn't see as clearly as she did the trials that lay ahead
LAFB-188||as the visitors tapered off she became very concerned about collecting the to ensure
LAFB-189||policies that my father had always been proud he carried he had always said that family should be protected in case of death
LAFB-190||one policy apparently paid off without any problem the smaller one I don't know the amount of it I would have imagined it was not more than $1,000 and maybe half of that
LAFB-191||but after that money came in my mother had paid out a lot of it for the funeral and expenses she began going into town and returning very upset
LAFB-192||the company that issued the biggest policy was balking at paying off they were claiming that my father had committed suicide
LAFB-193||visitors came again and it was bitter talked about white people
LAFB-194||How Could my father Bears himself in the head then get down across the street car tracks to be run over
LAFB-195||so there we were my mother was 34 years old now with no husband no provider or protector
LAFB-196||take care of her eight children but some kind of family routine got going again and for as long as the first insurance money lasted we did all right
LAFB-197||Wilfred who was a pretty stable fellow began to act older than his age
LAFB-198||I think he had the sense to see when the rest of us didn't what was in the wind for us
LAFB-199||he quietly quit school and went to town in search of work
LAFB-200||he took any kind of job you could find and he would come home dog tired in the evenings and give whatever he had made to my mother
LAFB-201||Hilda who had been quiet too attended to the babies
LAFB-202||Gilbert and I didn't contribute anything we fought all the time each other at home and then it's cool we would team up and fight white kid sometimes the fights would be racial in nature but they might be about anyting
LAFB-203||Reginald came under my wing since he had grown out of the toppling stage he and I had to come very close
LAFB-204||I suppose I enjoyed the fact that he was the little one under me who looked up to me
LAFB-205||my mother began to buy on credit my father had always been very strongly against credit
LAFB-206||credit is the first step into debt and back into slavery he it always said
LAFB-207||and then she went to work herself she would going to Lansing to find different jobs in housework or sewing for white people
LAFB-208||they didn't realize usually that she was a negro a lot of white people around there didn't mark Negroes in that houses
LAFB-209||she would do fine until someway or eyelid got two people who she was whose widowed she was and then she would be let go
LAFB-210||I remember how she used to come home crying but trying to hide it because she had lost the job that she needed so much
LAFB-211||once when one of us I cannot remember which had to go for something to where she was working and the people Sauced and realize she was actually a negro she was fired on the spot
LAFB-212||and she came home I'm crying this time not hiding it
LAFB-213||when the state welfare people began coming to our house we would come from school sometimes and find them talkin with our mother asking a thousand questions
LAFB-214||they acted in look at her and that us and around in our house and awake that had about it the feeling at least for me that we will not people in their eyesight we were just things that was all
LAFB-216||we began to go swiftly downhill the physical downhill wasn't as quick as the psychological my mother was above everything else a proud woman and it took
LAFB-217||toll on her that she was accepting charity and her feelings will communicated to us
LAFB-219||but the monthly welfare check was there pass
LAFB-220||they acted as if they owned us as if we were their private property as much as my mother would have liked to she couldn't keep them out
LAFB-221||she would get particularly incensed when they began insisting upon drawing us older children aside one at a time out on the porch or somewhere and asking us questions or telling us things against our mother and against each other
LAFB-222||we couldn't understand why if the state was willing to give us packages of meat sacks
LAFB-223||bagels and fruit and cans of all kinds of things I will mother obviously hate it too except we really couldn't understand
LAFB-224||what I later understood was that my mother was making a desperate effort to preserve her pride and hours
LAFB-225||Pride was just about all we had to preserve for by 1934 we really began to suffer this was about the worst depression year
LAFB-226||and no one we knew had enough to eat all live on
LAFB-227||some old family friends visited us now and then at first they brought food though it was charity my mother took
LAFB-228||Wilfred was working to help my mother was working when she could bind any kind of job
LAFB-229||in Lansing there was a bakery store for a nickel a couple of us children would buy at all flour sack of day-old bread and cookies and then walk the two
LAFB-230||files back out into the country to our house
LAFB-231||our mother knew I guess dozens of ways to cook things with bread and out of bread
LAFB-232||stewed tomatoes with bread maybe that would be a meal
LAFB-233||something like French toast if we had any eggs
LAFB-234||bread pudding sometimes with raisins in it
LAFB-235||if we got a hold of some hamburger it came to the table more bread than meat
LAFB-236||the cookies that will always in the sack with the bread we just gobbled down straight
LAFB-237||but there were times when there wasn't even a nickel
LAFB-238||and we would be so hungry we would dizzy my mother would boil a big pot of dandelion greens and we would eat that
LAFB-239||I remember that some small minded neighbor put it out
LAFB-240||children with teases and we ate fried grass
LAFB-241||sometimes if we were lucky we would have oatmeal or cornmeal mush three times a day or mush in the morning and Cornbread at night
LAFB-242||filbert and I were grown-up enough to quit fighting
LAFB-243||long enough to take the 22 caliber rifle that have been our fathers and shoot rabbits at some white neighbors up or down the road would buy
LAFB-244||I know now they just did it to help us because they like everyone shot their own rabbits
LAFB-245||sometimes I remember filbert and I would take little Reginald along with us he wasn't very strong but he was always so proud to be alone
LAFB-246||we would trap muskrats out in a little creek and back of our house and we would like quiet until unsuspecting bullfrogs appeared and we would spear them cut off their legs and sell them for a nickel a two people who lived up and down the road
LAFB-247||the white seemed less restricted in their dietary taste
LAFB-248||then in about late 19:34 I would guess something began to happen
LAFB-249||some kind of psychological deterioration hit our family Circle began to eat away our pride
LAFB-250||perhaps it was the constant tangible evidence that we would destitute
LAFB-251||we had known of the families who have gone laundry
LAFB-252||we had known without anyone in our home ever expressing it that we had felt prouder not to be at the Depot where the free food was passed out and now we were among them
LAFB-253||it's cool the awesome relief finger suddenly was pointed at us too and sometimes it was said aloud
LAFB-254||it seemed that everything to eat in our house was stamped not to be sold
LAFB-255||old welfare food boil this stamp to keep the recipients from selling it
LAFB-256||it's a wonder we didn't come to think of not to be sold as a brand name
LAFB-257||sometimes instead of going home from school I walked the two miles up the road to Lansing
LAFB-258||I began drifting from store to store hanging around outside with things like apples were displayed in boxes and barrels and baskets and I would watch my chance and steal me a tree
LAFB-259||you know what a treat was to me anyting
LAFB-260||or I began to drop in about dinner time at the home of some family that we knew I knew that they knew exactly why I was there but they never embarrass me by letting on they would invite me to stay for supper and I would stuff myself
LAFB-261||especially I like to drop in and visit the go harnesses home
LAFB-262||they were nice older people and great church-goers I had watched them lead the jumping and shouting when my father preached
LAFB-263||they had living with them they were raising him a nephew who everyone called big boy and he and I got along fine
LAFB-265||Malcolm is one thing I like about you you're no good what you don't try to hide it you are not a hypocrite
LAFB-266||the more I began to stay away from home and visit people and steal from the store's the more aggressive I became in my inclination I never wanted to wait for anything
LAFB-267||I was growing up fast physically more so than mentally
LAFB-269||when I began to get caught stealing now and then the state welfare people began to focus on me when they came to our house I can't remember how I first became aware that they were talking of taking me away
LAFB-270||what I first remember along that line was my mother raising a
LAFB-271||about being able to bring up her own children
LAFB-272||she would whip me for stealing and I will try to alarm the neighborhood with my yelling
LAFB-273||one thing I've always been proud of is that I never raised my hand against my mother
LAFB-274||in the summertime at night in addition to all the other things we did some of us boys would slip out down the road or across the pastures and go cooning watermelon
LAFB-275||white people always Associated watermelons with Negroes and they sometimes called Negroes Coombs among all the other names and so stealing watermelons they came cooling them
LAFB-276||if white boys would doing it it implied that they were only acting like Negroes
LAFB-277||whites have always hidden or Justified all the gifts they could buy ridiculing or blaming Negroes
LAFB-278||one Halloween night I remember that a bunch of us were out tipping over those old country outhouses
LAFB-279||in one old farmer I guess he had tipped over enough in his day had set a trap for us
LAFB-280||always you sneak up from behind the Outhouse then you gain together and push it to tip it over
LAFB-281||this farmer had taken his outhouse off the whole and set it just in front of the whole
LAFB-282||well we came sneaking up in single file in the darkness and the two white boys in the lead fell down into the Outhouse hole neck-deep
LAFB-283||they smelled so bad it was all we could stand to get them out and that finished us all for that Halloween
LAFB-284||I had just missed falling in myself the whites was so used to taking the lead this time it had really gotten them in the hole
LAFB-285||Gus in various ways I learned various things
LAFB-286||I pick strawberries and though I can't recall what I got for crate for picking
LAFB-287||I remember that after working hard all one day
LAFB-288||I wound up with about a dollar which was a whole lot of money in those times
LAFB-289||I was so hungry I didn't know what to do
LAFB-290||I was walking away toward town with visions of buying something good to eat and this older white boy I knew Richard Dixon came up and asked me if I wanted to match nickels he had plenty of change for my dollar
LAFB-291||in about a half an hour he had all the change back including my dollar and instead of going to town to buy something I went home with nothing and I was bitter
LAFB-292||but that was nothing compared to what I felt when I found out later that he had cheated
LAFB-293||there's a way that you can catch and hold a nickel and make it come up the way you want
LAFB-294||this was my first lesson about gambling
LAFB-295||if you see somebody winning all the time he isn't gambling he's cheating
LAFB-296||later on in life if I were continuously losing in any gambling C
LAFB-297||wishing I would watch very closely it's like the Negro in America seeing the white man win all the time
LAFB-298||he's a professional Gambler he has all the cards and the odds stacked on his side and he has always dealt with our people from the bottom of the deck
LAFB-299||about this time my mother began to be visited by some Seventh-Day Adventists who would moved into a house not too far down the road from us
LAFB-300||they would talk to her for hours at a time and leave booklets and leaflets and magazines for her to read she read them and Wilfred who had started back to schools after we had the gun to get the relief Food Supplies also read a lot his head was forever in some book
LAFB-301||before long my mother spent much time with the Adventist it's my belief that what mostly influenced her was that they had even more diet restrictions than she had thought and practice with us
LAFB-302||like us they were against eating rabbit and pork
LAFB-303||they followed the Mosaic dietary laws they ain't nothing of the flesh without a split hoof or they didn't you cut
LAFB-304||we began to go with my mother to the aventus meetings that were held further out in the country
LAFB-305||a children I know that the major attraction was the good food they served but we listen to
LAFB-306||there were a handful of negroes from small towns in the area but I would say that it was 99% white people
LAFB-307||the Adventists felt that they were living at the end of time that the world soon was coming to an end
LAFB-308||but they were the friendliest white people I had ever seen in some ways though we children noticed and when we were back at home discussed that they were different from us such as the lack of enough seasoning in their food and the different way that white people smell
LAFB-309||meanwhile the state welfare people kept after my mother by now she didn't make it any secret that she hated them and didn't want them in her house but
LAFB-311||I think that they felt that getting children in the foster homes was a legitimate part of their function and the result would be less Troublesome however they went about it
LAFB-313||Dubai the welfare workers that our mother was losing her mind
LAFB-315||they were is vicious as vultures they had no feelings understanding Compassion or respect for my mother they told us she's crazy for refusing food
LAFB-316||right then was when our home our Unity began to disintegrate
LAFB-317||we were having a hard time and I wasn't helping but we could have made it we could have stayed to
LAFB-318||as bad as I was as much trouble and worry as I called my mother I loved her
LAFB-319||the state people we found out had an interview to go hannes family and the Gohan has had said that they would take me into their home my mother threw a fit do when she heard that and the home Wreckers took cover for a while
LAFB-320||it was about this time that the large dark man from Lansing began visiting
LAFB-321||I don't remember how or where he and my mother met
LAFB-322||it may have been through some mutual friends I don't remember what the man's profession was in 1935 and lensing Negroes didn't have anything you could call a profession
LAFB-323||but the man big and black looks something like my father
LAFB-324||I can't remember his name but there's no need to mention it he was a single man and my mother was a widow only 36 years old
LAFB-325||the man was independent naturally she admired that
LAFB-326||she was having a hard time disciplining us at a big man's presence alone would help
LAFB-327||and if she had a man to provide it would send the state people away forever
LAFB-328||we all understood without ever saying much about
LAFB-329||or at least we had no objection we took it in stride even with some amusement Among Us that when the man came our mother would be all dressed up in the best that she had
LAFB-330||she was still a good-looking woman and she would act differently lighthearted and laughing as we hadn't seen her act in years
LAFB-331||it went on for about a year I guess and then about 1936 or 1937
LAFB-332||the man from Lansing jilted my mother suddenly
LAFB-333||he just stopped coming to see her from what I later understood he finally backed away from taking on the responsibility of those eight mouths to feed
LAFB-334||he was afraid of so many of
LAFB-335||to this day I can see the Trap that my mother was in Saddle with all of us and I can also understand why he would shun taking on such a tremendous responsibility
LAFB-336||but it was a terrible shock to her it was the beginning of the end of reality for my mother
LAFB-337||when she began to sit around and walk around talking to herself almost as though she was unaware that we were there it became increasingly terrifying
LAFB-338||the state people saw her weakening and that was when they began the definite step to take me away from home
LAFB-339||they began to tell me how nice it was going to be at the Gowanus home where the go harnesses and big boy and Mrs Adcock at all said how much they like me and would like to have me live with them I like all of them too
LAFB-340||but I didn't want to leave Wilfred I looked up to and admire my big brother I didn't want to leave
LAFB-342||as my mother talked to herself more and more she gradually became less responsive to us and less responsible
LAFB-343||the house became less tidy we began to be more unkempt and usually now he'll decook
LAFB-344||we children watched our anchor giving way it was something terrible that you couldn't get your hands on yet you couldn't get away from
LAFB-345||it was a sensing that something bad was going to happen
LAFB-346||we younger ones lean more and more heavily on the relative strength of Wilfred and Hilda who were the oldest
LAFB-347||when finally I was sent to the galanes home at least in a surface way I was glad
LAFB-348||I remember that when I left home with the state man my mother said one thing don't let them feed him any Pig
LAFB-349||it was better in a lot of ways at the Gowanus
LAFB-350||big boy and I shared his room together and we hit it off nicely he just wasn't the same as my blood brothers
LAFB-351||the Gowanus is were very religious people
LAFB-353||it was spooky with ghosts and spirituals and ain't seeming to be in the very atmosphere when finally
LAFB-354||we all came out of the church going back home
LAFB-355||double harnesses in Mrs Adcock love to go fishing and some Saturdays big boy and I would go a long
LAFB-356||I had changed schools now to Lansing West Junior High School
LAFB-357||it was right in the heart of the Negro community in a few white kids were there but big boy didn't mix much with any of our schoolmates and I didn't either
LAFB-358||and when we went fishing neither he or I like the idea of just sitting in waiting for the fish to drip the cork under the water or make the tightline quiver when we fish that way
LAFB-359||I figured they should have been some smart a way to get the fish though we never discovered what it might be
LAFB-360||mystical harness was closed cronies with some other man who some Saturdays would take me and big boy with them hunting rabbits
LAFB-361||I had my father's 22 caliber rifle my mother had said it was all right to take it with me
LAFB-362||the old man had a set rabbit hunting strategy
LAFB-363||they had always used usually when a dog jumps a rabbit and the rabbit gets away that rabbit will always somehow instinctively run in a circle and return sooner or later past the very spot where he originally was jumped
LAFB-364||well the old man would just sit and wait in hiding somewhere for the rabbit to come back then get their shots at him
LAFB-365||I got to thinking about it and finally I thought of a plan
LAFB-366||I would separate from them and big boy and I would go to a point where I figured that the rabbit returning would have to pass me first
LAFB-367||it worked like magic I began to get three or four rabbits before they got one
LAFB-368||the astonishing thing was that none of the old men ever figured out why
LAFB-369||they outdid themselves explaining what a short shot I was
LAFB-370||I was about 12 then all I had done was to improve on their strategy and it was the beginning
LAFB-371||a very important lesson in life that anytime you find someone more successful than you are especially when you're both engaged in the same business you know they're doing something that you are
LAFB-372||I would return home to visit fairly often sometimes big boy and one or another or both of the go harnesses would go with me sometimes not
LAFB-373||I would be glad when some of them did go because it made the ordeal easier
LAFB-374||soon the state people were making plans to take over all of my mother's children
LAFB-375||she talked to herself nearly all of the time now and there was a crowd of new white people entering the picture always asking questions
LAFB-376||they would even visit me at the Go harnesses they would ask me questions out on the porch or sitting out in their cars
LAFB-377||eventually my mother suffered a complete breakdown
LAFB-378||and the court orders were finally sign
LAFB-379||they took her to the State Mental Hospital in Kalamazoo
LAFB-380||it was 70 some miles from Lansing about an hour and a half on the bus
LAFB-382||my mother remained in the same hospital at Kalamazoo
LAFB-383||for about 26 years later when I was still growing up in Michigan
LAFB-384||I would go to visit her every so often nothing that I can imagine could have moved me as deeply as seeing her pitiful state
LAFB-385||the 1963 we got my mother out of the hospital and she now lives there in Lansing with filbert in his family
LAFB-386||it was so much worse than if it had been a physical sickness for which a cars might be known medicine given a cure effective
LAFB-387||every time I visited her when finally they led her a case a number back inside from where we had been sitting together I felt worse
LAFB-388||my last visit when I knew I would never come to see her again there
LAFB-389||was in 1952 I was 27
LAFB-390||my brother Philbin had told me that on his last visit she had recognized him somewhat in spots he said
LAFB-391||but you didn't recognize me at all she stared at me she didn't know who I was
LAFB-392||remind when I tried to talk to reach her with somewhere else I asked Mama do you know what day it is
LAFB-393||she said staring all the people have gone
LAFB-394||I can't describe how I felt
LAFB-395||the woman who had brought me into the world and nursed me and advised me and chastise me and loved me didn't know me
LAFB-396||it was as if I was trying to walk up the side of a hill of feathers
LAFB-397||I looked at her I listen to her talk but there was nothing I could do
LAFB-398||I truly believe that if ever a state social agency destroyed a family it destroy hours
LAFB-399||we wanted and tried to stay together our home didn't have to be destroyed
LAFB-400||but the welfare the courts and their doctor gave us the 1-2-3 punch
LAFB-401||and I was was not the only case of this time
LAFB-402||I knew I wouldn't be back to see my mother again because it could make me a very vicious and dangerous person
LAFB-403||knowing how they had looked at us as numbers and as a casein
LAFB-404||a book not if you would be and knowing that my mother in there was a statistic that didn't have to be that existed because of a society's failure hypocrisies greed and lack of mercy and compassion
LAFB-405||pimps have I no mercy or compassion in me for a society that will crush people and then penalize them but not being able to stand up under the weight
LAFB-406||I have rarely talk to anyone about my mother
LAFB-407||but I believe that I am capable of killing a person without hesitation who happened to make the wrong kind of remark about my mother so I purposely don't make any openings for some food to step into
LAFB-408||back then our family was destroyed in 1937 Wilfred and Hilda were old enough so that the state let them stay on their own in the big four-room house at
LAFB-410||separated that we were all of us maintain fairly close touch around Landing in school and out whenever we could get together
LAFB-411||despite the artificially created separation and distance between us we still remain very close in our feelings toward each other
LAFB-414||my brother Philbert who had already become a pretty good boxer in school was no exception
LAFB-415||I was trying to play basketball I was gangling and Tall but I wasn't very good at it too awkward
LAFB-416||in the fall of that year bilbrough entered the amateur boss that were held in Lansing Pruden Auditorium
LAFB-417||he did well surviving the increasingly tough eliminations
LAFB-418||I would go down to the gym and watch him train it was very exciting
LAFB-419||perhaps without realizing it I became secretly envious for one thing
LAFB-420||I know I could not help seeing some of my younger brother Reginald
LAFB-421||lifelong admiration for me getting siphoned off to filbert
LAFB-422||people praise filbert as a natural boxer
LAFB-423||I figured that since we belong to the same family maybe I would become one too
LAFB-425||they Mac me with a white boy a novice like myself named Bill Peterson I'll never forget him
LAFB-426||when I turn in the next amateur bouts came up
LAFB-427||all of my brothers and sisters were there watching along with just about everyone else I knew in town
LAFB-428||they were there not so much because of me but because of filbert who had begun to build up a pretty good following and they wanted to see how his brother would do
LAFB-429||walk down the aisle between the people thronging the rows of seats and climbed in the ring
LAFB-430||Bill Peterson and I were introduced and then the referee called us together and mumbled all of that stuff about fighting fair and breaking clean then the bell rang and we came out of our corners
LAFB-431||I knew I was scared but I didn't know is Bill Peterson told me later on that he was scared of me too
LAFB-432||he was so scared I was going to hurt him that he knocked me down 50 times if you did once
LAFB-433||he did such a job on my reputation in the Negro neighborhoods that I practically went into hiding
LAFB-435||when I did show my face again
LAFB-436||Negroes I knew rode me so badly I knew I had to do something
LAFB-437||but the worst of my humiliation
LAFB-438||was my younger brother Reginald attitude
LAFB-439||he simply never mentioned the fight it was the way he looked at me and avoided looking at me
LAFB-440||so I went back to the gym and I trained hard
LAFB-441||I beeped bags and skip rope and grunted and sweat it all over the place and finally I signed up to fight Bill Peterson again this time the bouts were held in his hometown of Alma Michigan
LAFB-442||the only thing better about the rematch was that hardly anyone I knew was there to see it
LAFB-443||I was particularly grateful for Reginald's absence
LAFB-444||the moment the bell rang I saw a fist then the canvas coming up and 10 seconds later the referee was saying 10 over me
LAFB-445||it was probably the shortest fight in history
LAFB-446||I lay there listening to the Full Count but I couldn't move to tell the truth I'm not sure I wanted to move
LAFB-447||that white boy was the beginning and end of my fight career
LAFB-448||a lot of times in these years later since I've become a Muslim
LAFB-449||I thought back to that fight and reflected that it was all eyes work to stop me
LAFB-450||I might Wanda Punchy not long after this I came into a classroom with my hat on I did it deliberately
LAFB-451||the teacher who was white ordered me to keep the hat on and to walk around and around the room until he told me to stop
LAFB-452||that way he said everyone can see you
LAFB-453||meanwhile will go on with class for those who are here to learn something
LAFB-454||I was still walking around when he got up from his desk and turn to the Blackboard to write something on it
LAFB-455||everyone in the classroom was looking when at this moment
LAFB-456||I passed behind his desk snapped up a thumbtack and
LAFB-457||posited it in his chair when he turned to sit back down I was far from the scene of the crime circling around the rear of the room then he hit the back and I heard him holler and caught a glimpse of him spradling up as I Disappeared through the door
LAFB-458||with my deportment record I wasn't really shocked when the decision came that I have been expelled
LAFB-459||I guess I must have had some vague idea that if I didn't have to go to school I'd be allowed to stay on with the Gohan asses and wander around town or maybe get a job if I wanted one for pocket money
LAFB-460||but I got rocked on my heels when a state man whom I hadn't seen before came and got me at the glow harnesses and took me down to court
LAFB-461||they told me I was going to a reform school
LAFB-462||I was still 13 years old but first I was going to the detention home
LAFB-463||it was in Mason Michigan about 12 miles from Landing
LAFB-464||the detention home was where all the bad
LAFB-465||boys and girls from Ingham County where held on their way to reform school waiting for their hearings
LAFB-466||the white State man was a mistermainer to Allen he was nicer to me than most of the state welfare people had been
LAFB-467||even had consoling words for the Gahanna sce's and Mrs Adcock and Big Boi all of them were crying but I wasn't
LAFB-468||with the few clothes I owned stuffed into a box we rode in his car to Mason
LAFB-469||he talked as we drove along saying that my school Mark showed that if I would just straighten up I could make something of myself
LAFB-470||he said that reform school had the wrong reputation he talked about what the word reformed meant to change and become better
LAFB-471||he said the school was really a place where boys like me could have time to see their mistakes and start a new life and become somebody everyone could be proud of
LAFB-472||Andy told me that the lady in charge of the detention home a Mrs swirling and her husband were very good people
LAFB-473||they were good people mrs. swirling was bigger than her husband
LAFB-474||I remember a big Buxom robust laughing woman and Mr swirling was thin with black hair and a black Moustache and a red face quiet and polite even to me
LAFB-475||they liked me right away to mrs. swirling showed me to my room my own room the first in my life
LAFB-476||it was one of those huge dormitory like buildings where kids in detention were kept in those days and still are in most places
LAFB-477||I discovered next with surprised that I was allowed to eat with the swirling it was the first time I eaten with white people at least with grown white people since the Seventh-day Adventist country meetings it wasn't my own exclusive privilege of course
LAFB-478||except for the very Troublesome boys and girls at the detention home who were kept locked up those who would run away
LAFB-479||have been caught and brought back or something like that all of us ate with the swirling sitting at the head of the long tables
LAFB-480||they had a white cook helper I recall Lucille Lathrop
LAFB-481||it amazes me how these names come back from a time I haven't thought about for more than 20 years
LAFB-482||Lucille treated me well to her husband's name was Dwayne Lathrop he works somewhere else but he stayed there at the detention home on the weekends with Lucille
LAFB-484||they all like my attitude and it was out of it liking for me that I soon became accepted by them as a mascot I know now
LAFB-485||they would talk about anything and everything with me standing right there hearing them the same way people would
LAFB-487||it was the same with the cook Lucille and her husband Dwayne
LAFB-488||I remember one day when Mr swirling is nice as he was came in from Lansing where he had been through the Negro section and said to mrs. swirling right in front of me
LAFB-489||I just can't see how those niggars can be so happy and be so poor
LAFB-490||he talked about how they lived in Shacks but had those big shining cars out front
LAFB-491||and Mrs swirling said me standing right there
LAFB-492||niggars are just that way that's seem always stayed with me
LAFB-493||it was the same with the other white people most of them local politicians when they would come over
LAFB-494||hitting the swirling what are their favorite parlor topics was niggars
LAFB-496||I knew they must have told him how I acted and how I worked
LAFB-497||what I am trying to say is that it just never dawned upon them that I could understand that I wasn't a pet but a human being
LAFB-498||they didn't give me credit for having the same sensitivity intellect and understanding that they would have been ready and willing to recognize in a white boy in my position
LAFB-499||but it has historically been the case with white people in their regard for black people that even though we might be with them we weren't
LAFB-500||considered of them even though they appear to have opened the door it was still closed thus they never did really see me
LAFB-502||but I was no more than vaguely aware of anything like that in my detention home years
LAFB-503||I did my little chores around the house and everything was fine
LAFB-504||and each weekend they didn't mind my catching a ride over to Lansing for the afternoon or evening
LAFB-505||if I wasn't old enough I sure was Big Enough by then and nobody ever question my hanging out even at night in the streets of the Negro section
LAFB-506||I was growing up to be even bigger than Wilford and Filbert who had begun to meet girls at the school dances and other places and introduce me to a few
LAFB-507||but the ones who seemed to like me I didn't go for and vice versa
LAFB-508||I couldn't dance a lick anyway and I couldn't see squandering my few dimes on girls
LAFB-509||so mostly I pleasured myself these Saturday night like walking around the Negro bars and restaurants
LAFB-510||the jukeboxes were wailing Erskine Hawkins Tuxedo Junction slim and slams flat foot floogie things like that
LAFB-511||sometimes big bands from New York out touring one-night-stands in the sticks would play
LAFB-512||big dances in Lansing everybody would legs would come out to see any performer Who Bore the magic name New York
LAFB-513||which is how I first heard lucky Thompson and Milt Jackson both of whom I later got to Nowell and Harlem
LAFB-514||many youngsters from the detention home when their dates came up went off to the reform school but when mine came up two or three times it was always ignored
LAFB-515||I saw a new youngsters arrive and leave I was glad and grateful I knew it was missing swirling two doing
LAFB-516||I didn't want to leave she finally told me one day that I was going to be entered in Mason Junior High School
LAFB-517||it was the only School in town no water the detention home at ever gone to school there at least while still award So I entered their seventh grade
LAFB-518||the only other Negroes there was some of the Lions children younger than I was in the lower grades
LAFB-519||I understand eyes it happened with the town's only Negroes
LAFB-520||they were as Negroes very much respected mrliance was a smart hard-working man and misses Lions was a very good woman she and my mother I had heard my mother say we're two of the four West Indians in that whole section of Michigan
LAFB-522||I was in demand I had top priority
LAFB-523||but I also benefited from the special Prestige of having the seal of approval from that very important woman about the town of Mason misses swirling nobody and Mason would have dreamed of getting on the road
LAFB-525||and I hadn't been in the school long when mrs. swirling knowing I could use spending money of my own got me a job after school washing the dishes in a local restaurant
LAFB-526||my boss there was the father of a white classmate whom I spend a lot of time with
LAFB-527||his family lived over the restaurant it was fine working there
LAFB-528||every Friday night when I got paid I'd feel at least 10 ft tall
LAFB-529||I forget how much I made but it seemed like a lot it was the first time I'd ever had any money to speak of all my own in my whole life
LAFB-530||as soon as I could afford it I bought a green suit and some shoes and it's cool
LAFB-531||buy treats for the others in my class at least as much as any of them did for me
LAFB-532||English and history with a subject I like the most my English teacher I recalled a mr. ostrowski was always giving advice about how to become something in life
LAFB-533||the one thing I didn't like about history class was that the teacher mr. Williams was a great one for Niger jokes
LAFB-534||one day during my first week at school I walked into the room and he started singing to the class as a joke
LAFB-535||Way Down Yonder in the cotton field some folks say that a Niger won't steal
LAFB-536||very funny I like history but I never thereafter had much liking for mr. Williams
LAFB-537||later I remember we came to the textbook section on negro history
LAFB-538||it was exactly one paragraph long mr. Williams last through it practically in a single breath reading aloud how the Negroes have been slaves and then
LAFB-539||greed and how they were usually lazy and dumb and shiftless he added I remember an anthropological footnote on his own telling us between last how Negroes feet was so big that when they walk they don't leave tracks they leave a hole in the ground
LAFB-540||I'm sorry to say that the subject I most dislike was mathematics I thought about
LAFB-541||I think the reason was that mathematically is no room for argument if you made a mistake that was all there was to
LAFB-543||it didn't bother my teammates all my coach at all and to tell the truth it bothered me only vaguely
LAFB-544||mine was the same psychology that make Negroes even today though it bothers them down inside keep letting the white
LAFB-545||man tell them how much progress they're making they've heard it so much they've almost gotten brainwashed into believing it or at least accepting
LAFB-546||after the basketball games they would usually be a school dance
LAFB-547||whenever our team walk into another school's gym for the dance with me among them I could feel the freeze
LAFB-548||it would start to ease as they saw I didn't try to mix but stuck close to someone on our team or kept to myself
LAFB-550||it was some kind of psychic message not just from them but also From Within Myself
LAFB-551||I am proud to be able to save that much for myself at least
LAFB-552||I was just standing around and smile and talk and drink punch and eat sandwiches and then I would make some excuse and get away early
LAFB-554||I used to spend a lot of time thinking about a peculiar thing
LAFB-555||many of these Mason white boys like the ones at the Lansing school especially if they knew me well and if we hung out a lot together
LAFB-556||would get me off in a corner somewhere and push me to proposition certain white girls sometimes their own sisters they would tell me that they already had the girls themselves including their sisters or that they were trying to and couldn't
LAFB-557||later on I came to understand what was going on
LAFB-558||if they could get the girls into the position of having broken the terrible taboo by slipping off with me somewhere they would have that hammer over the girls heads to make them give into them
LAFB-559||it seemed that the white boys felt that I being a negro just naturally knew more about romance or sex than they did that I instinctively knew more about what to do and say what their own girls
LAFB-560||I never did tell anybody that I really went for some of the white girls and some of them went for me too
LAFB-561||they let me know in many ways but anytime we found ourselves in any close conversations or potentially intimate situation always there would come up between us some kind of a wall
LAFB-562||the girls I really wanted to have were a couple of negro girls Wilfred or filbert had introduced me to in Lansing but
LAFB-563||these girls somehow I like the nerve
LAFB-564||from what I heard and saw on the Saturday night I spent hanging around in the Negro District
LAFB-565||I knew the race mixing went on in Lansing
LAFB-566||but strangely enough this didn't have any kind of effect on me
LAFB-567||every negro in Lansing I guess knew how white men would drive along certain streets in the black neighborhoods and pick up negro streetwalkers who patrolled the area and on the other hand
LAFB-568||there was a bridge that separated the Negro and polish neighborhoods where white women would drive or walk across to pick up negro man who would hang around in certain places close to the bridge waiting for them
LAFB-569||lansing's white women even in those days what famous for chasing negro man
LAFB-570||I didn't get appreciate how most whites occurred to the Negro this reputation for prodigious sexual
LAFB-571||they're in Lansing I never heard of any trouble about this mixing from either side
LAFB-572||I imagine that everyone simply took it for granted as I did
LAFB-573||anyway from my experience as a little boy at the Lansing school I had become fairly Adept at avoiding the white girl issue at least for a couple of years yet
LAFB-574||then in the second semester of the 7th grade I was elected class president
LAFB-575||it surprised me even more than other people
LAFB-577||that he's wasting his time straining to integrate
LAFB-578||I know from personal experience I tried hard enough
LAFB-579||Malcolm we're just so proud of you mrs. swirling exclaimed when she heard about my election it was all over the restaurant where I work even the state Man Maynard Allen who still drop by to see me once in awhile had a word of praise
LAFB-580||he said he never saw anybody proved better exactly what reform meant
LAFB-581||I really liked him except for one thing he now and then would drop something that hinted my mother had let us down somehow
LAFB-582||fairly often I would go and visit the Lions has and they acted as happy as though I was one of their children
LAFB-583||and it was the same warm feeling when I went into Lansing to visit my brothers and sisters and the Gohan us'
LAFB-584||I remember one thing that marred this time for me
LAFB-585||the movie Gone With the Wind when it played in Mason I was the only negro in the theater and when Butterfly McQueen went into her act
LAFB-586||I felt like crawling under the rug
LAFB-587||every Saturday just about I would go into Lansing
LAFB-588||I was going on 14 now Wilford and Hilda still lived out by themselves at the old family home
LAFB-589||Hilda kept the house very clean it was easier than my mother's plight with eight of us always underfoot of running around
LAFB-590||Wilfried work wherever he could and he still read every book he could get his hands on
LAFB-591||Gilbert was getting a reputation as one of the better amateur fighters in this part of the state everyone really expected that he was going to become a professional
LAFB-592||Reginald and I after my fighting Fiasco had finally gotten back on good terms
LAFB-593||it made me feel great to visit him and Wesley over it misses Williams's
LAFB-594||eyeball handedly give them each a couple of dollars to just stick in their pockets to have something to spend
LAFB-595||and Lavon and Robert were doing okay to over at the home of the West Indian lady mrs. Maguire I'd give them about a quarter apiece it made me feel good to see how they were coming along
LAFB-596||none of us talked much about our mother and we never mentioned Our Father
LAFB-597||I guess none of us knew what to say we didn't want anyone else to mention our mother either I think
LAFB-598||from time to time though we would all go over to Kalamazoo to visit her most often we older ones went singly
LAFB-599||bored with something you didn't want to have to experience with anyone else present even your brother or sister
LAFB-600||during this. The visit to my mother that I most remember was toward the end of that seventh grade year when our fathers grown Daughter by his first marriage Ella came from Boston to visit us
LAFB-601||Wilfred and Hilda had exchanged some letters with a
LAFB-602||and I at Hilda's suggestion had written to her from the swirling and we were all excited and happy when her letter told us that she was coming to Lansing
LAFB-603||I think the major impact of Ella's arrival at least upon me was that she was the first really proud black woman I had ever seen in my life
LAFB-604||she was plainly proud of her very dark skin this was unheard of among Negroes in those days especially in Lansing
LAFB-605||I hadn't been sure just what day she would come and then one afternoon I got home from school and there she was
LAFB-606||she hugged me stood me away look me up and down
LAFB-607||a commanding woman may be even bigger than mrs. swirling
LAFB-608||Ella wasn't just black but like our father she was jet black
LAFB-609||the way she sat moved thought did everything bespoke somebody who didn't God exactly what she wanted
LAFB-610||this was the woman my father had boasted of so often but having brought so many of their family out of Georgia to Boston
LAFB-611||own some property he would say she was in society
LAFB-613||all that I had heard was reflected in Ellis appearance and bearing
LAFB-614||I had never been so impressed with anybody
LAFB-615||she was in her second marriage her first husband had been a doctor
LAFB-616||Ella asked all kinds of questions about how I was doing
LAFB-617||she'd already heard from Wilfred and Hilda about my election as class
LAFB-618||president she asked especially about my grades and I ran and got my report cards
LAFB-619||I was then one of the three highest in class
LAFB-620||Ella praised me I asked her about her brother Earl and her sister Mary
LAFB-621||she had the exciting news that Earl was a singer with abandoned Boston he was singing under the name of Jimmy Carlton Mary was also doing well
LAFB-622||Ella told me about other relatives from that branch of the family A number of them I'd never heard of she had helped them up from Georgia they and their turn had helped up others we Littles have to stick together Ella said
LAFB-623||it's reeled me to hear her say that and even more the way she said
LAFB-624||I had become a mascot our branch of the family was split two pieces I had just about forgotten about being a little
LAFB-625||in any family since she said that different members of the family were working in good jobs and some even had small businesses going most of them were homeowners
LAFB-626||when Ella suggested that all of us Little's in Lansing accompany her on a visit to our mother we were all grateful
LAFB-627||we all felt that if anyone could do anything that could help our mother that might help her get well and come back it would be Ella anyway all of us for the first time together went with Ella to Kalamazoo
LAFB-628||our mother was smiling when they brought her out she was extremely surprised when she saw Ella
LAFB-629||they made a striking contrast the thin near white woman in the big black one hugging each other
LAFB-630||I don't remember much about the rest of the visit except that there was a lot of talking and Ella had everything in hand
LAFB-631||and we left with all of us feeling better than we ever had about the circumstances
LAFB-632||I know that for the first time I felt as though I had visited with someone who had some kind of physical illness that had just lingered on
LAFB-634||I jumped at the chance that summer of 1940 in Lansing I caught the Greyhound bus for Boston with my cardboard suitcase and wearing my green suit
LAFB-635||if someone had hung assign hick around my neck I couldn't have looked much more obvious
LAFB-636||they didn't have the turnpike's then the bus stopped at what seemed
LAFB-637||recorder and cow patch from my seat in you guessed it the back of the bus
LAFB-638||I got out of the window at White Man's America rolling passed for what seemed a month but must have been only a day and a half
LAFB-639||when we finally arrived element me at the terminal and took me home
LAFB-640||the house was on waumbek Street in The Sugarhill section of Roxbury the Harlem of Boston
LAFB-641||I met Ella second husband Frank who was now a soldier and her brother Earl the singer who called himself Jimmy Carlton
LAFB-642||and Mary who is very different from her older sister
LAFB-644||Ella was busily involved in dozens of things she belong to I don't know how many different clubs she was a Leading Light of local so-called black society
LAFB-645||I saw and met a hundred black people there whose big city talk and weighs left my mouth hanging open
LAFB-647||Neon Lights nightclubs pool halls Barth the cars they drove restaurants made the streets smell Rich greasy down-home black cooking
LAFB-648||jukeboxes Blaire Erskine Hawkins Juke Ellington cootie Williams dozens of others if somebody had told me then that someday I know them all
LAFB-649||personally I found it hard to believe
LAFB-650||the biggest bands like these played at the Roseland State Ballroom on Boston's Massachusetts Avenue 1920 grows the next night for whites
LAFB-651||I saw for the first time occasional black and white couple strolling around on and on and on Sundays when Ella Mario somebody took me to church I saw churches for black people such as I have never seen
LAFB-652||they were many times find it in the white church I attended back in Mason Michigan
LAFB-653||they are the white people just sat and worship with words but the Boston Negroes like all other Negroes I've ever seen at church through their souls and bodies holy into worship
LAFB-654||two or three times I wrote letters to Wilfred intended for everybody back in Lansing I said I'd try to describe it when I got back but I found I couldn't
LAFB-655||my restlessness with Mason and for the first time in my life
LAFB-657||the white people classmates the swirling the people at the restaurant where I worked notice the change they said you're acting so strange you don't seem like yourself Malcolm what's the matter
LAFB-658||I kept close to the top of the class though the topmost Scholastic standing I remember kept shifting between me a girl named Audrey slaw and a boy named Jimmy cotton
LAFB-659||it went on that way as I became increasingly restless and Disturbed through the first semester and then one day just about when those of us who had passed were about to move up to 8A from which we would enter Heise
LAFB-660||will the next year something happened which was to become the first major turning point of my life
LAFB-661||somehow I happen to be alone in the classroom with mr. ostrosky my English teacher
LAFB-662||he was a tall rather reddish white man and he had a thick mustache
LAFB-663||I had gotten some of my best marks under him and he had always made me feel that he liked me
LAFB-664||he was as I have mentioned a natural-born advisor about what you want to read to do or think about any and everything
LAFB-665||we used to make unkind jokes about him why was he teaching in Basin instead of somewhere else getting for himself some of the success in life that he kept telling us how to get
LAFB-666||I know that he probably meant well and what he happened to advise me that day I doubt that he meant any harm it was just in his nature as an American white man
LAFB-667||I was one of his top students one of the school's top students but all he could see for me with the kind of future in your place that almost all white people see for black people
LAFB-668||he told me Malcolm you off to be thinking about a career have you been giving it thought
LAFB-669||the truth is I hadn't I never have figured out why I told him well yes sir I've been thinking I'd like to be a lawyer
LAFB-670||Lansing certainly had no negro lawyers or doctors either in those days the holdup an image I might have aspired to
LAFB-671||all I really knew for certain was that a lawyer didn't wash dishes as I was doing
LAFB-672||mr. ostrowski looks surprised I remember and leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head
LAFB-673||it kind of has smiled and said Malcolm one of life's first needs is for us to be realistic
LAFB-674||don't misunderstand me now we all hear like
LAFB-675||do you know that but you got to be realistic about being a Niger
LAFB-676||a lawyer that's no realistic goal for a Niger
LAFB-677||you need to think about something you can be
LAFB-678||you're good with your hands making things everybody admires your carpentry shop work why don't you plan on carpentry people like you as a person you get all kinds of work
LAFB-679||the more I thought afterwards about what he said The more uneasy it made me it just kept reading around in my mind
LAFB-680||what made it really begin to disturb me was mr. ostrowski advice to others in my class all of them white
LAFB-681||most of them had told him they were planning to become farmers
LAFB-682||but those who wanted to strike out on their own to try something new he had encouraged some mostly girls wanted to be teachers
LAFB-684||it was a surprising thing that I had never thought of it that way before but I realize that whatever I wasn't I was smarter than nearly all of those white kids
LAFB-685||but apparently I was still not intelligent enough in their eyes to become whatever I wanted to be
LAFB-686||it was then that I began to change
LAFB-687||inside I drew away from white people I came to class and I answered when called upon it became a physical strain simply to sit in mr. ostrosky class
LAFB-688||where Niger had slipped off my back before wherever I heard it now I stopped
LAFB-689||and look at whoever said it and they look surprised that I did
LAFB-690||I quit hearing so much Niger and what's wrong which was the way I wanted
LAFB-691||nobody including the teachers could decide what it come over me I knew I was being discussed
LAFB-692||in a few more weeks it was that way to at the restaurant where I work washing dishes and that the swirling
LAFB-693||one day soon after mrs. swirling called me into the living room and there was the state Man Maynard Allen
LAFB-694||I knew from their faces that something was about to happen
LAFB-695||she told me that none of them could understand why after I have done so well in school and on my job and living with them and after everyone in Mason had come to like me
LAFB-696||I had lately begun to make them all feel that I wasn't happy there anymore
LAFB-697||she said she felt it was no need for me to stay at the detention home any longer and that Arrangements
LAFB-698||made for me to go and live with the Lyons Family who liked me so much
LAFB-699||she stood up and put out her hand I guess I've asked you a hundred times Malcolm do you want to tell me what's wrong
LAFB-700||I shook her hand and said nothing this is swirling
LAFB-701||then I went and got my things and came back down
LAFB-702||at the living room door I saw her wiping her eyes I felt very bad
LAFB-703||I thanked her and went out in front to mr. Allen who took me over to the Lions is
LAFB-704||mr. and mrs. Lyons and their children during the two months I live with them while finishing the eighth grade also tried to get me to tell them what was wrong but somehow I couldn't tell them either
LAFB-705||I went every Saturday to see my brothers and sisters in Lansing and almost every other day I wrote to Ella in Boston
LAFB-706||not saying why I told Ella that I wanted to come there and live
LAFB-707||I don't know how she did it but she arranged for a
LAFB-708||custody of me to be transferred from Michigan to Massachusetts and the very weak I finished the eighth grade I again boarded the Greyhound bus ft Boston
LAFB-709||I thought about that time a lot since then no physical move in my life has been more pivotal or profound and its repercussions
LAFB-710||if I had stayed on in Michigan I would probably have married one of those negro girls I knew and liked in Lansing
LAFB-711||I might have become one of those State Capitol building shoeshine boys or Lansing Country Club waiter or gotten one of the other menial jobs which in those days a month Lansing Negroes would have been considered successful
LAFB-712||even become a carpenter whatever I have done since then I have driven myself
LAFB-713||to become a success at it I've often thought that if Mr ostrowski had encouraged me to become a lawyer
LAFB-715||all Praises due to Allah that I went to Boston when I did
LAFB-716||if I hadn't I'd probably still be a brainwashed black Christian
LAFB-717||chapter 3 home boy I looked like Li'l Abner Mason Michigan was written all over me
LAFB-718||my kinky reddish hair was cut his style and I didn't even use grease in it
LAFB-719||my green suits coat sleeve stopped above my wrists the pants leg showed 3in of socks
LAFB-720||just a shade lighter green than the suit was my narrow collared three-quarter-length Lansing department store top coat
LAFB-721||my appearance was too much for even Ella
LAFB-722||but she told me later she had seen countrified members of The Little Family come up from Georgia and even worse shape than I was
LAFB-723||Ella had fix up a nice little upstairs room for me
LAFB-724||and she was truly a Georgia negro woman when she got into the kitchen with her pots and pans
LAFB-725||give me the kind of cook who would keep up your plate with such as ham hock greens black-eyed peas fried fish cabbage sweet potatoes grits and gravy and corn bread
LAFB-726||in the more you put away the better she felt
LAFB-727||I worked out at Ella's kitchen table like there was no tomorrow
LAFB-728||Ella still seem to be as big black outspoken and impressive a woman as she had been in Mason and Lansing
LAFB-729||only about two weeks before I arrived she could split up with her second husband the soldier Frank whom I had met the previous summer
LAFB-730||but she was taking it right in stride
LAFB-731||I could see you though I didn't say how any average man would find it almost impossible to live for very long with a woman whose every Instinct was to run everything and everybody she had anything to do with including me
LAFB-732||about my second day they're in Roxbury Ella told me that you didn't want me to start hunting for a job right away like most newcomer Negroes did
LAFB-734||thing about the city they were living in Ella said she'd help me find a job when it was time for me to go to work
LAFB-735||so I went walking around the neighborhood the Wambach and Humboldt Avenue Hill section of Roxbury which is something like Harlem Sugar Hill where I later live
LAFB-736||I saw those Roxbury Negroes acting and living differently from any black people I've ever dreamed of in my life
LAFB-737||this was the snooty black neighborhood they called themselves the 408 down their noses at the Negroes of the black ghetto or so-called Town section where Mary my other half sister live
LAFB-739||I know now of course that what I was really seeing was only a big city version of those successful negro bootblacks and janitors back in Lansing
LAFB-740||the only difference was that the ones in Boston have been brainwashed even more thoroughly
LAFB-741||they prided themselves on being incomparably more cultured cultivated dignified and better off than their black brother and down in the ghetto which was no further away than you could throw a rock
LAFB-742||under the pitiful misapprehension that it would make them better these Hill Negroes were breaking their backs trying to imitate white people
LAFB-743||any black family that had been around Boston long enough to own the home they lived in was considered among the Hill Elite
LAFB-744||it didn't make any difference that they had to rent out rooms to make ends meet
LAFB-745||Ben the native-born new englanders among them look down upon recently migrated Southern homeowners who lived next door like Ella
LAFB-746||and a big percentage of the Hill dwellers were in Ella's category Southern Strivers and scramblers and West Indian Negroes home both the new englanders and the southerners called black Jews
LAFB-747||usually it was the southerners in the west Indians who not only managed to own the places where they lived but also at least one other house which they rent it is income property
LAFB-748||the snooty new englanders usually own less than that
LAFB-749||in those days on the hill any who Proclaim professional status teachers preachers practical nurses also considered themselves Superior
LAFB-750||foreign diplomats could have modeled their conduct on the way negro Postman Pullman Porters and dining car waiters of Roxbury acted striding around as if they were wearing top hats and cutaways
LAFB-751||I guess that eight out of ten of the Hill Negroes of Roxbury despite the impressive-sounding job titles they affected
LAFB-752||actually worked as menials and servants he's in banking or he's in
LAFB-753||Carrie's it sounded as though they were discussing a Rockefeller or a melon and not some gray-headed dignity posturing Bank janitor or bondhouse messenger
LAFB-754||I was an old family was the euphemism used to dignify the professions of white folks cooks and Maids who talked so effectively among their own kind in Roxbury that you couldn't even understand
LAFB-755||I don't know how many 40 and 50 year-old errand boys went down the hill dressed like ambassador's in black suits and white collars to downtown jobs in government in finance or in law
LAFB-756||it has never cease to amaze me how so many Negroes then and now could stand the indignity of that kind of self-delusion
LAFB-757||soon I rained out of Roxbury and began to explore Boston Proper
LAFB-758||historic buildings everywhere I turned and plaques and markers and statues for famous events in men
LAFB-759||one statue in the Boston Commons astonished me
LAFB-760||a negro named Crispus Attucks who had been the first man to fall in the Boston Massacre I had never known anything like that
LAFB-761||I roamed everywhere in One Direction I walked as far as Boston University another day I took my first subway ride
LAFB-762||when most of the people got off I followed it was Cambridge and I circled all around in the Harvard University campus
LAFB-763||somewhere I had already heard of Harvard though I didn't know much more about it
LAFB-764||nobody that they could have told me I would give an address before the Harvard Law School Forum some twenty years later
LAFB-765||I also did a lot of exploring downtown why a city would have two Big Railroad stations North Station and South Station I couldn't understand
LAFB-766||at both of the station's I stood around and watched people arrive and leave and I did the same thing at the bus station where Ella had met me
LAFB-767||my wanderings even let me down along the piers and docks where I read plaques telling about the old sailing ships that used to put into Port there
LAFB-768||in a letter to Wilfred Hilda filbert and Reginald back in Lansing
LAFB-769||I told them about all of this at about the winding narrow cobblestone streets and the houses that jammed up against each other
LAFB-770||downtown Boston I wrote them had the biggest stores I'd ever seen and white people's restaurants and hotels I made up my mind that I was going to see every movie that came to the Fine air-conditioned theaters
LAFB-771||on Massachusetts Avenue next door to one of them the Lowes State Theater was the huge exciting Roseland State Ballroom big posters out front advertised the nationally famous bands white and negro that had play they're coming next week
LAFB-772||when I went that first time was Glenn Miller hi remember thinking how Dilly the whole evenings music and Mason High School dances had been Glenn Miller's
LAFB-773||Kurds what wouldn't that crowd have given I wanted to be standing where Glenn Miller's band was actually going to play
LAFB-774||I didn't know how familiar with Roseland I was going to become
LAFB-775||Ella began to grow concerned because even when I had finally had enough sightseeing I didn't stick around very much on the hill
LAFB-777||play it always looked up to me as if I were considerably older
LAFB-778||are weekends back in Lansing where I go to get away from the white people in Mason I'd hung around in the Negro part of town with Wilfred and Phil Bridge set
LAFB-779||though all of them were several years older than me I was bigger and I actually look
LAFB-780||older than most of them I didn't want to disappoint or upset Ella but despite her advice I began going down into the town ghetto section
LAFB-781||that world of grocery stores walk-up Flats cheap restaurants poolrooms bars storefront churches in pawn shops seem to hold a natural lower for me
LAFB-782||Not only was this part of Roxbury more exciting but I felt more relaxed among Negroes were being their natural selves and not putting on airs
LAFB-783||even though I did live on the hill my instincts were never and still aren't to feel myself better than any other negro
LAFB-784||I spent the first month in town with my mouth hanging open
LAFB-786||Ella told me this was called a conch
LAFB-787||I never tasted a sip of liquor never even smoke the cigarette
LAFB-788||and here I saw a little black children 10 and 12 years-old shooting craps playing cards fighting getting grown-ups to put a penny or a nickel on that number for them things like that
LAFB-789||and these children through around swear words I've never heard before even and slang Expressions that would just as new to me such a stud and cat and chicken pool and hip
LAFB-790||every night as I lay in bed I turn these new words over in my mind
LAFB-792||I wanted to find a job myself to surprise
LAFB-793||one afternoon something told me to go inside a pool room whose window I was looking through I had looked through that window many times I wasn't yearning to play pool in fact I never held a cue stick
LAFB-794||but I was drawn by the sight of the cool looking cat standing around inside bending over the Big Green felt top tables making bets and shooting the bright colored balls into the holes
LAFB-795||as I stared through the window this particular afternoon something made me decide to venture inside and talk to a dark study conk headed fellow who racked up ball for the pool players who might herd called shorty
LAFB-796||one day he'd come outside and see me standing there and said hi red so
LAFB-797||that made me figure he was friendly as inconspicuously as I could I slipped inside the door and around the side of the pool room avoiding people and onto the back where shorty was filling an aluminum can with the powder that pool players dust on their hands
LAFB-799||later on Shorty would enjoy teasing me about how weird that first glance he knew my whole story
LAFB-800||man that cat still smelled country he'd say laughing cats legs was so long and his pants so short uni shows and his head look like a Briar Patch
LAFB-801||but that afternoon shorty didn't let it show in his face How Country I appeared when I told him I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me how could somebody go about getting a job like his
LAFB-802||if you mean racking up balls said shorty I don't know of no pool joints around here needing anybody you mean you just want any slave you can find a slave meant work a job
LAFB-803||yes what kind of work I had done I told him that I'd washed restaurant dishes in Mason Michigan he nearly dropped the powder can my homeboy man give me some skin come from Lansing
LAFB-804||I never told shorty and he never suspected that he was about to
LAFB-805||he is older than I he took us to be about the same age at first I would have been embarrassed to tell him later I just never bothered
LAFB-806||shorty had dropped out of first-year high school in Lansing lived while with an uncle and Aunt in Detroit and had spent the last six years living with his cousin in Roxbury
LAFB-807||but when I mention the name of Lansing people in places he remembered many and pretty soon we sounded as if we have been raised in the same block
LAFB-808||I could sense Shorty's genuine gladness and I don't have to say how lucky I felt to find a friend as hip as he obviously was
LAFB-809||man this is a swinging town if you dig it shorty said you my homeboy I'm going to school you to the happenings I still Darren grin like a fool you got to go anywhere now we'll stick around till I get off
LAFB-810||one thing I immediately liked about shorty was his frankness what I told him where I live he said what I already knew that nobody in town could stand the hill Negroes but
LAFB-811||I thought a sister who gave me a pad not charging me rent not even running me out to find some slave couldn't be all bad
LAFB-812||shorty slave in the pool room he said was just to keep ends together while he learned his horn
LAFB-813||a couple of years before he hit the numbers and bought a saxophone got it right in there in the closet now for my lesson tonight
LAFB-814||shorty was taking lessons with some other studs and he intended to 1-day organize his own small band
LAFB-815||there's a lot of bread to be made digging right around here in Roxbury shorty explained to me
LAFB-816||I don't think joining some big band one night and all over just to say I played with count laduca somebody
LAFB-817||I thought that was smart I wished I had studied a horn
LAFB-818||but I never had been exposed to 1 all afternoon between trips upfront to Rack balls shorty talk to me out of the corner of his mouth Which Hustler standing around or playing at this or that table sold
LAFB-819||had just come out of prison or were second-story man
LAFB-820||shorty told me that he played at least a dollar day on the numbers he said as soon as he hit a number he would use the winnings to organize his band
LAFB-821||I was ashamed to have to admit that I have never played the numbers well you ain't never had none to play with you said excusing me but you start when you get a slave and if you hit
LAFB-822||you got to take the something he pointed out some gamblers and some pimps some of them had white whores he whispered
LAFB-823||I ain't going to lie I dig them $2 White Chicks shorty said there's a lot of that action around here Nike you see it
LAFB-824||I said I had already seen some you ever had one he asked
LAFB-825||my embarrassment at my inexperience showed
LAFB-826||tell Manny said don't be ashamed I had a few before I left Lansing them polite chick that used to come over the bridge here that mostly Italians and Irish but it don't matter what kind
LAFB-827||something else ain't no difference nowhere there's nothing they love better than a black stud
LAFB-828||through the afternoon shorty introduce me to players in lounges my homeboy he'd say he's looking for a slave if you hear anything
LAFB-829||they all said they'd look out at 7 when the night ball record came on shorty told me he had to hurry to his saxophone lesson but before he left he held out to me the six or seven dollars he had collected that day and nickel-and-dime tips you got enough bread homeboy
LAFB-830||I was okay I told him I had $2 but shorty made me take three more then fattening for your pocket you said
LAFB-831||before we went out you open the saxophone case and showed me the horn
LAFB-832||it was gleaming brass against the green velvet and alto sax he said he cool homeboy and come back to borrow some of the cats return you up a Slave
LAFB-833||when I got home Ella said there had been a telephone call from somebody named shorty
LAFB-834||he had left a message that over at the Roseland
LAFB-835||Ballroom the shoe shine boy was quitting that night and shorty had told him to hold the job for me
LAFB-836||Malcolm you haven't had any experience shining shoes Ella said
LAFB-837||are expression and tone of voice told me she wasn't happy about by taking that job
LAFB-838||I didn't particularly care because I was already speechless thinking about being somewhere close to the greatest band in the world
LAFB-839||I didn't even wait to eat any dinner the ballroom was all lighted when I got there a man at the front door was letting in members of Benny Goodman's band I told him I wanted to see the shoe shine boy Freddy
LAFB-840||you going to be the new one he asked I said I thought I was and he left well maybe you'll hit the numbers and get a Cadillac to
LAFB-841||you told me that I find Freddy upstairs in the men's room on the second floor
LAFB-842||but downstairs before I went up I stepped over and snatched the Glimpse inside the ballroom I just couldn't believe the size of that waxed floor
LAFB-843||at the far end under the soft Rose colored lights was the Bandstand with the Benny Goodman musicians moving around laughing and talkin arranging their horns and stands
LAFB-844||a wiry brown-skinned conked fellow upstairs in the men's room greeted me
LAFB-845||you showed his homeboy I said I was and he said he was Freddy
LAFB-846||good old boy he said he called me he just heard I hit the big number and he figured right I'd be quitting
LAFB-847||I told Freddy what the man at the front door and said about the Cadillac he laughed and said burn them white cats up when you get yourself something yeah I told him I was going to get me one just to bug them
LAFB-848||pretty then said for me to pay close attention that he was going to be busy and for me to watch but not get in the way and he tried to get me ready to take over at the next dance a couple of nights later
LAFB-849||as Freddy busy themselves setting-up The shoeshine Stand he told
LAFB-850||get here early your shoe shine rags and brushes by this foot stand your polish bottles paste wax suede brushes over there everything in place you get rust you never need to waste motion
LAFB-851||while you shine shoes I learned you also kept watch on customers inside leaving the urinals
LAFB-852||you'd ought it over and offered a small white hand towel a lot of cat you ain't planning to wash their hands sometime you can run up with a towel and shame them your towels are really your best hustle in here cost you a penny apiece the laundry
LAFB-854||from down below the sound of the music begun floating up
LAFB-855||I guess I stood transfixed you never seen a big dance asked Freddy
LAFB-856||run on the Wild and watch there were a few couples already dancing under the rose colored lights but even more exciting to me was the crowds thronging in
LAFB-857||the most glamorous looking white women I'd ever seen young ones old ones white cats buying tickets at the window sticking big wads of green bills back into their pockets checking the woman's coats and taking their arms and Squire in them inside
LAFB-859||when things slow down a little he said you ain't seen nothing tonight you wait until you see your Spooks dance man
LAFB-860||I will people carry home whenever you had a
LAFB-861||he kept schooling me shoelaces this drawer here you just starting out I'm going to make these to you as a present
LAFB-862||buy them for Nicola pair tell the cats that they need laces if they do and charged to B
LAFB-863||every Benny Goodman record I've ever heard in my life it seemed was filtering finkley in to where we were
LAFB-864||during another customer low Freddy let me slip back outside again to listen
LAFB-865||Peggy Lee was at the mic singing Beautiful
LAFB-866||she had just joined the band and she was from North Dakota and had been singing with a group in Chicago when mrs. Benny Goodman discovered her we had heard some customers say
LAFB-867||she finished the song and the crowd burst into Applause she was a big hit
LAFB-868||knock me out to when I first broke in here Freddie said grinning when I got back in there but look you haven't signed any shoes he laughed when I said I hadn't accepting my own well let's get to work
LAFB-869||I never had either Freddy got on the stand and went to work on his own shoes brush liquid polish brush
LAFB-870||paste wax shine rag lacquer so dressing step-by-step Freddy showed me what to do
LAFB-872||by the end of the dance Freddy had Let Me Shine the shoes of three or four stray drunks he talked into having shines and I have practice picking up my speed on Freddy's shoes until they look like mirrors
LAFB-873||after we had helped the janitors to clean up the ballroom after the dance throwing out all the papers
LAFB-874||cigarette butts and empty liquor bottles Freddie was nice enough to drive me all the way home to Eva's on the hill in the second-hand maroon Buick he said he was going to trade it in on his Cadillac
LAFB-875||he talked to me all the way I guess it's all right to tell you pick up a couple of packs of rubbers to bits a piece you noticed some of those Catholic came up to me around the end of the dance well when some have a new chick on right they'll come asking you for rubbers charger Dollar General you'll get Nestor tip
LAFB-876||he looked across at me some hustles you're too new for
LAFB-877||Castle ask you for liquor summer want reefers
LAFB-878||but you don't need to have nothing except rubbers untilyou kindig who's a cop
LAFB-879||you can make 10 $12 a dance for yourself if you work everything right pretty said before I got out of the car in front of Alice the main thing you got to remember is that everything in the world is a hustle so long red
LAFB-880||the next time I ran into Freddy I was downtown one night a few weeks later
LAFB-881||he was parked in his Pearl gray Cadillac shop as attack Cooling
LAFB-882||man you sure schooled me I said and he laughed he knew what I meant
LAFB-883||it hadn't taken me long on the job to find out that Freddie had unless shoe-shining and towel hustling then selling liquor and reefers and putting white John's in touch with negro whores
LAFB-885||at the white dances of course nothing black was allowed and that's where the Blackhorse pimps soon showed a new shoe shine boy what he could pick up on the side by slipping a phone number or address to the
LAFB-886||John who came around the end of the dance looking for black chicks
LAFB-888||some of the band's man would come up to the men's room at about 8 and get shoe shines before they went to work
LAFB-889||Duke Ellington Count Basie Lionel Hampton cootie Williams Jimmie Lunceford were just a few of those who sat in my chair
LAFB-890||I would really make my shine rag sound like someone that said off Chinese firecrackers
LAFB-892||Hodges step down reaching his hand in his pocket to pay me but then snatched his hand out to gesture and just forgot me and walked away
LAFB-893||I wouldn't have dared to bother the man who could do what he did with Daydream by asking him for $0.15
LAFB-894||I remember that I struck up a little shoeshine stand conversation with Count Basie's great blues singer Jimmy rushing he's the one famous were sent for you yesterday here you come today and things like that
LAFB-895||rushing speak I remember we're big and funny shape not long like most big feet but they were round and
LAFB-896||Rollie Pollie like rushing anyhow he even introduced me to some of the other basic cats like Lester Young Harry Edison buddy Tate Don Byers Dickie Wells and buck Clayton
LAFB-898||I never got any decent tips until the middle of the Negro dances which is when the dancer started feeling good and getting generous
LAFB-900||during Lowe's up there in the men's room sometimes I get in 5 minutes of watching the dancing
LAFB-902||times have truly changed if it happened today those same black girls would go after those negro men and the white women too
LAFB-903||anyways some couples were so abandoned slinging high and wide improvising steps and movement that you couldn't believe it I could feel the beat in my bones even though I had never
LAFB-904||Showtime
LAFB-907||sometimes I would be down there standing it inside the door jumping up and down in my gray jacket with the whisk broom in the pocket and the manager would have to come and Shout at me that I had customers upstairs
LAFB-909||Shorty's jokes about how country I had been made us all laugh I still was country I know now
LAFB-910||but it all felt so great because I was accepted
LAFB-911||all of us would be in somebody's Place usually one of the girls and we be turning on the reefers making everybody's headlight or the whiskey a glow in our middles everybody understood that my head had to stay kinky a while longer to grow long enough for shorty to Concord for me
LAFB-912||one of these nights I remark that I had saved about half enough to get a Zoot
LAFB-913||save shorty couldn't believe it homeboy you never heard of credit
LAFB-914||he told me he called the neighborhood clothing store the first thing in the morning and that I should be there early
LAFB-917||as a gift the salesman said the store would give me a narrow leather belt with my initial L on it then he said I also buy a hat and I did blue
LAFB-918||with a feather in the 4-inch brim then the store gave me another present a long thick Link gold plated chain that swung down lower than my coat him I was sold Forever on credit
LAFB-919||when I modeled the Zoot for Ella she took a long look and said well I guess it had to happen
LAFB-921||one picture I autographed and are mailed to my brothers and sisters in Lansing and let them see how well I was doing I gave another one to Ella and the third to shorty who was really moved I can tell by the way he said thanks homeboy
LAFB-922||it was part of our hip cold not to show that kind of affection
LAFB-923||shorty soon decided that my hair was finally long enough to be caught
LAFB-924||get promise to school me and how to beat the barbershop 3 and $4 price by making a Conga lean and then conking ourselves
LAFB-926||shorty paid $6 a week for a room in his cousin shabby apartment his cousin wasn't home it's like the pads mine he spends so much time with his woman surely said now you watch me
LAFB-927||you peel the potatoes and thin slice them into a quart-size Mason fruit
LAFB-928||then started stirring them with a wooden spoon as he gradually poured in a little over half the can of lie ever use a metal spoon the libel turn is black he told me
LAFB-929||a jelly-like starchy looking blop resulted from the lion potatoes and shorty broke into two eggs during real fast his own conch and dark face bent down clothes
LAFB-930||the conga lean turn pale yellowish
LAFB-931||feel the job shorty said I cut my hand against the outside and snatched it away
LAFB-932||damn right is hot that's the LIE he said so you know it's going to burn when I comb it and it burns bad but the longer you can stand at the straight of the hair
LAFB-934||anywhere you feel any little stinging shorty warned me washing his hands then pulling on the rubber gloves and tying on his own rubber apron you always got to remember that any kind of lean left in Burns a saw into your head
LAFB-935||the conga lean just don't warm when shorty started combing it in
LAFB-937||call out okay the flame came back and shorty with a thick towels started drying my head rubbing hard easy man easy I kept shouting the first time's always the worst you get used to it better before long you took it real good homeboy you got a good come
LAFB-938||when shorty let me stand up and see in the mirror my hair hung down and Limp damp strings
LAFB-939||my Scouts do flamed but not as badly I could bear it
LAFB-940||he tripped the towel around my shoulders over my rubber apron and began again Vaseline in my hair
LAFB-941||I can feel them coming straight back first a big comb then the fine-tooth one then he was using a razor very delicately on the back of my neck then finally shaping the sideburns
LAFB-942||my first view in the mirror block it out to hurting I've seen some pretty conchs but when it's the first time on your own ads the transformation after a lifetime of Kinks is staggering
LAFB-943||the mirror reflective shorty behind me
LAFB-944||both were grinning and sweating and on top of my head was this thick smooth Sheen of shining red hair real red as straight as any white man
LAFB-945||how ridiculous I was stupid enough to stand that simply lost in admiration of my hair now looking white reflected in the mirror and Shorty's room
LAFB-946||I bought I'd never again be without a conch and I never was for many years
LAFB-947||this was my first really big step forward self-degradation
LAFB-948||what I am doing all of that pain literally burning my flesh to have it look like a white man's hair
LAFB-949||I had joined that multitude of negro men and women in America who are brainwashed into believing that the black people are inferior and white people Superior that they will even violate and mutilate that God created bodies to try and look pretty by white standards
LAFB-950||look around today and every small town in big-city from two-bit catfish
LAFB-951||Sodapop joint into the integrated lobby of the Waldorf Astoria and you'll see conks on black men
LAFB-952||and you'll see black women wearing these green and pink and purple and red and platinum blonde wigs
LAFB-953||they're all more ridiculous than a slapstick comedy
LAFB-954||it makes you wonder if the Negro has completely lost his sense of identity lost touch with himself
LAFB-955||you'll see the Conch worn by many many so-called upper-class Negroes and as much as I hate to say it about them on all too many negro entertainers
LAFB-956||one of the reasons that I've especially admired some of them like Lionel Hampton Inn Sidney Poitier among others is that they have kept their natural hair and fought to the top
LAFB-957||I admire any negro man who has never had himself conked or who has had the sense to get rid of it as I finally did
LAFB-958||I don't know which kind of self-defence in conquers the greater shame
LAFB-959||the one you'll see on the heads of the black so-called middle-class and upper-class who ought to know better
LAFB-960||or the one you see on the heads of the poorest most downtrodden ignorant black man
LAFB-961||I mean the legal minimum wage ghetto dwelling kind of negro as I was when I got my first one
LAFB-962||it's generally among these poor fools that you'll see a black kerchief over the man's head like Aunt Jemima
LAFB-963||he's trying to make his cock last longer between trips to the barbershop
LAFB-964||only for special occasions is this church of protected conk exposed to show off how sharpened hip its owner is
LAFB-965||the ironic thing is that I have never heard any woman white or black express any admiration for a conch
LAFB-966||of course any white woman with a black man isn't thinking about his hair
LAFB-967||but I don't see how on Earth a black woman with any race Pride could walk down the street with any black man wearing a conch the emblem of his shame that he is black
LAFB-970||that paragraph is deliberate of course it's just to display a bit more of the slang that was used by everyone I respected his hip in those days and in no time at all I was talkin to slang
LAFB-973||with alcohol or marijuana lightning my head and that wild music wailing way on those portable record players it didn't take long to loosen up the dancing instincts in my African heritage
LAFB-974||all I remember is that during some party around this time when nearly everyone but me was up dancing some girl grab me they often would take the initiative and grab a partner for no girl at these parties whatever dream that anyone present couldn't dance and there I was out on the floor
LAFB-975||I was up in the Jocelyn crowd and suddenly unexpectedly I got the idea it was as though somebody had click on the light
LAFB-976||my long-suppressed African Instinct broke through and loose
LAFB-977||having spent so much time and Mason's white environment I had believed and feared the dancing involved a certain order or pattern of specific steps as dancing is done by whites
LAFB-978||but here among my own less inhibited people I discovered it was simply letting your feet Hands and Body spontaneously act out whatever impulses were stirred by the music
LAFB-979||prambanan hardly a party took place without me turning up inviting myself if I had to and
LAFB-980||Andy hopping my head off at always been faster picking up new things I made up for lost time now so fast that soon girls were asking me to dance with them I work my partner's hard that's why they like me so much
LAFB-981||when I was at work up in the Roseland men's room I just couldn't keep still
LAFB-982||my Shine rap pop with the rhythm of those great bands rocking the ballroom
LAFB-983||white customers on the shine stand especially with laugh to see my feet suddenly break loose on their own and cut a few steps
LAFB-984||whites are correct in thinking that black people are natural dances even little kids are except those Negroes today who are so integrated as I had been that their instincts are inhibited
LAFB-985||you know those dancing jigaboo toys that you'll wind up while I was like a live one music just wound me up
LAFB-986||by the next dance for the Boston Black Folk I remember the Lionel Hampton was coming into play
LAFB-987||I had given my notice to the roselands manager
LAFB-988||when I told Ella wide quit she laughed loud
LAFB-989||I told her I couldn't find time to shine shoes and dance to
LAFB-990||she was glad because she had never liked the idea of my working at that no Prestige job
LAFB-991||when I told shorty he said he'd known I'd soon outgrow it anyway
LAFB-992||Trudy could dance all right himself but for his own reasons he never cared about going to the big dances
LAFB-993||he loved just the music making end of it he practiced his saxophone and listen to records it astonished me that shorty didn't care to go and hear the big bands play
LAFB-994||he had his alto sax Idol Johnny Hodges with Duke Ellington's band
LAFB-995||but he said he thought too many young musicians were only carbon copying the big band names on the same instrument
LAFB-996||anyway shorty was really serious about nothing except his music and about working for the day when he could start his own little group to Gig around boss
LAFB-997||the morning after I quit Roseland I was down at the men's clothing store Brighton early
LAFB-998||the salesman checked and found that I'd missed only one weekly payment I had a one crab
LAFB-999||I told him I just quit my job but he said that didn't make any difference I could miss paying them a couple of weeks if I had to he knew I'd get straight
LAFB-1000||this time I studied carefully everything in my size on the racks
LAFB-1001||and I finally picked out my second Zoot it was a shark skin gray with a big long coat and pants ballooning out at the knees and then tapering down to cuffs so narrow that I had to take off my shoes to get them on and off
LAFB-1002||with the salesman urging me on I got another shirt and a hat and new shoes the kind that would just coming into hipster style dark orange colored with paper-thin soles and knob style toes
LAFB-1003||it all added up to seventy or eighty dollars
LAFB-1004||it was such a red-letter day that I even went and got my first Barbershop, this time it didn't hurt so much just a shorty had predicted
LAFB-1005||that night I timed myself to hit Roseland as the thick of the crowd was coming in in the thronging lobby I saw some of the real Roxbury hipsters in meizu and some fine women were giving me that look
LAFB-1006||I sorted up the men's room for a short drink from the Pint inside my coat pocket
LAFB-1007||my replacement was there a scared narrow faced hungry looking little brown-skinned fellow just in town from Kansas City
LAFB-1008||and when he recognized me he couldn't keep down his admiration in wonder I told him to keep cool that he'd soon catch on to the happenings
LAFB-1009||everything felt right when I went into the ballroom
LAFB-1010||Champs band was working and that big waxed floor was packed with people Lindy hopping like crazy
LAFB-1011||I grabbed some girl I'd never seen and the next thing I knew we were out there Linda being away and grinning at each other it couldn't have been fine
LAFB-1012||I've been Lindy and previously only in cramped little apartment living rooms and now I had room to maneuver
LAFB-1013||once I really got myself warmed and loosened up I was snatching partner's from among the hundreds of unattached freelancing girls along the sideline almost every one of them could really dance and I just about went wild
LAFB-1014||pimps band Wailin I was whirling girls so fast there's skirts was snapping black girls Brown skins high yellow even a couple of white girls that boosting them over my hips my shoulders into the air
LAFB-1015||no I wasn't quite sixteen then I was tall and rawbone and look like 21 I was also pretty strong for my age circling tap-dancing
LAFB-1016||I was underneath them when they landed doing the flapping Eagle the kangaroo and the split
LAFB-1017||after that I never missed a Roseland Lindy Hop as long as I stayed in Boston
LAFB-1018||the greatest Linda dancing partner I had everything considered with a girl named Laura
LAFB-1019||I met her at my next job when I quit you shining Ella was so happy that you went around asking about a job for me one she would approve
LAFB-1020||just two blocks from her house the Townsend drug store was about to replace it soda fountain clerk a fella who is leaving to go off to college
LAFB-1022||every evening when I got off at 8 and came home Ella kept saying I hope you'll meet some of those nice young people your age here in Roxbury
LAFB-1023||but those Penny any squares who came in they're putting on their millionaires airs the young ones in the old ones both only annoyed me
LAFB-1025||even the young ones my age who Ella was always talkin about the soda fountain was one of their Hangouts they soon had me ready to quit with their accent so phone it up that if you just heard them and didn't see them you wouldn't even know they were Negroes
LAFB-1026||I couldn't wait for 8 to get home to eat out of those soul food pots of Ella's then get dressed in my
LAFB-1027||Zoot and head for some of my friends places in town to Lindy Hop and get high or something for relief from those Hill clowns
LAFB-1028||before long I didn't see how I was going to be able to stick it out there 8 hours a day and I nearly didn't
LAFB-1029||I remember one night I nearly quit because I had hit the numbers for $0.10 the first time I had ever hit on one of the sidelines best that I had made in the drugstore yes there were several Runners on the hill even dignified Negroes play the numbers
LAFB-1030||I won $60 and shorty and I had a ball with
LAFB-1031||I wished I had hit for the Daily Dollar that I played with my town man paying it by the week I surely would have quit the drugstore I could have bought a car
LAFB-1032||anyway Laura lived in a house that was caddy corner across the street from the drugstore
LAFB-1033||afterwhile as soon as I saw her coming in I'd start making up a banana split she was a real bug for them and she came in late every afternoon after school
LAFB-1034||I imagine I've been shoving that ice cream discharge under her nose for five or six weeks before somehow it began to sink in that she wasn't like the rest
LAFB-1035||she certainly was the only Hill girl that came in there and acted in any way friendlier natural
LAFB-1036||she always had some book with her and pouring over it she would make a 30-minute job of that Daily Dish of banana split
LAFB-1037||I began to notice the book she read they were pretty heavy school stuff Latin algebra things like that
LAFB-1038||watching her made me reflect that I hadn't read even a newspaper since leaving Mason
LAFB-1039||Laura I heard her name called by a few of the others who came in when she was there but I could see they didn't know her too well they said hello that was about the extent of it she kept to herself and she never said more than thank you to me
LAFB-1040||nice voice soft quiet
LAFB-1041||never another word but no heirs like the others no black Boston he's she was just her cell
LAFB-1043||before too long I struck up a conversation
LAFB-1044||just what subject I got off on I don't remember but she readily opened up and began talkin and she was very friendly
LAFB-1045||I found out that she was a High School Junior and honor student her parents split up when she was a baby and she had been raised by her grandmother and old lady on a pension who was very strict and old-fashioned than religious
LAFB-1046||Moorhead just one close friend the girl who lived over in Cambridge who she had gone to school with they talked on the telephone everyday her grandmother's scarcely ever let her go to the movies let alone on dates
LAFB-1047||but Laura really like school she said she wanted to go on to college
LAFB-1048||she was Keen for algebra and she plan to major in science Laura never would have dreamed that she was a year older than I was I gauge that indirectly she looked up to me is though she felt I had a world of experience
LAFB-1049||more than she did which really was the truth but sometimes when she had gone I felt let down thinking how I had turned away from the books I used to like when I was back in Michigan
LAFB-1050||I got to the point where I look forward to her coming in every day after school
LAFB-1051||I stopped letting her pee and gave her extra ice cream and she wasn't hiding the fact that she liked me
LAFB-1052||it wasn't long before she get stopped reading her books when she came in and we're just sitting eat and talk with me and soon she began trying to get me to talk about myself
LAFB-1053||I was immediately sorry when I dropped that I had once thought about becoming a lawyer
LAFB-1054||she didn't want to let me rest about that Malcolm there's no reason you can't pick up right up where you are and become a lawyer
LAFB-1055||she had the idea that my sister Ella would help me as much as she could and if Ella had ever thought that she could help any member of the little family put up any kind of professional shingles as a teacher a foot doctor anyting why you would have had the tie her
LAFB-1056||sounds to keep her from taking in washing I never mentioned Laura to shorty
LAFB-1057||I just knew she would never have understood him or that crowd and they wouldn't have understood her she had never been touched I'm certain she hadn't or even had a drink and she wouldn't even have known what a reefer was
LAFB-1058||it was a great surprise to me when one afternoon Laura happen to let drop that she just loved Lindy Hop
LAFB-1059||I asked her how she had been able to go out dancing she said she been introduced a lily hopping at a party given by the parents of some negro friend just accepted by Harvard
LAFB-1060||it was just about time to start closing down the soda fountain and I said The Count Basie was playing the Roseland at weekends and would she like to go
LAFB-1061||Laura's I've got wide I thought I'd have to catch her she was so excited she said she'd never been there she heard so much about it she'd imagined
LAFB-1062||it was like she just give Anythink but her grandma would have a fit
LAFB-1063||so I said maybe some of the time but the afternoon before the dance Laura came in full of excitement she whispered that she never lied to her grandmother before but she had told her she had to attend some school function that evening
LAFB-1064||if I get her home early she'd meet me if I'd still take her
LAFB-1066||I laughed to myself a long time afterward about how Ella's mouth flew open when we showed up at the front door me and a well-bred hill girl
LAFB-1067||Laura when I introduced her was warm and sincere and Ella you would have thought she was close
LAFB-1068||sing it on her third husband while they sat and talked downstairs I dressed upstairs in my room
LAFB-1069||I remember changing my mind about the wild sharkskin gray suit I had planned to wear and deciding instead to put on the first one I've gotten the blue Zoot I knew I should wear the most conservative thing I had
LAFB-1070||they were like old friends when I came back down
LAFB-1071||Ella had even made T Ella's Hawkeye I just about wrecked my Zoup off my back but I'm sure she was grateful that I had at least put on the blue one
LAFB-1072||knowing Ella I knew that she had already extracted Laura's entire life story and all but had the Wedding Bells around my neck
LAFB-1073||I grinned all the way to the Roseland in the taxi because I had show Della I could hang out with he'll girls if I wanted to
LAFB-1074||Moore's eyes was so big she said almost none of her acquaintances knew her
LAFB-1075||grandmother who never went anywhere but the church so there wasn't much danger of it getting back to her the only person she had told was her girlfriend who would shared her excitement
LAFB-1076||then suddenly we were in the roseland's jostling Lobby and I was getting waves and smiles and greetings they shouted my man and hey red and I answered Daddio
LAFB-1077||she and I had never before dance together but that's certainly was no problem any two people who can lend it all can Linda together we just started out there on the floor among a lot of other couples
LAFB-1078||it was maybe halfway in the number before I became aware of how she dance
LAFB-1079||if you've ever Linda hopped you'll know what I'm talkin about
LAFB-1080||with most girls you kind of work opposite them circling sidestepping leading whichever on you lead with us half bent out there your hands are giving that little pull that little push touching her waste her shoulders her
LAFB-1081||arms she's in out turning whirling wherever you got her
LAFB-1083||I'd dance with plenty of good partners but what I became suddenly aware of with Laura was that I'd never before felt so little weight
LAFB-1084||I'd nearly just think of maneuver and she respond
LAFB-1085||anyway as she danced up-down under my arm flinging out while I felt her out and examined her style I glimpsed her footwork
LAFB-1086||I can close my eyes right now and see it like some blurring ballet beautiful
LAFB-1087||and her lightness like a shadow
LAFB-1088||my perfect partner if somebody had asked me
LAFB-1089||I've been one who handled as lightly as Laura and who would have had the strength to last through a long tough Showtime but I knew that Laura wouldn't begin to be that strong
LAFB-1090||in Harlem years later a friend of mine called Sammy the pimp taught me something I wish I had known then to look for in Laura's face
LAFB-1091||it was what Sammy declared as his infallible clue for determining the unconscious true personality of women
LAFB-1092||considering all the women he had picked out of crowds and turned into prostitutes Sammy qualified as an expert
LAFB-1093||anyway he swore that if a woman any woman gets really carried away while dancing what she truly is at least the potentially will surface and show on her face
LAFB-1094||I'm not suggesting that a lady of easy virtue look dance to the surface and Laura although like the deal her cruel blow starting with meeting me
LAFB-1095||all I am saying is that it may be that if I had been equipped with Sammy's Abby
LAFB-1096||I might have spotted in Laura then some of the subsurface potential destined to become real that would have shocked her grandma
LAFB-1099||now Count Basie turned on the showtime blast and the other dancers moved off the floor shifting for good washing positions and began their hollering for their favorites all right now red they say
LAFB-1100||how did to me go get them red and then a freelancing Linda girl I danced with before made me bevels a waitress and a wild dancer ran up to me with Laura standing right there
LAFB-1101||I wasn't sure what to do but Laura started backing away toward the crowd still looking at me
LAFB-1102||the counts band was wailing I grabbed the Mamie and we started to work she was a big rough strong Galaxy Lindy like a bucking horse
LAFB-1103||I remember the very night that she became known as one of the showtime favorites there at the Roseland
LAFB-1105||crowd loved anyway out Lindy and style that made a colorful show like that it was how Mamie had be
LAFB-1106||no anyway I started driving her like a horse the way she like
LAFB-1107||when we came off the floor after the first number we both were wringing wet with sweat and people with shouting and pounding our backs
LAFB-1108||I remember leaving early with Laura to get her home in time she was very quiet she didn't have much to say for the next week or so when she came into the drugstore
LAFB-1109||even then I had learned enough about women to know not to pressure them when they're thinking something out they'll tell you when they're ready
LAFB-1110||every time I saw Ella even brushing my teeth in the morning she turned on the third degree when was I seeing Laura again was I going to bring her by again what a nice girl she is Ella had picked her out for me
LAFB-1111||but in that kind of way I hardly thought anything about the girl
LAFB-1112||when it came to personal matters my mind was strictly on getting sharp in myzuka soon as I left work and racing downtown to hang out
LAFB-1113||shorty and the other guys and with the girls they knew a million miles away from the stuck-up Hill
LAFB-1114||I wouldn't even thinking about Laura when she came up to me in the drugstore and asked me to take her to the next negro dance at the Roseland
LAFB-1115||Duke Ellington was going to play and she was beside herself with excitement
LAFB-1116||I had no way to know what was going to happen
LAFB-1117||she asked me to pick her up at her house this time I didn't want any contact with the old grandma she had described but I went
LAFB-1118||Grandma answered the door and old-fashioned rankled black woman with fuzzy gray hair
LAFB-1119||she just open the door nothing me to get it not even saying as much as come in dog
LAFB-1120||I've faced on detectors in gangsters less hostile than she was
LAFB-1121||I remember the musty living room full of those old Christ pictures prayers woven into tapestries statuettes of the crucifixion other religious objects on the mantel shelves table
LAFB-1122||walls everywhere since the old lady wasn't speaking to me I didn't speak to her either
LAFB-1123||I completely sympathize with her now of course
LAFB-1124||what could she have thought of me in my Zoup and caulk and orange shoes
LAFB-1125||she'd have done us all a favor if she had run screaming for the police if something look in his eye did ever came knocking at my door today asking to see one of my four daughters I know I would explode
LAFB-1126||when Laura rushed into the room jerking on her coat I could see that she was upset and angry and embarrassed and in the taxi she started crying
LAFB-1127||she has hated herself for lying before she decided to tell the truth about where she was going and there had been a screaming battle with Grandma
LAFB-1128||Laura had told the old lady that she was going to start going out when and where she wanted to or she would quit school and get a job and move out on her own and Grandma had pitched a fit
LAFB-1129||Laura just walked out when we got to the Roseland we danced the early part of the evening with each other and with different partners and finally do kicked off show time
LAFB-1130||I knew and Laura knew that she couldn't match the veteran Showtime girls but she told me that she wanted to compete
LAFB-1131||and the next thing I knew she was among those girls over on the sidelines changing into sneakers
LAFB-1132||I shook my head when a couple of freelancing girls ran up to me
LAFB-1133||as always the crowd clapped and shouted in time with the blasting band go red go partly it was my reputation and partly Laura's ballet style of dancing that helped to turn the spotlight and the crowd's attention to us
LAFB-1134||they never had seen the feather lightness that she gave to lending a completely fresh Styles and they will connoisseurs of styles
LAFB-1135||I turned up the steam Morris feet with flying I had her in the air down side
LAFB-1136||ways around backwards up again down werling
LAFB-1137||the spotlight was working mostly just us I caught glimpses of the four or five other couples the girls jungle straws animal-like bucking and charging but little Laura inspired me to drive to New Heights
LAFB-1138||her hair was all over her face was running sweat and I couldn't believe her strength
LAFB-1139||the crowd was shouting and stomping a new favorite was being discovered there was a wall of noise around us
LAFB-1140||filter weakling she was Lindy young like a fighter out on her feet and we stumbled off to the sidelines the band was still blasting I had to have carrier she was gasping for air
LAFB-1141||some of the men in the band applauded and even Duke Ellington half raised up from his piano stool and bound
LAFB-1142||if a Showtime crowd like your performance when
LAFB-1143||okay Mom you were mobbed mold grabs and pummeled like the team that's just taken the series
LAFB-1144||one bunch of the crowd swarmed Laura they had her clear up off her feet and I was being pounded on the back when I caught this fine blondes eyes
LAFB-1145||this one I'd never seen among the white girls who came to the Roseland black dances
LAFB-1147||it's shameful to admit but I had just about forgotten Laura when she got loose From the Mob and rushed up big eyed and stop
LAFB-1148||I guess she saw what there was to see in that girls
LAFB-1149||and mine as we moved out to dance
LAFB-1150||I'm going to call her Sofia she didn't dance well at least not by negro standards but who cares
LAFB-1151||I can feel the staring eyes of other couples around us
LAFB-1152||we talked I told her she was a good dancer and ask her where she'd learned
LAFB-1153||I was trying to find out why she was there most white women came to the black dancers for reasons I knew but you seldom saw her kind around there
LAFB-1154||she had big answers for everything but in the space of that dance we agreed that I would get Laura home early and rushed back in a taxicab and then she asked if I'd like to go for a drive later I felt very lucky
LAFB-1155||Laura was home and I was back at the Roseland in an hour flat Sophia was waiting outside
LAFB-1156||about five blocks down she had a load convertible
LAFB-1157||she knew where she was going Beyond Boston she pulled off into a side
LAFB-1158||Road and then off that into a deserted Lane and turned off everything but the radio
LAFB-1159||for the next several months Sophia would pick me up downtown and I'd take her to dances and to the bars around Roxbury
LAFB-1160||we drove all over sometimes it would be nearly daylight when she let me out in front of Ella's
LAFB-1161||I paraded her the Negro men loved her and she just seemed to love all Negroes
LAFB-1162||two or three nights a week we would go out together Sophia admitted that she also had dates with white fellows just for the look of thing she said she swore that a white man couldn't interest her
LAFB-1163||I wondered for a long time but I never did find out why she approached me so boldly that first night
LAFB-1164||I always thought it was because of some earlier experience with another negro but I never asked and she never said
LAFB-1165||never ask a woman about other men either she'll tell you a lie and you still won't know or if she tells you the truth you might not have wanted to hear it in the first place
LAFB-1166||anyway she seemed entranced with me I began to see less of shorty and when I did see him and the Gang he would job man I had to calm the birds out of my homeboys had now he's got a Beacon Hill chick
LAFB-1167||but truly because it was known that your teeth at schooled me my having Sophia gave shorty status
LAFB-1168||when I introduced her to him she hugged him like a sister and it just about finished shorty off
LAFB-1169||his best had been white prostitutes and a few of those poor specimens that worked around in the Mills and had discovered Negroes
LAFB-1170||it was when I began to be seen around town with Sophia that I really began to mature into some real status in Black downtown Roxbury
LAFB-1172||of course I knew that reason like I knew my own name they wanted to steal my fine white woman away from me
LAFB-1173||in the ghetto was in Suburbia it's the same status struggle to stand out in some envied way from the rest
LAFB-1174||at sixteen I didn't have the money to buy a Cadillac but she had her own find rubber as we called the car in those days and I had her which was even better
LAFB-1175||Laura never again came to the drugstore as long as I continue to work there
LAFB-1176||the next time I saw her she was the wreck of a woman notoriously around black Roxbury in and out of jail
LAFB-1177||she had finished high school but by then she was already going the wrong way
LAFB-1178||defying her grandmother she had started going out late and drinking liquor this led to dope and that to selling herself to men learning to hate the man who bought her she also became a lesbian
LAFB-1179||one of the shames I've carried four years is that I blame myself for all of this
LAFB-1180||to have treated her as I did for a white woman made the blow doubly heavy
LAFB-1181||the only excuse I can offer is that like so many of my black Brothers today I was just deaf dumb and blind
LAFB-1182||in any case it wasn't long after I met Sophia the telephone doubt about it and watching from the windows one early morning saw me getting out of Sophia's car
LAFB-1183||not surprisingly Ella began treating me like a Viper
LAFB-1184||about then shorties present finally moved in with the woman he was so crazy about and Sophia Finance me to take over half of the apartment with Shorty and I quit the drugstore and soon found a new job
LAFB-1185||I became a busboy at the Parker House in Boston I wore a start white jacket out in the dining room where the waiters would put the customers dirty plates and silver on big aluminum trays which I would take back to the kitchens dishwashers
LAFB-1186||a few weeks later one Sunday morning I ran into work expecting to get fired I was so late
LAFB-1187||but the whole kitchen crew was too excited and upset to notice
LAFB-1188||Japanese planes had just bombed the place called Pearl Harbor
LAFB-1190||every other day for 4 hours between Boston and New York in the coach Isles of the New York New Haven and Hartford Yankee Clipper
LAFB-1191||old man Roundtree and elderly Pullman Porter and a friend of Ella's had recommended the railroad job for me he had told her the war was snatching away railroad man so fast that if I could pass with 21 he could get me on
LAFB-1192||Ella wanted to get me out of Boston and away from Sofia she would have love nothing better than to have seen me like one of those Negroes who are already thronging Roxbury in the Army's khaki and thick shoes
LAFB-1193||home on leave for boot camp but my age of 16 stopped at
LAFB-1194||I went along with the railroad job for my own reasons for a long time I'd wanted to visit New York City
LAFB-1195||since I had been in Roxbury I had heard a lot about the Big Apple that it was called by the well-traveled musicians Merchant Mariners salesman chauffeur
LAFB-1196||for white families in various kinds of hustlers I ran into
LAFB-1197||even as far back as Lansing I have been hearing about how Fabulous New York was especially Harlem
LAFB-1198||in fact my father had described hauling with pride and showed us pictures of the huge parade by the Harlem followers of Marcus Garvey
LAFB-1200||everything I've ever heard about New York City was exciting
LAFB-1201||things like Broadway's bright lights and the Savoy ballroom and Apollo Theater in Harlem with great bands played and famous songs and dance step and negro Stars originate
LAFB-1202||but you couldn't just pick up and go visit New York from Lansing or Boston or anywhere else not without money
LAFB-1203||so I'd never really given too much thought to getting to New York until the freeway to travel there came in the form of Ella's talked with all man Roundtree who was a member of Ella's Church
LAFB-1204||what Ella didn't know of course was that I would continue to see Sophia Sophia could get away only a few nights a week
LAFB-1205||she said when I told her about the train job that she get away every night I got back into Boston and this would mean every other night if I got the run I wanted
LAFB-1206||Sophia didn't want me to leave at all but she believed I was drafted already and thought the train job would keep me out of the army
LAFB-1207||shorty thought it would be a great chance for me he was worried sick himself about the draft called that he knew was soon to come
LAFB-1208||like hundreds of the black ghettos young men he was taking some stuff that it was said would make your heart sound effective to the draft boards doctors
LAFB-1209||shorty felt about the war the same way I am most ghetto Negroes dead Whitey owns everything he wants us to go and bleeds for him let him fight
LAFB-1210||anyway at the railroad Personnel hiring office down on Dover Street attired acting old white clerk got down to the crucial point when I came to sign up
LAFB-1211||age little when I told him 21 he never lifted his eyes from his pencil I knew I had the job
LAFB-1213||temporarily though they put me on the colonial that ran to Washington d.c.
LAFB-1214||the kitchen crew headed by a West Indian Chef named Duke Vaughn work with almost unbelievable efficiency in the
LAFB-1215||French Quarters against the sound of the train clacking along the waiters were jabbering the customer's orders the cooks operated like machine and five hundred miles of 30 pots and dishes and silverware rattled back to me
LAFB-1216||then on the overnight layover I naturally went sightseeing in downtown Washington
LAFB-1217||I was astounded to find in the nation's capital just a few blocks from Capitol Hill thousands of negroes living worse than any I'd ever seen in the poorest sections of Roxbury
LAFB-1218||interflora Shacks along unspeakably filthy Lanes with names like pigalle and go tally
LAFB-1219||I have seen a lot but never such a dense concentration of stumblebum pushers hookers public crapshooter's even little kids running around at midnight begging for pennies half naked and barefooted
LAFB-1220||some of the railroad cooks and waiters and told me to be very careful because muggings knifing and rah
LAFB-1221||Breeze went on every night among those Negroes just a few blocks from the White House
LAFB-1222||but I saw other Negroes better off
LAFB-1223||they lived in blocks at rundown red brick houses
LAFB-1225||after a few of the Washington runs I snatched the chance when 1-day Personnel said I could temporarily replace a sandwich man on the Yankee Clipper to New York
LAFB-1226||I was into my Zoot Suit before the first passenger got off
LAFB-1227||The Kooks took me up to Harlem in a cab white New York passed by like a movie set then abruptly when we left Central Park at the upper
LAFB-1228||at 110th Street the people's complexion began to change
LAFB-1229||busy 7th Avenue ran along in front of a place called Smalls Paradise
LAFB-1230||the crew at told me before we left Boston that it was their favorite night spot in Harlem and not to miss it
LAFB-1231||no negro place of business had ever impressed me so much
LAFB-1232||around the big luxurious looking circular bar with 30 or 40 Negroes mostly men drinking and talkin
LAFB-1233||I was hit first I think by their conservative clothes and manners
LAFB-1234||whenever I've seen as many as 10 Boston d-rose let alone Lansing Negroes drinking there had been a big noise
LAFB-1235||but with all of these Harlem Nights drinking and talkin there was just a low murmur of sound
LAFB-1236||customers came and went the bartender's knew what most of them drank and automatically fixed it a bottle was set on the bar before some
LAFB-1238||Their Manners seemed natural they were not putting on any airs I was on
LAFB-1239||within the first 5 minutes in Smalls I had left Boston and Roxbury forever
LAFB-1240||I didn't know yet the bees weren't what you might call everyday or average Harlem Negroes
LAFB-1241||later on even later that night I would find out that Harlem contained hundreds of thousands of my people who were just as loud and Guardians Negroes anywhere else
LAFB-1242||but these were the cream of the older more mature operators in Harlem
LAFB-1243||today's numbers business was done the nights gambling and other forms of hustling hadn't yet begun
LAFB-1244||the usual nightlife crowd who worked on regular jobs all day we're at home eating their dinners the hustlers at this time we're in the daily six congregation having their favorite bars all over Harlem largely to themselves
LAFB-1245||from small attack seed over to the Apollo Theater I remember so well that Jay mcshane's band was playing because his vocalist was later with my close friend Walter Brown the one who used to sing Hootie Hootie Blues
LAFB-1246||from there on the other side of 125th Street at 7th Avenue ice all the big tall gray Teresa Hotel
LAFB-1247||it was the finest in New York City where Negroes could stay then years before the downtown hotels what except the black man
LAFB-1248||the Theresa is now best known as the place where Fidel Castro went during his un visit and achieved a psychological cool over
LAFB-1249||US state department when it confined him to Manhattan never dreaming that he'd stay Uptown Harlem and make such an impression among the Negroes
LAFB-1251||as Dinah Washington was leaving with some friends I overheard someone say she was on her way to the Savoy Ballroom where Lionel Hampton was appearing that night she was then hamp's vocalist
LAFB-1252||the ballroom made the Roseland and Boston look small and shabby by comparison
LAFB-1253||and the Lindy Hop in their match the size and elegance of the place
LAFB-1254||Champs hard-driving outfit kept a red-hot pace with his
LAFB-1255||write such as Arnett Cobb Illinois jacquet Dexter Gordon Alvin Hayes Joe Newman and George Jenkins
LAFB-1256||I want a couple of rounds on the floor with the girls from the sidelines
LAFB-1257||probably a third of the sideline booze were filled with white people mostly just watching the Negroes dance but some of them dance together and as in Boston a few white women were with Negroes
LAFB-1258||the people kept shouting for him flying home and finally he did
LAFB-1259||I could believe the story I'd heard in Boston about this number that once in the Apollo hamp's flying home had made some reefer smoking negro in the second balcony believe he could fly so he tried and jumped and broke his leg
LAFB-1260||an event later immortalized in song when Earl Hines wrote a hit tune called second balcony jump
LAFB-1261||I have never seen such Beaver heat dancing after a couple of slow numbers
LAFB-1262||play soft they brought on Dinah Washington
LAFB-1263||once you get her salty papa blue's those people just about tore the Savoy roof off
LAFB-1264||for Diana's funeral was have not long ago in Chicago
LAFB-1265||I read over 20,000 people viewed her body and I should have been there myself
LAFB-1266||Paul Diner we became great friends back in those days
LAFB-1267||but this night of my first visit was kitchen mechanic night at the Savoy
LAFB-1268||the traditional Thursday night off for domestics
LAFB-1269||I'd say they were twice as many women as men in there not only kitchen workers and Maids but also War wives and defense worker women lonely and looking
LAFB-1270||out in the street when I left the ballroom I heard a prostitute cursing bitterly that the professionals couldn't do any business because of the amateurs
LAFB-1271||up and down along and between Lenox and 7th and 8th Avenue
LAFB-1272||Harlem with spikes on Technicolor Bazaar
LAFB-1273||hundreds of negro Soldiers & Sailors gawking and young like me pass by
LAFB-1274||Harlem by now was officially off-limits to White servicemen
LAFB-1275||there had been some muggings and robberies and several white servicemen have been found murdered
LAFB-1276||the police were also trying to discourage white civilians from coming up down but those who wanted to still did
LAFB-1278||get another 2 years I could have given them all lessons but that night I was mesmerized
LAFB-1279||this world was where I belong on that night I had started on my way to becoming a hard-on might
LAFB-1280||I was going to become one of the most depraved parasitical Hustlers among New York eight million people 4 million of homework and the other four million who live off them
LAFB-1281||I couldn't quite believe all that I had heard and seen that night as I loved my shoulder strap sandwich boxing that heavy 5-gallon aluminum coffee pot up and down the aisles of the Yankee Clipper back to Boston
LAFB-1282||I wished that Ella and I had been on better terms so that I could try to describe to her how I felt
LAFB-1283||but I did talk to shorty urging him to at least go to see the Big Apple music world
LAFB-1284||Sofia listen to me too she told me that I'd never be satisfied anywhere but New York she was so right
LAFB-1285||in one night New York Harlem had just about narcotized me
LAFB-1286||that sandwich man I'd replaced had little chance of getting his job back
LAFB-1287||I went bellowing up and down those train aisle
LAFB-1288||I sold sandwiches coffee candy cake and ice cream as fast as the railroads commissary Department could Supply them
LAFB-1289||it didn't take me a week to learn that all you had to do was give white people the show when they buy anything you offered them
LAFB-1290||it was like popping you shoe shine rag the dining car waiters and Pullman Porters new at 2 and they faked their uncle-tomming to get bigger tips
LAFB-1291||we were in that world of negroes who were both servants and psychologists aware that white people are so obsessed with their own importance that they will pay liberally he even dearly for the impression of being catered to and entertained
LAFB-1292||every layover night in Harlem Iran and explore new places I first got a room at the Harlem YMCA because it was less than a block from small Paradise
LAFB-1293||then I got a cheaper room at mrs. Fisher's rooming house which was close to the YMCA
LAFB-1294||most of the railroad men stated mrs. Fisher's
LAFB-1296||dirt garbage cans overflowing or kicked over drunks do batiks beggars
LAFB-1297||sleazy bars front store churches with gospel being shouted inside
LAFB-1298||bargain stores hot shops undertaking parlors
LAFB-1299||greasy home cooking restaurants beauty shops smoky inside from negro woman's hair getting fries
LAFB-1300||barber shops advertising conch experts
LAFB-1301||Cadillacs second-hand and new
LAFB-1302||conspicuous among the cars on the street
LAFB-1303||all of it was land things Westside or Roxbury South End magnified a thousand times
LAFB-1305||negro and white canvases sidled up alongside you talkin fast as they tried to get you to buy a copy of the daily worker
LAFB-1306||this paper is trying to keep your rent controlled make that greedy landlord killed them rats in your partner
LAFB-1307||this paper represents the only political party that ever ran a black man for the vice presidency of the United States just want you to read won't take but a little of your time
LAFB-1308||who do you think bought the hardest to help free those Scottsboro
LAFB-1309||things I overheard among Negroes when the salesman were around let me know that the paper somehow was tied in with the Russians but to my sterile mind in those days didn't mean much
LAFB-1310||the radio broadcast of the newspapers within full of our Ally Russia a strong muscular people peasants with their backs to the wall helping America to fight Hitler and Mussolini
LAFB-1311||but New York was Heaven to me and Harlem was 7th Heaven
LAFB-1312||I hung around and Smalls in the Braddock bars so much that the bartenders began to pour a shot of bourbon my favorite brand of it when they saw me walk in the door
LAFB-1313||and the steady customers in both places the hustlers and Smalls and the entertainers in the Braddock begin to call me read unnatural enough nickname and view of my bright red conch
LAFB-1314||I now had my conch done in Boston at the shop of Abbott and fogy it was the best conch shop on the East Coast according to the musical Grace who would recommended it to me
LAFB-1316||he was hitting the heights then with his song hey pretty mama chunk me in your big brass bed
LAFB-1317||I also knew solid he was married to a red complexion girl and they lived up on Sugar Hill Side it a lot of arranging for Tommy Dorsey in those days is most famous to not believe was yes indeed
LAFB-1318||the regular Yankee Clipper Sandwich Man when he came back was put on another train
LAFB-1319||he complained about seniority but my sales record made them placate him some other way
LAFB-1320||the waiters and Cooks have begun to call me sandwich read
LAFB-1321||by that time they had a laughing bet going that I wasn't going to last
LAFB-1322||sales or not because I was so rapidly becoming such an uncouth wild young Libra
LAFB-1323||profanity had become my language I'd even cursed customers especially servicemen I couldn't stand them
LAFB-1325||I remember the tension I laughed and told him sure I'll fight but you got too many clothes on
LAFB-1328||never would forget that that I couldn't have whip that white man is badly with a club as I had with my mind
LAFB-1329||many of the New Haven line cooks and waiters stealing railroad service today would remember old Pappy cousins he was the Yankee Clipper Stewart a white man of course from Maine
LAFB-1330||Negroes have been in Dining Car Service as much as 30 and 40 years but in those days there were no negro Stewart's on the New Haven line
LAFB-1331||anyway Pappy cousins loved whiskey and they like everybody even me
LAFB-1332||a lot of Passenger complaints about me Pappy had let slide he'd ask some of the old Negroes working with me to try and calm me down
LAFB-1333||man you can't tell him nothing they'd exclaimed and they couldn't
LAFB-1334||at home in Roxbury they would see me parading with Sophia guest in my wild zoot suits
LAFB-1335||then I'd come to work loud and wild and have high on liquor or reefers and I
LAFB-1336||hey that way jamming sandwiches if people until we got to New York
LAFB-1337||off the train I go to that Grand Central Station afternoon rush-hour crowd and many white people simply stopped in their tracks to watch me pass
LAFB-1338||the draping the cut of a Zoot Suit show to the best Advantage if you were tall and I was over 6 feet my cock was Fire Red
LAFB-1339||I was really a clown but my ignorance made me think I was sharp my knob toed orange-colored kick up shoes with nothing but floor shines the ghettos Cadillac of shoes in those days
LAFB-1340||some shoe companies made these ridiculous tiles for sale only in the black ghettos we're ignorant Negroes like me would pay the big-name price for something that we associated with being rich
LAFB-1341||and then between tomorrow's Paradise the Braddock hotel in other places
LAFB-1342||as much as my 20 or $25 pay with Ally while I drink liquor smoke marijuana
LAFB-1343||painted the big apple red with increasing numbers of friends and finding and mrs. Fisher's rooming house I got a few hours of sleep before the Yankee Clipper roll again
LAFB-1344||it was inevitable that I was going to be fired sooner or later
LAFB-1345||what finally finished me was an angry letter from a passenger
LAFB-1346||the conductor's added their B telling how many verbal complaints they had and how many warnings I've been given
LAFB-1347||but I didn't care because of those wartime days such jobs as I could have Spire too we're going begging
LAFB-1348||when the New Haven line paid me off I decided it would be nice to make a trip to visit my brothers and sisters in Lansing
LAFB-1349||I had accumulated some railroad free travel privileges
LAFB-1350||none of them back in Michigan could believe it was me
LAFB-1351||only my oldest brother Wilfred wasn't there he was away at Wilberforce University in Ohio studying a trade
LAFB-1352||but Phil Burton Hilda we're working in Lansing
LAFB-1353||channeled the one who would always looked up to me had gotten big enough to fake his age and he was planning soon to enter the Merchant Marine
LAFB-1354||even Westley and Robert were in school
LAFB-1355||my car can hold costume was so wild that I might have been taking it the man from Mars
LAFB-1356||I called the minor automobile Collision One driver stop the gate with me and the driver behind bumped into him
LAFB-1357||my parents staggered the older boys I had once envied I'd stick out of my hand saying skin me Daddio
LAFB-1358||my stories about two Big Apple my reefers keeping me Sky High wherever I went I was the life of the party my man give me some skin
LAFB-1359||the only thing that brought me down to Earth was the visit to the state hospital in Kalamazoo
LAFB-1360||my mother sort of half cent to I was
LAFB-1361||and I looked up shorties mother I knew he'd be touched by my doing that
LAFB-1362||she was an old lady and she was glad to hear from shorty through me
LAFB-1363||I told her that shorty was doing fine and one day he was going to be a great leader of his own bad
LAFB-1364||she asked me to tell shorty that she'd wished he'd write her and send her something
LAFB-1365||and I dropped over to Mason to see Mrs swirling the woman at the detention home who would kept me those couple of years
LAFB-1366||her mouth flew open when she came to the door
LAFB-1368||between the way I looked and my style of talk I made her so nervous and uncomfortable that we were both glad when I left
LAFB-1369||the night before I left a dance was given in the Lincoln school gymnasium
LAFB-1370||I've since learned that in the strange city to find the Negroes without asking where
LAFB-1371||you just check in the phone book for a Lincoln School it's always located in the segregated black ghetto at least it was in those days
LAFB-1372||I'd left Lansing unable to dance but now I went around the gymnasium floor flinging little girls over my shoulders and hips showing my most startling steps
LAFB-1373||several times the little band nearly stopped and nearly everybody left the floor watching with their eyes like saucers that night I even signed autographs Harlem red and I left Lansing shocked and rocked
LAFB-1374||back in New York Stone broke and without any means of support I realized that the railroad was all that I actually knew anything about
LAFB-1375||so I went over to the Seaboard lines hiring office
LAFB-1376||the railroads needed men so badly that all I had to do was tell them I had worked on the New Haven and two days later I was on the silver meteor to St Peters
LAFB-1377||and Miami renting pillows and keeping the coaches clean and the white passengers happy I made about as much as I had with sandwiches
LAFB-1378||I soon ran if all of the Florida Cracker who was assistant conductor
LAFB-1380||the owner of the bar was Ed small he and his brother Charlie were inseparable and I guess Harlem didn't have two more popular and respected people
LAFB-1381||they knew I was a railroad man which for a waiter was the best kind of recommendation
LAFB-1382||Charlie small was the one I'd actually talked with in their office
LAFB-1383||I was afraid he'd want to wait to ask some of his old-time areal
LAFB-1384||girlfriends for their opinion Charlie would have gone for anybody he heard was wild
LAFB-1385||but he decided on the basis of his own impression having seen me in his place so many times sitting quietly almost an are observing the hustling set
LAFB-1386||I told him when he asked that I never been in trouble with the police and up to then that was the truth
LAFB-1387||Charlie told me that rules for employees no lateness no laziness No Stealing no kind of hustling off any customers especially man in uniform and I was hired
LAFB-1388||this was a 1942 I had just turned 17
LAFB-1389||with Smalls practically in the center of everything waiting tables there was 7th Heaven seven times over
LAFB-1390||Charlie small had no need to caution me against being late I was so anxious to be there I derive an hour early
LAFB-1391||I relieve the morning waiter as far as he was concerned mine was
LAFB-1392||slowest most no tips time of day and sometimes he'd stick around most of that our teaching me things for he didn't want to see me fired
LAFB-1393||thanks to him I learned very quickly dozens of little things that could really ingratiate a new waiter with the cooks and bartenders
LAFB-1394||both of these depending on how they like the waiter could make his job miserable or Pleasant and I meant to become indispensable
LAFB-1395||inside of a week I had succeeded with both and the customers who have seen me among them around the bar recognizing me now in the waiters jacket we're pleased and surprised and they couldn't have been more friendly and I couldn't have been more solicitous
LAFB-1396||another drink right away sir would you like dinner
LAFB-1397||it's very good could I get you a menu sir
LAFB-1398||but maybe a sandwich not only the bartenders and Cooks who knew everything about everything it seems to me but he
LAFB-1399||the customers also began to school me and the little conversations by the bar when I wasn't busy sometimes a customer would talk to me as he ate sometimes I have long talks absorbing everything with the real Old-Timers who would been around Harlem since Negroes first came there
LAFB-1400||that in fact was one of my biggest surprises that Harlem hadn't always been a community of negroes
LAFB-1401||it first have been a Dutch settlement I learned then began the massive waves of poor and half-starved and ragged immigrants from Europe arriving with everything they owned in the world in bags and sacks on their backs
LAFB-1402||the Germans came first the Dutch edged away from them and Harlem became all German
LAFB-1404||and then the Italians left today all these immigrants descendants are running as hard as they can to escape the descendants of negroes who help to unload the Immigrant ships
LAFB-1406||MidFirst been in the Wall Street area then they were pushed into Greenwich Village
LAFB-1407||the next job was up to the Pennsylvania station area and then the last stop before Harlem the black ghetto was concentrated around 52nd Street which is how 52nd Street got the swing street name and reputation that lasted long after the Negroes were gone
LAFB-1408||Bennett 1910a nigra real-estate man somehow
LAFB-1410||virtually all black then early in the 1920s music and entertainment spring up as an industry in Harlem supported by downtown white who poured Uptown every night
LAFB-1411||it all started about the time a tough young New Orleans cornet man named Louis Satchmo Armstrong climbed off a train in New York wearing clodhopper policeman shoes and started playing with Fletcher Henderson
LAFB-1412||in 1925 small Paradise at open with crowds all across 7th Avenue in 1926 the great Cotton Club where Duke Ellington's band would play 45 years
LAFB-1413||also in 19/26 the Savoy Ballroom opened
LAFB-1414||ahold blockfront on Lenox Avenue with a 200-foot Dancefloor on the spotlight before to Bandstand and the disappearing rear stage
LAFB-1415||Harlem's famous image spread until it's warmed nightly with white people from all over the world
LAFB-1416||the tourist buses came there The Cotton Club cater to whites only and hundreds of other clubs ranging on down to Cellar speakeasies catered to white people's money
LAFB-1417||some of the best-known where Connie's in the Lenox Club Barons The Nest Club Jimmie's Chicken Shack and minton's
LAFB-1418||the Savoy the Golden Gate and the Renaissance ballrooms battle for the crowds
LAFB-1419||the Savoy introduce such attractions as Thursday kitchen mechanics night bathing beauty contest and a new car given away each Saturday night
LAFB-1420||they advance from all across the country in the ballrooms and the Apollo in Lafayette Theaters
LAFB-1421||dead colorful band leaders like Fest Williams in his diamond-studded suit and top hat
LAFB-1422||and Cab Calloway in his white Zoot Suit to end all Zeus and his wide-brimmed white hat and string tie setting Harlem a fire with tiger Rag and St James Infirmary in Minnie the Moocher
LAFB-1423||Blacktown crawled with white people with pimps prostitutes Bootlegger's with hustlers of all kinds with colorful characters and with police and prohibition agents
LAFB-1424||Negroes dance like they never have anywhere before or since
LAFB-1425||I guess I must have heard 25 of the old-timers and Smalls swear to me that they had been the first to dance in the Savoy the Lindy Hop which was born there in 1920
LAFB-1426||7 name for Lindbergh would just made his flight to Paris
LAFB-1427||even the little Cellar places with only piano space had fabulous keyboard artists such as James P Johnson and jelly roll Morton and singers such as Ethel Waters
LAFB-1429||when it all ended with the stock market crashed in 1929 Harlem had a world reputation as America's Casbah
LAFB-1430||Smalls had been apart of all that there I heard the old-timers reminisce about all those great times
LAFB-1431||everyday I listened rapley to customers who felt like talking and it all added to my education
LAFB-1432||my ears soaked it up like sponges when one of them in a rare burst of confidence or a little Beyond his usual number of drinks would tell me inside things about the particular form of hustling that he pursued as a way of life
LAFB-1433||I was the schools well by expert in such hustles as the numbers pimping con games of many kinds peddling dope thievery of All Sorts including armed robbery
LAFB-1435||I saw people on there long wild spending sprees after big hits I don't mean just Hustlers who always had some money I mean ordinary working people the kind that we otherwise almost
LAFB-1436||ever saw in a bar like Smalls who was a good enough hid at quit their jobs working somewhere downtown for the white man
LAFB-1438||hundreds of thousands of New York City Negros everyday but Sunday would play from a penny on up two large sums on three digit numbers
LAFB-1439||a hit meant duplicating the last 3 figures from the stock exchanges printed daily total of us domestic and foreign sales
LAFB-1440||with the odds at 600 21 a penny hit one $6 a dollar One 600 and so on
LAFB-1441||on $15 the hit would mean 9000
LAFB-1442||famous hits like that had bought controlling interest in lots of Harlem's bars and restaurants or even bought some of them out right
LAFB-1443||the chances of hitting were thousand 21 many players practice what was called combinator
LAFB-1444||for example $0.06 would put one penny on each of the six possible combinations of three digits
LAFB-1445||the number 840, dated would include 8408 0404 80-84 408 and 480
LAFB-1446||practically everyone played everyday in the poverty-ridden black ghetto of Harlem Every Day's someone you knew was likely to hit and of course it was Neighborhood News if big enough of it neighborhood excitement
LAFB-1447||it's generally with small a Nickel Dime or quarter
LAFB-1448||most people tried to play a dollar a day but split it up among different numbers and compensated
LAFB-1449||Harlem's number industry hummed every morning and into the early afternoon with the runners jotting down people's bets on slips of paper and apartment house hallways bars barbershops stores on the sidewalks
LAFB-1450||the cops looked on no Runner lasted long who didn't out of his pocket put in a free figure for his working areas foot cops and it was generally known that the numbers back is paid off at higher levels of the police
LAFB-1451||the daily small army of Runners each got 10% of the money they turned in along with the BET slips to their controllers and if you hit you gave the number Runner a 10% tip
LAFB-1452||a controller might have as many as fifty Runners working for him and the controller got 5% of what he turned over to the banker who paid off the hit paid off the police and got rich off the balance
LAFB-1453||some people played one number all year many had lists of the daily
LAFB-1454||numbers going back for years they figured reappearance odds and used other systems others played their hunches addresses license numbers of passing cars any numbers on letters telegrams laundry slips numbers from anywhere
LAFB-1455||dream books that cost a dollar would say what number nearly Any Dream suggested evangelist to on Sundays pedal Jesus and Mystics would pray a lucky number for you for a fee
LAFB-1456||recently the last three numbers of the post office is new zip code for a postal District in Harlem hit and one Banker almost went broke
LAFB-1458||everyday in Smalls Paradise was fascinating to me
LAFB-1459||and from a harlem point of view I couldn't have been in a more educational situation
LAFB-1460||some of the ablest of New York black Hustlers took a liking to me and knowing that I was still green by their terms soon began in a paternal way to straighten red out
LAFB-1461||their methods would be indirect a dark businessman looking West Indian often would sit at one of my tables
LAFB-1462||one day when I brought his beer he said red hold still a minute
LAFB-1463||he went over me with one of those yellow tape measures and jotted figures in his notebook
LAFB-1464||when I came to work the next afternoon one of the bartenders handed me a package
LAFB-1465||and it wasn't expensive dark blue suit conservatively cut
LAFB-1466||the gift was thoughtful and the message clear
LAFB-1467||the bartender's let me know that this customer was one of the top Executives of the fabulous Forty Thieves
LAFB-1468||that was the gang of organized boosters who would deliver to order in one day codeine kind of garment you desired you would pay about 1/3 of the stores price
LAFB-1469||I heard how they made massholes
LAFB-1470||A well-dressed member of the gang who wouldn't arouse suspicion by his manner would go into a selected store about closing time hide somewhere and get locked inside when the store closed
LAFB-1471||the police patrols would have been time beforehand
LAFB-1472||after dark keep tactsuit sandbags then turn off the burglar alarm and use the telephone to call awaiting truck and crew
LAFB-1473||when the truck came timed with the police patrols it would be loaded and gone within a few minutes
LAFB-1474||I later got to know several members of the Forty Thieves
LAFB-1475||plainclothes detectives soon we'll quietly identified to me by an odd
LAFB-1476||a wink knowing the law people in the area was elementary for the hustlers and like them in time I would learn to sense the presence of any police types
LAFB-1478||longshoreman or fences for them would come into the bars selling guns cameras perfumes watches and the like stolen from the shipping docks
LAFB-1479||these Negroes got what white longshoremen thievery left over
LAFB-1480||Merchant Marine Sailors often brought in foreign items Bargains and the best marijuana cigarettes to be had were made from the gungeon kishka that Merchant Sailors smuggled in from Africa and Persia
LAFB-1481||in the daytime whites were giving a guarded tree
LAFB-1482||why two came in at night got a better reception
LAFB-1483||the several Harlem nightclub they patronize were geared to entertain and Jive the nitewhite crowd to get their money
LAFB-1484||and with so many law agencies guarding the morals of servicemen
LAFB-1485||any of them that came in and a lot did we're giving what they asked for and were spoken to if they spoke and that was all unless someone knew them as natives of Harlem
LAFB-1487||the bartender's would let me know which among the regular customers were mostly fronts and which really had something going
LAFB-1488||which were really in the Underworld with downtown police or political connections which really handled to money and which were making it from day today
LAFB-1489||which were the real gamblers and which had just hit a little luck and which one never to run afoul of in any way
LAFB-1490||the latter were extremely well known about Harlem and they were feared and respected
LAFB-1491||it was known that if upset they would break open your head and think nothing of it
LAFB-1492||these were the old-timers not to be confused with the various hot-headed wild young Hustlers out trying to make a name for themselves for being crazy with a pistol trigger or a knife
LAFB-1493||the old heads that I'm talkin about what such as black Sammy Bob kulick King padmore and West Indian Archie
LAFB-1495||those tough Negroes his Heyday had been before the big 1931 Seabury investigation that started Dutch Schultz on the way out until his career ended with his 1934 assassination
LAFB-1497||there seemed to be an understanding that these Negroes and the tough black cops never clashed
LAFB-1498||I guess both knew that someone would die they had some bad black cops in Harlem 2
LAFB-1499||The Four Horsemen that works Sugarhill I remember the worst one had freckles there was a tough quartet
LAFB-1500||the biggest blackest worst cop of the mall in Harlem was the West Indian Brisbane
LAFB-1501||Negroes cross the street to avoid him when he walked his hundred and 25th Street and 7th Avenue B
LAFB-1502||when I was in prison someone brought me a story that Brisbane have been shot to death by a scared nervous young kid who hadn't been up from the south long enough to realize how bad Brisbane was
LAFB-1503||the world's most unlikely pimp was Cadillac Drake
LAFB-1504||it was shiny bald-headed built like a football used to call his huge belly the chippies playground
LAFB-1505||Cadillac had a string of about a dozen of the stringers scrawny is black and white street prostitutes and Arla
LAFB-1506||afternoon around the bar the old-timers who knew Cadillac well enough with peas M about how women who look like his made enough to feed themselves let alone him
LAFB-1507||aurore with laughter right along with us I can hear him no bad looking
LAFB-1508||in work order just about the complete opposite of Cadillac was the young smooth independent acting pimp Sammy the pimp
LAFB-1509||he could as I have mentioned pick out the tensile prostitute by watching their expressions in dance halls
LAFB-1510||Sammy and I became and time each other's closest friend
LAFB-1511||Sammy who was from Kentucky was a cool collected expert in his business and his business was women
LAFB-1512||like Cadillac he too had both black and white women out making his living
LAFB-1513||but Sammy's women who would come into small sometimes looking for him to give him money and have him buy them a drink we're about as beautiful as any prostitutes who operated anywhere I'd imagine
LAFB-1514||one of these white women known as Alabama Peach a blond could put everybody in stitches with her draw even the several negro women numbers controllers around Smalls really liked her
LAFB-1515||what made a lot of negroes around the bar laughed the hardest was the way she would take 3 syllables to say Niger but what you usually was saying was I just love niggars
LAFB-1517||finally right in her own home with her family away she threatened the Negro man who work for her father that if he didn't take her she would swear he tried rape
LAFB-1518||he had no choice except that he quit working for them
LAFB-1519||and from then on until she finished high school she managed it several times with other Negroes and she somehow came to New York and went straight to Harlem
LAFB-1520||later on Sammy told me how he happened to spot her in the Savoy not even dancing with anybody just standing on the sidelines watching and he could tell
LAFB-1521||and once she really went for Negroes the more the better Sammy said and wouldn't have a white man
LAFB-1522||I have wondered whatever became of her it was a big fat pimp we called dollar bill
LAFB-1523||you love the flashes Kansas City roll probably $51 bill folded with a 20 on the inside and a $100 bill on the outside we always wondered what dollar bill would do if someone ever stole his hundred-dollar cover
LAFB-1524||a man who in his prime could have stolen dollar bills whole roll blindfolded was threadbare, cold few clothes
LAFB-1525||few clothes have been one of the best pickpockets in Harlem back when the white people swarmed up every night in the 1920s but then during the Depression he contracted a bad case of arthritis
LAFB-1526||Edison his hands his finger joints were knotted and gnarled so that it made people uncomfortable to look at them
LAFB-1527||rain sleet or snow every afternoon about 6 few clothes would be a small telling tall tales about the old days and it was one of the days rituals for one or another regular customer to ask the bartender to give him drinks and me to feed him
LAFB-1528||my heart goes out to all of us who win those afternoons at Smalls enacted are seen with few clothes
LAFB-1529||I wish you could have seen him pleasantly high with drinks take his seat with dignity no begging not on anybody's welfare and open his napkin and study the day's menu that I gave him and place his order
LAFB-1530||I tell the cooks it was few clothes and he'd get the best in the house I'd go back and serve it as though he were a millionaire
LAFB-1531||many times since I have thought about it and what it really meant
LAFB-1532||in one sense we were huddled in their bonded together and seeking
LAFB-1533||Purity and warmth and comfort from each other and we didn't know it
LAFB-1534||all of us who might have probe space or cured cancer or built industries were instead black victims of the white man's American social system
LAFB-1535||in another sense the tragedy of the once master pickpocket made him for those brother old-timer Hustlers up there but for the grace of God symbol
LAFB-1536||two wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits it had meaning that an old wolf with lost his fangs with still eating
LAFB-1537||then there was the burglar jumpsteady in the ghettos the white man has built for us he has forced us not to Aspire to greater things but the view everyday living as survival and then that kind of community survival is what is respected
LAFB-1538||in any Average White neighborhood bar you couldn't imagine a known Catman Thief regularly exposing himself as one of the most popular people in there
LAFB-1539||but if jumpsteady missed a few days running and Smalls we would begin inquiring fan
LAFB-1541||he got into Apartments through Windows it was said he was so cool that he had stolen even with people in the Next Room
LAFB-1542||I later found out that jumpsteady always keep himself up high on dope when he worked
LAFB-1543||he taught me some things that I was to employ and later years when hard times would force me to have my own burglary ring
LAFB-1544||I should stress that Smalls wasn't any nest of criminals I dwell upon the hustlers because it was their world that fascinated me
LAFB-1545||actually for The Nightlife crowd Smalls was one of Harlem's two or three most decorous night spots in fact
LAFB-1546||New York City Police Department recommended Smalls two white people who would ask for a safe place in Harlem
LAFB-1547||the first broom I got after I left the railroad half of Harlem ruined was in the 800 block of Saint Nicholas Avenue
LAFB-1548||you could walk into one or another room in this house and get a hot fur coat a good camera find perfume a gun anything from hot women to Hot Cars even hot ice
LAFB-1549||I was one of the very few males in this rooming house
LAFB-1550||this was during the war when you couldn't turn on the radio and not hear about Guadalcanal or North Africa
LAFB-1551||in several of the apartments the women tenants were prostitutes
LAFB-1552||the minority were in some other racket or hustle boosters numbers runners or dope Peddlers and I guess that everyone who lived in the house used dope of some kind
LAFB-1553||this shouldn't reflect too badly on that particular building because almost everyone in Harlem
LAFB-1554||needed some kind of hustle to survive and needed to stay high and some way to forget what they had to do to survive
LAFB-1555||it was in this house that I learned more about women than I ever did in any other single place
LAFB-1556||it was these working prostitutes who schooled me to things that every wife and every husband should know
LAFB-1557||later on it was chiefly the women who weren't prostitutes who taught me to be very distrustful of most women
LAFB-1558||there seem to be a higher code of ethics and sister lenus among these prostitutes than among numerous ladies of the church who have more men for kicks than the prostitutes have 4 pay
LAFB-1560||prostitutes with their husbands and children right there in New York
LAFB-1561||I got my first schooling about the Cesspool morals of the white man from the best possible Source from his own women and then as I got deeper into my own life of evil I saw the white man's morals with my own eyes
LAFB-1562||I even made my living helping to guide him to the sick things he wanted
LAFB-1563||I was young working in the bar not bothering with these women
LAFB-1564||probably I touch their kid brother Instinct something like that
LAFB-1565||some will drop into my room when they weren't busy and we would smoke reefers and talk
LAFB-1566||It generally would be after their morning rush but let me tell you about that Rush
LAFB-1568||Thirty in the morning then rushed away and by about 9 I would be the only man in the house
LAFB-1569||it was husbands who had left home in time to stop by this Saint Nicholas Avenue house before they went on to work
LAFB-1570||of course not the same ones everyday but always enough of them to make up the rush and it included white men who would come and cabs all the way up from downtown
LAFB-1571||domineering complaining demanding wives who adjust about psychologically castrated their husbands were responsible for the early Rush
LAFB-1572||these wives were so disagreeable and had made their men so tense that they were robbed at the satisfaction of being men
LAFB-1573||to escape this tension and the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife each of these men had gotten up early to come to a prostitute
LAFB-1574||the prostitutes had to make it their business to be students of men
LAFB-1575||they said that after most men passed their beer out twenties they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos and because a lot of women don't understand it that way they damaged and wreck a man's ego
LAFB-1576||no matter how little virility a man has to offer
LAFB-1577||prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in the world
LAFB-1578||that's why these prostitutes have that morning Rush your business
LAFB-1579||more wives could keep their husbands if they realize their greatest urge is to be men
LAFB-1580||those women would tell me anything funny little stories about the bedroom differences they saw between white and black men the perversity
LAFB-1581||I thought I had heard the whole range of perversity until I later became a steerer taking white men to what they want
LAFB-1582||everyone in the house laughed about the little Italian fellow whom they called the $10 a minute man
LAFB-1583||he came without fail every noontime from his little basement restaurant up near the Polo Grounds
LAFB-1584||the joke was he never lasted more than 2 minutes but he always left $20
LAFB-1585||most men the prostitutes felt were too easy to push around
LAFB-1586||everyday these prostitutes heard their customers complaining that they never heard anything but griping from women who were being taken care of and given everything
LAFB-1587||The Prostitute said that most men needed to know what The Pimps new
LAFB-1588||a woman should have Cajun Ali be babied enough to show her the man had affection but beyond that she should be treated firmly
LAFB-1589||these tough women said that it worked with them
LAFB-1590||all women by their nature are fragile and weak they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength
LAFB-1591||from time to time Sophia would come over to see me from Boston
LAFB-1592||even among Harlem Negroes her looks gave me status
LAFB-1593||they were just like the Negroes everywhere else that was why the white prostitutes made so much money it didn't make any difference if you were in Lansing Boston or New York what the white racist said and still says was right in those days
LAFB-1594||all you had to do is put a white girl anywhere close to the average black man and he would respond the black woman also made The White Man's eyes light up but he was slick enough to hide it
LAFB-1595||sopapillas with come in on a late afternoon train she would come to Smalls and I'd introduce her around until I got off from work
LAFB-1596||she was bothered about me living among the prostitutes until I introduced her to some of them and they talked and she thought they were great
LAFB-1597||they would tell her that they were keeping me straight for her
LAFB-1598||we would go to the Braddock Hotel bar where we would meet some of the musicians who would now greet me like an old friend a red who have we got here
LAFB-1599||they would make a big deal over her I couldn't even think about buying a drill
LAFB-1600||no Negroes in the world where more white woman crazy and knows days than most of those musicians
LAFB-1601||people in Show Business of course with less inhibited by social and racial taboos
LAFB-1602||the white racist won't tell you that it also works in reverse
LAFB-1603||when it got late Sophia and I would go to some of the after hour places and speakeasies
LAFB-1604||when the downtown nightclubs are closed most of these Harlem places crawled with white people
LAFB-1605||these whites were just mad for negro atmosphere especially some of the places which had what you might call Negros soul
LAFB-1606||sometimes Negroes would talk about how a lot of white seemed unable to have enough of being closed around us and Among Us in groups most white men and women it seemed would get almost mesmerized by Negroes
LAFB-1607||I remember one really peculiar case of this a white girl who never missed a single night in the Savoy Ballroom
LAFB-1608||cheap fascinated my friend Sammy he had watch her several times dancing only with Negroes she seemed to go nearly into a trance
LAFB-1609||if a white man asked her to dance she would refuse
LAFB-1610||then when the place was ready to close early in the morning she would let a negro take her as far as the subway entrance and that was it
LAFB-1611||she never would tell anyone her name let alone reveal where she lived
LAFB-1613||whenever they see a negro man on close terms with a white woman
LAFB-1614||a few of the white men around Harlem younger ones when we called
LAFB-1615||movies acted more negro the Negroes this particular one talk more hip talk than we did he would have fought anyone who suggested he felt any race difference
LAFB-1616||musicians around the Braddock could hardly move without falling over him every time I saw him it was Daddy come on let's get out here
LAFB-1617||Sammy couldn't stand him he was underfoot everywhere you went he even wore a wild Zoot Suit used heavy grease in his hair to make it look like a conch and he wore the knob toed shoes the long swinging chain everything
LAFB-1618||and he not only wouldn't be seen with any woman but a black one but in fact he lived with two of them in the same little
LAFB-1619||I never was sure how they work that one out but I had my idea
LAFB-1620||about three or four one morning we ran into this white boy and creole Bill Speakeasy he was high in that marijuana glow where the world relaxes I introduce Sophia
LAFB-1621||I want a way to say hello to someone else when I returned Sofia look peculiar but she wouldn't tell me until we left
LAFB-1622||he had asked her why is it white girl like you throwing yourself away with a spade
LAFB-1623||Creole Bill naturally you know he was from New Orleans became another good friend of mine
LAFB-1624||after Smalls closed I bring fast spending white people who still wanted some drinking action to Creole Bill speakeasy
LAFB-1625||that was my earliest experience it's tearing
LAFB-1626||the Speakeasy was only Creole bills apartment I think a partition had been knocked out to make the living room larger but the atmosphere plus the food made the place one of Harlem Soul spots
LAFB-1627||a record player maintain the right soft music there was any kind of drink and build sold plates of his spicy delicious Creole dishes gumbo jambalaya
LAFB-1628||Bill's girlfriend a beautiful black girl serve the customers bill called her brown sugar and finally everyone else did
LAFB-1629||if a good number of customers were to be served at one time Creole Belle would bring out some pots brown sugar would bring the plates and Bill would serve everyone big plate. And he pup plate for himself and eat with us
LAFB-1630||it was a treat to watch him eat he loved his food so
LAFB-1631||it was good bill could cook rice like the Chinese I mean rice that stood every Grain on its own but I never knew the Chinese to do what bill could do with seafood and beans
LAFB-1632||bill made enough money in that apartment Speakeasy to open up a Creole restaurant famous in Harlem
LAFB-1633||he was a great baseball fan all over the walls were framed autographed photographs of Major League stars and also some political and show business
LAFB-1634||celebrities who would come there to eat bringing friends
LAFB-1635||I wonder what's become a creole bill is place is sold and I haven't heard anything of him
LAFB-1636||I must remember to ask some of the Seventh Avenue Old-Timers Who would know
LAFB-1637||once when I called Sofia and Boston she said she couldn't get away until the following weekend she had just married some well-to-do Boston white fellow
LAFB-1638||he was in the service he had been home on leave and he had just gone back she didn't mean it to change a thing between us I told her it made no difference
LAFB-1639||I had of course introduced Sophia to my friend Sammy and we had gone out together some nights
LAFB-1640||and Sammy and I had thoroughly discussed the black man and white woman psychology
LAFB-1641||I had Sammy to think that I was entirely prepared for Sophia's marriage
LAFB-1642||Sammy said that white women were very practical he had heard so many of them Express how they felt
LAFB-1643||they knew that the black man had all the strikes against him that the white man kept the black man down under his heel unable to get anywhere really
LAFB-1644||white woman wanted to be comfortable she wanted to be looked upon with favor by her own kind but also she wanted to have her pleasure
LAFB-1645||so some of them just married a white man for convenience and security and kept right on going with a negro it wasn't that they were necessarily in love with the Negro but they were in love with lust particularly taboo lust
LAFB-1646||a white man was not too unusual if he had a 10 20 30 40 or $50,000 a year job
LAFB-1647||a negro man who made even $5,000 in the white man's world was unusual
LAFB-1648||the white woman was a negro man would be with him for one of two reasons either extremely insane love or to satisfy her lust
LAFB-1649||when I had been found Harlem long enough to show signs of permanents inevitably I got a nickname that would identify me Beyond any confusion with two other red conked and well-known Reds who were around
LAFB-1650||I had met them both in fact later on I'd work with them both
LAFB-1651||1st Louis red was a professional armed robbery
LAFB-1652||when I was sent to prison he was serving time for trying to stick up a dining car Steward on a train between New York and Philadelphia
LAFB-1653||it was finally freed now I hear he is in prison for a New York City Jewel robbery
LAFB-1654||the other was Chicago Red we became good buddies in the Speakeasy where later on I was a waiter Chicago Red was the funniest dishwasher on this Earth
LAFB-1655||now he's making his living being funny as a nationally-known stage and Nightclub comedian
LAFB-1656||I don't see any reason why Old Chicago Redwood mind me telling
LAFB-1657||but he is Redd Foxx anyway before long my nickname happened just when I don't know but people knowing I was from Michigan would ask me what city
LAFB-1658||since most New Yorkers have never heard of Lansing I would name Detroit
LAFB-1659||gradually I began to be called detroit.red and it's stuck
LAFB-1660||one afternoon in early 1943 before the regular 6 crowded gathered
LAFB-1661||a black soldier set drinking by himself at one of my tables
LAFB-1662||he must have been there an hour or more he looks dumb and pitiful and just up from the deep south
LAFB-1663||the fourth or fifth drink I serve this Soldier wiping the table I bent over close and asked him if he wanted a woman
LAFB-1664||I knew better it wasn't only Smalls Paradise law
LAFB-1665||it was the law of every Tavern that wanted to stay in business never get involved with anything that could be interpreted as
LAFB-1666||impairing the morals of servicemen or any kind of hustling off them
LAFB-1667||visit cause trouble for dozens of places some have been put off limits by the military some had lost their state or city licenses
LAFB-1668||I played right into the hands of a military spy
LAFB-1669||he sure would like a woman he acted so grateful he even put on an extreme southern accent and I gave him the phone number of one of my best friends among the prostitutes where I live
LAFB-1670||but something felt wrong I gave the fellow a half an hour to get there and then I telephoned I expected the answer I got that no Soldier had been there
LAFB-1671||I didn't even bother to go back out to the bar I just went straight to Charlie Smalls his office
LAFB-1672||I just did something Charlie I said I don't know why I did it and I told him
LAFB-1673||Charlie looked at me I wish you hadn't done that red
LAFB-1674||we both knew what he meant when the West Indian plainclothes Detective Joe Baker came in I was waiting I didn't even ask him any questions
LAFB-1675||when we got to the 135th Street precinct it was busy with police in uniform and MP's with soldiers in tow
LAFB-1676||I was recognized by some other detective school like Joe Baker sometimes dropped in its malls
LAFB-1677||two things worried in my favor I'd never given the police any trouble and when that black spy Soldier had tried to tip me I had waves it away telling him that I was just doing him a favor
LAFB-1678||they must have agreed that Joe Baker should just scare me
LAFB-1679||I didn't know enough to be aware that I wasn't taken to the desk and booked
LAFB-1680||Joe Baker took me back inside of the precinct building into a small room
LAFB-1681||in the Next Room we could hear somebody getting whipped why he cry out
LAFB-1682||please please don't beat my face that's how I make my living
LAFB-1683||I knew from that it was some pimp what that please please
LAFB-1684||not much later I heard that Joe Baker had gotten trapped over in New Jersey shaking down a negro pimp and his wife prostitute he was discharged from the New York City Police Force the state of New Jersey convicted him and he went off to do some time
LAFB-1685||more bitter than getting fired I was barred from Smalls
LAFB-1686||I could understand even if I wasn't actually what was called hot I was now going to be under surveillance and the small Brothers had to protect their business
LAFB-1687||Sammy proved to be my friend in need
LAFB-1688||he put the word on the wire for me to come over to his place
LAFB-1689||I have never been there is Place seemed to me a small Palace
LAFB-1690||is women really kept him in style why we talked about what kind of hustle I should get into
LAFB-1691||he gave me some of the best marijuana I'd ever used
LAFB-1692||various numbers controllers Smalls regulars had offered me jobs as a runner but that men I would earn very little until I could build up a clientele
LAFB-1693||pimping is Sammy did was out I felt I had no abilities in that direction and that I'd certainly starve to death trying to recruit prostitutes
LAFB-1694||Bentley reefers Sammy Anaya pretty soon agreed was the best thing
LAFB-1695||it was a relatively uninvolved Lone Wolf type of operation and one in which I could make money immediately
LAFB-1696||for anyone with even a little brains no experience with needed especially if one had any neck at all with people
LAFB-1698||if I later wanted to graduate to them
LAFB-1699||that would be more risky but also more money
LAFB-1700||handling heroin and cocaine could earn one hundreds of dollars a day but it required a lot of experience with the narcotics squad for one to be able to last long enough to make anything
LAFB-1701||I've been around long enough either to know or to spot instinctively most regular detectives and cops though not the narcotics people
LAFB-1702||and among the smalls veteran Hustler regulars I had a variety of potentially helpful contacts
LAFB-1703||this was important because just as Sammy could get me supplied with marijuana a large facet of any Hustler success was knowing where he could get help when he needed it
LAFB-1704||the help could involve police and detectives as well as higher-ups but I hadn't yet reach that stage
LAFB-1705||so Sammy staked me about $20 I think it was
LAFB-1706||later that same night I knocked at his door and gave him back his money and asked him if I could lend him some
LAFB-1707||I don't straight from Sammy's to A supplier he had mentioned I got just a small amount of marijuana and I got some of the paper to roll up my own sticks
LAFB-1709||and every band at least half of the musicians smoke reefers
LAFB-1710||I'm not going to list names I'd have to include some of the most prominent than in popular music even a number of them around today
LAFB-1711||in one case every man and one of the Bands which is still famous was on marijuana
LAFB-1712||Oregon any number of musicians could tell you
LAFB-1713||what I mean when I say that one of the most famous singers smoked his reefers through a chicken thigh bone
LAFB-1714||it smoked so many through the bone that he could just light a match before the empty bone draw the heat through and get what he called a contact high
LAFB-1716||suddenly now I was DePere of the other young Hustlers I had in mind
LAFB-1717||it was at this time that I discovered the movies sometimes I made as many as five and one day both downtown and in Harlem
LAFB-1718||I love the tough guys action Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca and I loved all that dancing and carrying on in such films as Stormy Weather and cabin in the sky
LAFB-1719||after leaving the movies I make my connections for supplies then roll my sticks and about dark-eyed start my rounds
LAFB-1720||I'd give a couple of extra sticks when someone bought 10 which was $5 worth
LAFB-1721||and I didn't sell and run because my customers were my friends Austin I'd smoke along with him
LAFB-1723||she wasn't the same old Ella she still haven't forgiven me for Laura she never mentioned her nor did I but even so Ella acted better than she had when I had left for New York
LAFB-1724||we reviewed the family changes Wilfred had proved so good at his trade they had asked him to stay on at Wilberforce as an instructor and Ella had gotten the card from Reginald who had managed to get into the Merchant Marine
LAFB-1725||from Shorty's apartment I called Sofia she met me at the apartment just about it shorty went off to work
LAFB-1726||I would have liked to take her out to some of the Roxbury clubs but shorty had told us that as in New York the Boston cops use the war as an excuse to harass interracial couples stopping them and Grilling the Negro about his draft status
LAFB-1727||of course Sophie is now being married made us more cautious to
LAFB-1728||when Sofia caught a cab home I want to hear Shorty's band Yes he had a band now
LAFB-1729||he had succeeded in getting a 4-f classification
LAFB-1730||and I was pleased for him and happy to go his band was well there but shorty was making out well and bought
LAFB-1731||playing in small clubs back in the apartment we talked into the next day
LAFB-1732||homeboy you something else shorty kept saying
LAFB-1733||I told him some of the wild things I've done in Harlem and about the friends I've had
LAFB-1734||I told him the story of Sammy the pimp in Sammy's native Paducah Kentucky
LAFB-1735||he'd gotten the girl pregnant her parents made it so hot that Sammy had to come to Harlem where he got a job as a restaurant waiter
LAFB-1736||what a woman came in to eat alone and he found she really was alone not married or living with somebody it generally was not hard for smooth Sammy to get invited to her apartment
LAFB-1737||he'd insist on going out to a nearby restaurant to bring back some dinner and while he was out he would have her key duplicated then when he knew she was away Sammy would go in and clean out all her valuables
LAFB-1738||Sammy was then able to offer some little steak to help her back on her
LAFB-1739||this could be the beginning of an emotional and financial dependency which Sammy knew how to develop until she was his virtual slave
LAFB-1740||around Harlem the narcotics Squad detectives didn't take long to find out I was selling reefers and occasionally one of them would follow me
LAFB-1741||many a peddler was in jail because he had been caught with the evidence on his person I figured a way to avoid that
LAFB-1742||the law specified that is the evidence wasn't actually in your possession you couldn't be arrested
LAFB-1743||hollowed out shoe heels fake hat Linings these things were old stuff to the detectives
LAFB-1744||I carried about 50 sticks and a small package inside my coat under my armpit keeping my arm flat against my side
LAFB-1745||moving about I kept my eyes open if anybody looks suspicious I'd quickly cross the street or go through a door or turn a corner loosening my arm enough to let the package
LAFB-1746||at night when I usually did my selling any suspicious person wouldn't be likely to see the trick
LAFB-1747||if I decided I have been mistaken I go back and get my sticks
LAFB-1748||however I lost many a stick this way sometimes I knew I had frustrated attractive and I kept out of the Courts
LAFB-1749||one morning no I came in and found signs that my room had been entered I knew it had been detective I'd heard too many times out if they couldn't find any evidence they would plant somewhere you would never find it then they come back in and find
LAFB-1750||I didn't even have to think twice what to do I packed my few belongings and never look back when I went to sleep again it was in another room
LAFB-1751||it was then that I began carrying a little 25 automatic
LAFB-1752||I got it for some reefers from an addict who I knew had stolen it somewhere
LAFB-1753||I carried it breast under my belt right down the center of my back
LAFB-1754||someone had told me that cops never hit their in any routine patting down
LAFB-1755||and unless I knew who I was with I never allowed myself to get caught in any Crush of people
LAFB-1756||the narcotics cops have been known to rush up and get their hands on you and plant evidence while searching
LAFB-1757||I felt it as long as I kept on the go and then the open I had a good chance
LAFB-1758||I don't know now what my real thoughts were about carrying the pistol
LAFB-1759||but I imagine that I felt that I wasn't going to get put away if somebody tried framing me in any situation that I could help
LAFB-1760||I sold less than before because having to be so careful consume so much time every now and then on a hunch I moved to another room I told nobody but Sammy where I slept
LAFB-1761||finally it was on The Wire that the Harlem narcotics Squad had me on its special list
LAFB-1762||now every other day or so usually in some public place
LAFB-1763||Flash the badge to search me but I'd tell them it was loud enough for other standing about to hear me that I had nothing on me and I didn't want to get anything planted on me
LAFB-1764||then they wouldn't because Harlem already thought the little enough of the law and they did have to be careful that some crowd of negroes would not intervene roughly
LAFB-1765||Negroes were starting to get very tense in Harlem
LAFB-1766||one could almost Smell Trouble ready to break out as it did very soon
LAFB-1767||but it was really tough on me then I was having to hide my sticks and various places near where I was selling
LAFB-1768||I put five sticks in an empty cigarette pack and drop the empty looking pack by a Lamppost or behind a garbage can or a box and I'd first tell customers to pay me and then where to pick up
LAFB-1769||but my regular customers didn't go for that
LAFB-1770||you couldn't expect a well-known musician to go grubbing behind a garbage can
LAFB-1771||so I began to pick up some of the street trade the people you could see look high
LAFB-1772||I collected the number of empty Red Cross bandage boxes and use them for drops that were pretty good
LAFB-1773||but the middle Harlem narcotics Force found so many ways to harass me that I had to change my area
LAFB-1774||I move down to lower Harlem around 110th Street
LAFB-1775||there were many more reefer smokers around there but these were a cheaper type this was the worst of the ghetto the poorest people the ones who and every ghetto keep themselves narcotized to keep from having to face their miserable existence
LAFB-1776||I didn't last long down there either I lost too much of my product
LAFB-1777||after I sold to some of those reefers smokers who got the instincts of animals they followed me and learned my pattern
LAFB-1778||they would dart out of a doorway I dropped my stuff and they would be on it like a chicken on corn
LAFB-1779||when you becoming animal of vulture in the the ghetto as I had become you enter a world of animals and vultures
LAFB-1780||it becomes truly the survival of only the fittest
LAFB-1781||soon I found myself borrowing little steaks from Sammy from some of the musicians enough to buy supplies enough to keep High myself enough sometimes to just eat
LAFB-1782||then Sammy gave me an idea
LAFB-1783||you still got your old railroad identification I did have it they hadn't taken it back
LAFB-1784||will why don't you use it to make a few runs until the heat cools
LAFB-1785||he was right I found that if you walked up and show the railroad lines employee identification card the conductor even a real cracker if you approached him right not begging would just wave you aboard
LAFB-1786||and when he came around he would punch you one of those little coach seats lips to ride wherever the train
LAFB-1787||went the idea came to me that this way I could travel all over the East Coast selling reefers among my friends who were on tour with their bands
LAFB-1788||I had the New Haven identification I worked a couple of weeks for other railroads to get their identification and then I was set
LAFB-1789||in New York I rolled and packed the great quantity of sticks and seal them into jars the identification card worked perfectly
LAFB-1790||if you persuaded the conductor you were a fellow employee who had to go home on some family business he just did the favor for you without a second thought
LAFB-1791||most whites didn't give a negro credit for having sense enough to fool them or nerve enough
LAFB-1792||I turn up in towns where my friends were playing
LAFB-1793||I was an old friend from home in the sticks I was somebody from the Braddock Hotel
LAFB-1794||my man 3000 and I had Big Apple reefers
LAFB-1795||nobody'd ever heard of a traveling reefer Peddler
LAFB-1796||I followed no particular band each bands musicians knew the other bands one-nighter touring schedules when I ran out of supplies I'd return to New York and load up then hit the road again
LAFB-1797||auditoriums or gymnasiums all lighted up
LAFB-1798||the band's charter bus outside the dressed up excited local dancers pouring in
LAFB-1799||at the door I denounce that I was some band Man's brother and most cases they thought I was one of the musicians
LAFB-1800||throughout the dance I'd show the country folk some plain and fancy Lindy hopping sometimes I stay overnight in the town sometimes I'd ride the band's bus to their next stop sometimes back in New York I would stay awhile
LAFB-1801||things at cooldown word was around
LAFB-1802||I left town and the narcotics Squad was satisfied with that
LAFB-1803||in some of the small town people thinking I was with the band even mob me for autographs once in Buffalo my suit was nearly torn off
LAFB-1804||my brother Reginald was waiting for me one day when I pulled into New York
LAFB-1805||the day before his merchant ship had put into Port over in New Jersey
LAFB-1806||thinking I still work at Small's Reginald have gone there and the bartenders had directed him to Sammy who put him up
LAFB-1807||it felt good to see my brother it was hard to believe that he was once the little kid who tagged after me
LAFB-1808||Reginald now was almost 6 ft tall but still a few inches shorter than me
LAFB-1809||his complexion was darker than mine but he had greenish eyes and a white streak in his hair which was otherwise dark reddish something like mine
LAFB-1810||I took Reginald everywhere introducing him
LAFB-1811||studying my brother I like them
LAFB-1812||he was a lot more self-possessed than I had been at 16
LAFB-1813||I didn't have a room right at the time but I had some money so did Reginald and we checked into the Saint Nicholas Hotel on Sugar Hill
LAFB-1814||it has since been torn down Reginald and I talked all night about the Lansing years about our family I told him things about our father and mother that he couldn't remember
LAFB-1815||Ben Reginald filled me in on our brothers and sisters
LAFB-1816||Wilfred was still a trade instructor at Wilberforce University Hilda still living in Lansing was talkin of getting married so was filled
LAFB-1817||Reginald and I wear the next two in line and Yvonne Wesley and Robert were still in Lansing in school
LAFB-1818||Reginald and I laughed about filbert who the last time I had seen him had gotten deeply religious he wore one of those round straw hats
LAFB-1819||Reginald ship was in for about a week getting some kind of repairs on its engines
LAFB-1820||I was pleased to see that Reginald oh he said little about it at mired my living by my wits
LAFB-1821||Reginald rest a little too loudly I thought I got a reefer customer of mine to get him a more conservative overcoat and suit
LAFB-1822||I told Reginald what I had learned that in order to get something you had to look as though you already had something
LAFB-1823||before Reginald left ironed him to leave the Merchant Marine and I would help him get started in Harlem
LAFB-1824||I must have felt that having my kid brother around me would be a good thing then there would be 2 people I could trust
LAFB-1825||Sammy was the other Reginald was cool at his age I would have been willing to run behind the train to get to New York at the Harlem but Reginald said when he left
LAFB-1826||I'll think about it not long after resin
LAFB-1827||left I dragged out the wildest zoot suit in New York this was 1943
LAFB-1828||the Boston draft board had written me at Ellis and when they had no result there had notified the New York draft board and in care of Sammy I received Uncle Sam greetings
LAFB-1829||in those days only three things in the world scared me jail a job and the army
LAFB-1830||I had about 10 days before I was to show up at the end unction Center I went right to work
LAFB-1831||the Army intelligence soldiers those black spies in civilian clothes hung around in Harlem with their ears open for the white man downtown I knew exactly where to start dropping the word I started noising around that I was frantic to join
LAFB-1832||the Japanese Army when I sent that I have the ears of the spies I would talk and ask hide crazy
LAFB-1833||a lot of the Harlem Hustlers actually had reach that state as I would later
LAFB-1834||it was inevitable when one had gone long enough on heavier and heavier narcotics and under the steadily tightening Vice of the hustling life
LAFB-1835||I'd snatch out read my greetings allowed to make certainly at her who I was and when I'd report downtown
LAFB-1836||this was probably the only time I real name was ever heard in Harlem in those days
LAFB-1837||the day I went down there I costumes like an actor with my wild zoot suit I wore the yellow knob toe shoes and I frizzled my hair up into a reddish bushel skunk
LAFB-1839||they had their wire on me from Uptown all right but they still
LAFB-1841||most of them were white of course the tender looking ones appeared ready to run from me some others had that vinegary worst kind of Niger look and a few were amused seeing me is the Harlem jigaboo archetype
LAFB-1842||also amused with some of the rooms 10 or 12 Negroes but the stony-faced rest of them looked as if they were ready to sign up to go off killing somebody they would have liked to start with me
LAFB-1843||the line moved the law pretty soon strip to my shorts I was making my eager to join comments in the medical examination rooms and everybody in the white coats that I saw
LAFB-1844||had 4f in his eyes I stayed in the line longer than I expected before they siphoned be off
LAFB-1845||one of the white coats accompanied me around the Turning hallway
LAFB-1846||I knew we were on the way to a headshrinker the Army psychiatrist
LAFB-1847||the receptionist there was a negro nurse I remember she was in her early twenties and not bad to look at
LAFB-1849||you couldn't read the Negro press for the big pictures of Smaug black firsts
LAFB-1850||somebody was inside with the psychiatrist I didn't even have to put on any act for this black girl she was already sick of me
LAFB-1851||when finally abuzz came at her desk she didn't send me she went in
LAFB-1852||I knew what she was doing she was going to make clear in advance what she thought of me
LAFB-1853||this is still one of the black man's big troubles today
LAFB-1854||so many of these so-called upper-class Negroes are so busy trying to impress on the white man that they are different from those others that they can't see they are only helping the white man to keep his low opinion of all Negroes
LAFB-1855||and then with her prestige in the clear she came out and nodded to me to go in
LAFB-1856||I must say this for that psychiatrist he tried to be objective and professional in his manner
LAFB-1857||he sat there and doodled with his blue pencil on a tablet listening to me Speidel to him for three or four minutes before he got to word in
LAFB-1858||his tack was quiet questions to get it why I was so anxious I didn't rush
LAFB-1859||I circled in hedge watching him closely to let him think he was pulling what he wanted out of me
LAFB-1860||I kept jerking around backward as though somebody might be listening
LAFB-1861||I knew I was going to send him back to the books to figure out what kind of case I was
LAFB-1862||suddenly I sprang up and peeped under both doors the one-eyed entered and another that probably was a closet and then I bent them whispered fast in his ear
LAFB-1863||Daddy-o now you and me we're from up North here so don't you tell nobody I want to get sent down south organized them niggars soldiers you did steal us some guns and kill us some crackers
LAFB-1864||that psychiatrist blue pencil dropped and his professional manner fell off and all directions
LAFB-1865||he stared at me as if I were a snake's egg hatching fumbling for his red pencil I knew I had him
LAFB-1866||I was going back out past Miss first when he said that will be all
LAFB-1867||a 4-f card came to me in the mail and I never heard from the Army anymore and never bothered to ask why I was rejected
LAFB-1869||negro railroad men waited for their trains in their big locker room on the lower level of Grand Central Station
LAFB-1870||big Blackjack and poker games went on in there around the clock
LAFB-1871||sometimes $500 would be on the table
LAFB-1872||one day in a blackjack game and old cook who was dealing the cards tried to be slick and I had to drop my pistol in his face
LAFB-1873||the next time I went into one of those games intuition told me to stick my gun under my belt right down the middle of my back
LAFB-1874||sure enough someone it squealed
LAFB-1875||two big beefy faced Irish cop came in
LAFB-1876||they frisked me and they missed my gun where they hadn't expected
LAFB-1877||the cops told me never again to be caught in Grand Central Station unless I had a ticket to ride somewhere
LAFB-1878||and I knew that by the next day every railroads personnel office would have a black ball on me so I never tried to get another railroad job
LAFB-1879||there I was back in Harlem streets among all the rest of the hustlers I couldn't sell reefers the dope Squad detectives were too familiar with me I was a true Hustler uneducated unskilled at anyting honorable and I considered myself nervy
LAFB-1880||and cunning enough to live by my wits exploiting any prey that presented itself I would risk just about anything
LAFB-1881||right now in every Big City ghetto tens of thousands of yesterday's and today's school dropouts are keeping Body and Soul together by some form of hustling in the same way I did
LAFB-1882||and they inevitably move into more and more worse and worse illegality and immorality
LAFB-1883||full-time Hustlers never can relax to appraise what they are doing and where they are bound
LAFB-1885||during the next six to eight months I pulled my first robberies and stick ups only small ones always in other nearby cities and I got a way
LAFB-1886||as the pros did I too would keep myself to pull these jobs by my first use of harddope I began with Sammy's recommendations sniffing cocaine
LAFB-1887||normally now for Street where I might call it I carried a hardly noticeable little flat blue steel 25 automatic but for working
LAFB-1888||I carried a 32 or 38 or 45
LAFB-1889||I saw how when the eyes stared at the big black hole the faces fell slacking the mouth sagged open and when I spoke the people seem to hear as though they were far away and they would do whatever I ask
LAFB-1890||between jobs staying high on narcotics kept me from getting nervous still upon sudden impulses just to play safe
LAFB-1891||I would have broccoli move from one to another 15 to $20 a week room always in my favorite one
LAFB-1892||hundred 47th 150th Street area just flanking Sugar Hill
LAFB-1893||once on a job with Sammy we had a pretty close call someone must have seen us we were making our getaway running when we heard the siren instantly we slowed to walking
LAFB-1894||as a police car screeched to a stop we stepped out into the street meeting it hailing it to ask for directions
LAFB-1895||they must have thought we were about to give them some information they just cursed us and raced on again it didn't cross the white men's Minds that a trick like that might be pulled on them by Negroes
LAFB-1896||the suits that I wore the finest I bought hot for about 35 to $50
LAFB-1897||I made it my rule never to go after more than I needed to live on
LAFB-1898||any experienced Housley will tell you that getting greedy is the quickest road to prison
LAFB-1899||I kept taste in my head vulnerable places and situations and I would perform the next job
LAFB-1900||only when my bankroll in my pocket began to get too low
LAFB-1901||some weeks I bet large amounts on the numbers
LAFB-1902||I still played with the same Runner with whom I'd started and Smalls Paradise
LAFB-1903||laying my hunches many a day I'd have up to $40 on two numbers hoping for that fabulous 602 one payoff
LAFB-1904||but I never did hit a big number full board
LAFB-1905||there's no telling what I might have done if I'd landed $10,000 or $12,000 at one time
LAFB-1906||of course once in awhile I hit a small combination figure
LAFB-1907||sometimes flush like that I'd telephone Sophia to come over from Boston for a couple of days
LAFB-1908||I went to the movies a lot again and I never miss my musician friends whenever they were playing either in Harlem downtown at the big theaters or on 52nd Street
LAFB-1909||Reginald and I got very close the next time his ship came back into New York
LAFB-1910||we discussed our family and what is she
LAFB-1911||it was that our book-loving oldest brother Wilfred had never had the chance to go to some of those big universities where he would have gone far
LAFB-1912||and we exchanged thought we had never shared with anyone
LAFB-1913||Reginald in his quiet way was a mad fan of musicians and music
LAFB-1914||when his ship sailed one morning without him a principal reason was that I had thoroughly exposed him to the exciting musical world
LAFB-1915||we had wild X backstage with the musicians when they were playing the Roxy or the Paramount
LAFB-1916||after selling reefers with the bands as they travel I was known to almost every popular Negro musician around New York in 1944 or 1945
LAFB-1917||Reginald and I went to the Savoy Ballroom the Apollo Theater the Braddock Hotel bar the night clubs and speakeasies wherever Negroes played music
LAFB-1918||the great lady day Billie Holiday hugged him and called him baby brother
LAFB-1919||Reginald shared tens of thousands of negroes feelings that The Living End of the big bands was Lionel Hampton
LAFB-1920||I was very close to many of the men and a band I introduced Reginald to them and also to Hampton self and hats wife and business manager Gladys Hampton
LAFB-1921||one of this world's sweetest people is Hamp
LAFB-1922||anyone who knows him will tell you that he'd often do the most generous things or people he barely knew
LAFB-1923||as much money as happy as made and still makes he would be broke today if his money in his business weren't handled by Gladys who is one of the brainiest women I ever met
LAFB-1924||the Apollo Theater Zona Frank shipment could tell you
LAFB-1925||he generally signed bands to play for a set weekly amount but I know that once during those days Gladys Hampton instead of range the deal for hams band to play for a cut of the gate
LAFB-1926||then the usual number of shows was doubled up if I'm not mistaken eight shows a day instead of the usual 4 and hams pulling power cleaned up
LAFB-1927||Gladys Hampton used to talk to me a lot and she tried to give me good advice come down
LAFB-1928||Gladys saw how Wild I was she saw me headed daughter bad end
LAFB-1929||one of the things I liked about Reginald was that when I left him to go away working Reginald to ask me no questions
LAFB-1930||after he came to Harlem I went on more jobs than usual
LAFB-1931||I guess that one influence me to get my first actual apartment with my not wanting Reginald to be knocking around Harlem without anywhere to call home
LAFB-1933||with the apartment as our headquarters I gradually got Reginald introduced around to Creole bills and other Harlem after hours spots
LAFB-1934||about 2 every morning as the downtown white night clubs closed Reginald and I would stand around in front of this or that Harlem after-hours place and I've School into what was happening
LAFB-1935||especially after the night clubs downtown closed the taxis in Black limousines would be driving Uptown bringing those white people who never could get enough of negro soul
LAFB-1937||inside every after-hours spot the smoke would hurt your eyes for white people to every negro would be in their drinking whiskey from coffee cups and eating fried chicken
LAFB-1938||the generally flushed face white men in their makeup mask glitter
LAFB-1939||God women will be pounding each other's backs and uproariously laughing and applauding the music
LAFB-1940||a lot of the wife's drunk would go staggering up to Negroes the waiters the owners or Negroes at tables wringing their hands even trying to hug them you're just as good as I am I want you to know that
LAFB-1941||the most famous places Drew both negro and white celebrities who enjoyed each other
LAFB-1942||a jam-packed 4:30 a.m. crowd at Jimmy's Chicken Shack or Dickie Wells might have such a jam session entertainment is Hazel Scott playing the piano for Billie Holiday singing the blues
LAFB-1943||Jimmy's Chicken Shack incidentally was where once later on I worked briefly as a waiter
LAFB-1944||that's where Red Fox was the dishwasher who kept the kitchen crew in stitches
LAFB-1945||after a while my brother Reginald had to have a Hustle
LAFB-1946||and I gave much thought to what would be for him a good safe Hustle
LAFB-1947||after he'd learned his own way around it would be up to him to take risks for himself
LAFB-1948||if you wanted to make more inquicker money the hustle I got Reginald into
LAFB-1949||really was very simple it utilize the psychology of the ghetto jungle
LAFB-1950||downtown he paid the $2 or whatever it was for a regular City Peddler's license
LAFB-1951||then I took him to a manufacturer's Outlet where we bought our supply of cheap imperfect s shirts underwear cheap rings watches all kinds of quick sale items
LAFB-1952||watching me work this awful back in Harlem Reginald's quickly caught on how to go into barber shops Beauty parlors and bars acting very nervous as he let the customers peep into his small valise of loot
LAFB-1953||with so many things around anxious to get rid of stolen good quality merchandise cheaply many Harlem I purely because of this conditioning jumped to pay hot
LAFB-1954||prices for inferior good to sail was perfectly legitimate
LAFB-1955||it never took long to get rid of a valise fo4 at least twice what it is cost and if any cop stop Reginald he had in his pocket both the Peddler's license and the manufacturers Outlet bills of sale
LAFB-1956||Reginald only had to be certain that none of the customers to whom he sold ever saw that he was legitimate
LAFB-1957||I assumed that Reginald like most of the Negroes I knew would go for a white one
LAFB-1958||I point out negro happy white women to him and explain that a negro with any brains could wrap these women around his fingers
LAFB-1959||but I have to say this for Reginald he never liked white women
LAFB-1960||I remember the one time he met Sophia he was so cool it upset Sophia and it tickled me
LAFB-1961||Reginald got himself a black woman I guess you was pushing through
LAFB-1962||and Old Settlers as we called them back in those days
LAFB-1963||she was a waitress and an exclusive restaurant downtown
LAFB-1964||she lavished on Reginald everything she had
LAFB-1965||she was so happy to get a young man I mean she bought him clothes cooked and wash for him and everything as though he were a baby
LAFB-1966||that was just another example of why my respect for my younger brother kept increasing
LAFB-1967||Reginald showed in often surprising way more sense than a lot of working Hustler twice his age
LAFB-1968||Reginald n was only 16 but a six footer he looked and acted much older than his years
LAFB-1969||all through the war of the Harlem racial picture never was too bright
LAFB-1970||tension built to a pretty high-pitch Old-Timers told me that Harlem had never been the same since the 1935 Riot when millions of dollars worth of damage was done by thousands of negroes
LAFB-1971||furiated chiefly by the white merchants in Harlem refusing to hire a negro even as Ben stores raped in Harlem's money
LAFB-1972||during World War II Marilyn Guardia officially close the Savoy Ballroom
LAFB-1973||Harlem said the real reason was to stop Negroes from dancing with white women Harlem said that no one dragged the white women in there
LAFB-1975||City Hall kept the Savoy closed for a long time
LAFB-1976||it was just another one of those liberal North actions that didn't help Harlem to love the white man any
LAFB-1977||finally rumor flashed that in the Braddock Hotel
LAFB-1978||white cops had shot a Negro Soldier
LAFB-1979||I was walking down Saint Nicholas Avenue I saw all of these Negroes hollering and running North from 125th Street
LAFB-1980||some of them would load it down with armfuls of stuff
LAFB-1981||I remember it was the bandleader Fletcher Henderson's nephew shorty Henderson who told me what it happened
LAFB-1982||Negroes was smashing store windows and taking everything they could grab and carry
LAFB-1983||Furniture food Jewelry close whiskey within an hour every New York City Cop seem to be in Harlem
LAFB-1985||just recently I ran into shorty Henderson on 7th Avenue we were laughing about a fellow whom the riot had left
LAFB-1986||the nickname of left feet in a scramble in a woman shoe store somehow he grabbed five shoes all of them four left feet
LAFB-1987||and we left about the scared little Chinese whose restaurant didn't have a hand laid on it because the rioters just about convulsed laughing when they saw the sign the Chinese and hastily stuck on his front door me colored too
LAFB-1988||after the riot things got very tight in the mall
LAFB-1989||it was terrible for The Nightlife people and for those Hustlers whose main income had been the white man's money
LAFB-1990||the 1935 Riot had left only a relative trickle of the money which had poured into Harlem during the 1920s and now this new ride and did even that trick
LAFB-1991||today the white people who visit Harlem and this mostly on weekend nights are hardly more than a few dozen who do the twist the frug the Watusi and all the
LAFB-1992||best of the current dance crazes and Smalls Paradise on now by the great basketball champion Wilt the stilt Chamberlain who draws crowds with his big clean all American athlete image
LAFB-1993||most white people today a physically afraid to come to Harlem and it's for good reasons to even for Negroes Harlem nightlife is about finished
LAFB-1994||most of the Negroes who have money to spend or spending it downtown somewhere in this hypocritical integration in places where previously the police would have been called to haul off any negro insane enough to try and get in
LAFB-1996||those Rich whites could afford it when they used to throw away their money in Harlem but negros
LAFB-1997||afford to be taking that money downtown to the white man
LAFB-1998||Sammy and I on a robbery job got a bad scare a very close call
LAFB-1999||things have grown so tight and Harlem that some hustlers have been forced to go to work
LAFB-2000||even some prostitutes had gotten jobs as domestics and cleaning out Office Buildings at night
LAFB-2001||the pimping was so poor Sammy had gone on the job with me
LAFB-2002||we had selected one of those situations considered impossible
LAFB-2003||but whenever people think that the gods will unconsciously grow gradually more relaxed until sometime those can be the easiest jobs of all
LAFB-2004||but right in the middle of the ACT we had some bad luck a bullet grazed Sammy we just barely escaped
LAFB-2005||Sammy fortunately wasn't really hurt we split up which was always wise to do
LAFB-2006||just before Daybreak I went to Sammy's apartment his newest woman one of those beautiful but hot-headed Spanish Negroes was in there crying and carrying on over Sammy
LAFB-2007||she went for me screaming and clawing she knew I'd been in on it with him
LAFB-2008||I bended or off not able to figure out why Sammy didn't shut her up I did and from the corner of my eye
LAFB-2010||we soon made up on the surface but things never are fully write again
LAFB-2011||anyone you have seen trying to kill you intuition told us that we had better lay low for a good while
LAFB-2012||the worst thing was that we've been seen the police in that nearby Town had surely circulated our general description
LAFB-2013||I just couldn't forget that incident over Sammy's woman
LAFB-2014||I came to rely more and more upon my brother Reginald is the only one in my world I could completely trust
LAFB-2015||Reginald was lazy I discovered that
LAFB-2016||Ed quit his hustle all together but I didn't mind that really because one could be as lazy as he wanted if he would only use his head as Reginald was doing
LAFB-2017||it left my apartment by now he was living off his Old Settlers woman when he was in town
LAFB-2018||I had also taught Reginald how he could work a little while for a railroad then use his identification card to travel for nothing and Reginald love to travel
LAFB-2019||several times you done visiting all around among our brothers and sisters
LAFB-2020||they had now begun to scatter two different cities
LAFB-2021||in Boston Reginald was closer to our sister Mary then to Ella who have been my favorite most Reginald and Mary will quiet types and Ella and I were extroverts and shorty in Boston had given my brother a royal time
LAFB-2022||because of my reputation it was easy for me to get into the numbers racket
LAFB-2023||that was probably Harlem only hustle which hadn't slumped in business
LAFB-2024||in return for a favor to some white mobster my new boss and his wife are just been given a six-month numbers banking privilege for the Bronx railroad area called Mott Haven yards
LAFB-2025||the white Mobsters had the numbers racket split into specific areas a designated area would be assigned to someone for a specified. Of time
LAFB-2026||my boss's wife at Ben Dutch Schultz his secretary in the 1930s during the time when Schultz headstrong on
LAFB-2027||his way into control of the Harlem numbers business
LAFB-2028||my job now was to ride a bus across the George Washington Bridge where a fellow was waiting for me to hand him a bag of numbers betting slips
LAFB-2029||we never spoke I cross the street and catch the next bus back to Harlem
LAFB-2030||I never knew who that fella was I never knew who picked up the bedding money for the slips that I handled you didn't ask questions in the rackets
LAFB-2031||my boss's wife and Gladys Hampton were the only two women I ever met in Harlem who's business ability I really respected
LAFB-2032||my boss's wife when she had the time and the inclination to talk would tell me many interesting things
LAFB-2033||she would talk to me about the duck show today's about the deals that she had known about graft paid to officials rookie cops and shyster lawyers right on up into the top levels of police and Pieology
LAFB-2034||she knew from personal experience how crime existed only to the degree that the law cooperated with it
LAFB-2035||she showed me how in the country's entire social political and economic structure the criminal the law and the politicians were actually Inseparable partners
LAFB-2036||it was at this time that I change from my old numbers man the one I use since I first working Smalls Paradise he hated to lose a heavy player but he readily understood why I would now want to play with a runner of my own outfit
LAFB-2037||that was how I began placing my bets with West Indian Archie I've mentioned him before one of Harlem's really bad Negroes one of those former Dutch Schultz strong-arm man around Harlem
LAFB-2038||West Indian Archie had finish time in Sing Sing not long before I came to Harlem
LAFB-2040||he was able to file all the numbers in his head and write them down for the banker only when he turned in his money this made him the ideal Runner because cops could never catch him with any betting slips
LAFB-2041||I've often reflected upon such black veteran numbers man as West Indian Archie
LAFB-2042||if they had lived in another kind of society their exceptional mathematical talents might have been better used but they were black
LAFB-2043||anyway it was status just to be known as a client of West Indian arches because he handled only sizable Bettors
LAFB-2044||you also required integrity and Sound Credit
LAFB-2045||it wasn't necessary that you pay as you played Euchre
LAFB-2046||a West Indian what you buy the week he always carried a couple of thousand dollars on him his own money
LAFB-2047||if a client came up to him and said he'd hit for some moderate amount say a $0.50 or $1 combination
LAFB-2048||West Indian Archie with peel-off the 3 or $600 and later get his money back from the banker
LAFB-2050||the six-month finally ended for my boss and his wife they are done well
LAFB-2051||the Run has got nice tips and promptly was snatched up by other bankers
LAFB-2052||I continued working for my boss and his wife and a gambling house they open
LAFB-2053||a harlem Madame I come to know through having done a friend of hers of favor introduced me to a
LAFB-2054||facet of the Harlem Night world something which the riot head only interrupted
LAFB-2055||it was the world we're behind locked doors Negroes catered to moneyed white people's weird sexual tastes
LAFB-2056||the Whiteside known love to rub shoulders publicly with black folks in the after-hours clubs and speakeasies
LAFB-2057||bees on the other hand were whites who did not want it known that they had been anywhere near Harlem
LAFB-2058||the riot had made these exclusive white customers nervous
LAFB-2059||they're slipping into and about Harlem hadn't been so noticeable when other whites were also around
LAFB-2060||but now they would be conspicuous they also feared the recently aroused anger of Harlem Negroes
LAFB-2061||so the Madame was safeguarding her growing operation by offering me a Steelers job
LAFB-2062||during the war it was extremely difficult to get a telephone
LAFB-2063||one day The Madame told me to stay at my apartment the next morning
LAFB-2064||she talked to somebody I don't know who it was but before the next noon I dialed the Madam for my own telephone unlisted
LAFB-2065||this Madame was a specialist in her field if her own girls could not or would not accommodate a customer she would send me to another place
LAFB-2066||usually an apartment somewhere else in Harlem where they requested specialty was done
LAFB-2067||my post for picking up the customers was right outside the Astor hotel that always busy northwest corner of 45th Street and Broadway
LAFB-2068||watching the moving traffic I was soon able to spot the taxi car or limousine even before it slowed down
LAFB-2069||with the anxious white faces peering out for the tall reddish brown complexion negro wearing a dark suit a raincoat with a white flower in his lapel
LAFB-2071||we would get into another cab driven by a black man and I give him the right address
LAFB-2073||with tips which were often heavy sometimes I would make over $100 a night steering up to 10 customers in a party to cm
LAFB-2074||thing to do anything to have anything done to them that they wanted
LAFB-2076||Richmond middle-aged and Beyond men well past their Prime these weren't college boys these were their ivy league father's even grandfather's I guess
LAFB-2078||Harlem was they're sending their fleshpot
LAFB-2079||they stole off among taboo black people and took
LAFB-2080||whatever antiseptic important dignified masks they wore in their white world
LAFB-2081||these were men who could afford to spend large amounts of money for two three or four hours indulging a strange appetites
LAFB-2082||but in this black-white Netherworld nobody judged the customers anything they could name anything they could imagine anything they could describe they could do or could have done to them just as long as they paid
LAFB-2083||in the profumo case in England Christine keeler's friend testified that some of her customers wanted to be with
LAFB-2084||one of my main steers 21 Specialties dress away from the Madam's house
LAFB-2085||was the apartment of a big cold black girl strong as an ox with muscles like a duck workers
LAFB-2086||up on anything it generally was the oldest of these white men in their sixties I know some May
LAFB-2088||some of them would pay me extra to come and watch them being beaten
LAFB-2089||that girl greased-up big amazon body all over the look shiny or Unblocker
LAFB-2090||she use small plaited whips she would draw blood
LAFB-2091||and she was making herself a small fortune off these old white men
LAFB-2092||I wouldn't tell all the things I've seen
LAFB-2093||I used to wonder later on when I was in prison what a psychiatrist would make of it all
LAFB-2094||and so many of those men held responsible positions they exercised guidance influence and authority over others
LAFB-2095||in prison later I think too about another thing
LAFB-2096||just about all of those whites specifically expressed as their preference black black the blacker the better
LAFB-2097||The Madam having long since learned this had in her house nothing but the blackest accommodating women she could find
LAFB-2098||in all of my time and Harlem I never saw a white prostitute touched by a white man
LAFB-2099||white girls were in some of the berries Harlem specialty places
LAFB-2100||they would participate in customers most frequent exhibition request asleep black Negro man having a white woman
LAFB-2101||was this the white man wanting the witnesses deepest sexual fear
LAFB-2102||a few times I even had parties that included white women whom the men had brought with them to watch this
LAFB-2103||I never steered any white women other than in these instances brought by their own men or who had been put into contact with me by a white lesbian whom I knew who was another variety
LAFB-2104||specialty Madame this lesbian a beautiful white woman had a male negro stable
LAFB-2105||her vocabulary was all profanity she supplied negro meals.on order to well-to-do white women
LAFB-2106||I'd seen this lesbian then her blonde girlfriend around Harlem drinking and talkin it bars always with young Negroes
LAFB-2107||no one who didn't know would ever guess that the lesbian was recruiting
LAFB-2108||but one night I gave her and her girlfriend some reefers which they said we're the best they'd ever smoke
LAFB-2109||they lived in a hotel downtown and after that now and then they would call me then I would bring them some reefers and we talk
LAFB-2110||she told me how she had accidentally gotten started in her specialty
LAFB-2111||as a harlem habitue she had known Harlem Negroes who like white women
LAFB-2112||her role developed from a pattern of talk she often her
LAFB-2113||from board well-to-do white women where she worked in an East Side Beauty Salon
LAFB-2114||hearing the women complain about sexually inadequate mates she would tell what she'd heard about negro men
LAFB-2115||observing how excited some of the women seemed to become she finally arrange some dates with some of the Harlem negro she knew at her own apartment
LAFB-2116||eventually she rented 3 Midtown Apartments where a woman customer could meet a negro by appointment
LAFB-2117||our customers recommended her service to their friends she quit the beauty salon set up a Messenger Service as an operating front and ran all of her business by telephone
LAFB-2118||she had also noticed the color preference
LAFB-2119||I could never substitute in an emergency she would tell me where the laugh because I was too light
LAFB-2120||she told me that nearly every white woman in her clientele would specify a black one sometimes they would say
LAFB-2121||a real one meaning black no ground Negroes no red negro
LAFB-2122||the lesbian thought of her Messenger Service idea because some of her trade wanted the Negroes to come to their homes at times carefully arranged by telephone
LAFB-2123||these women lived in neighborhoods of Swank Brownstones and exclusive apartment houses with Dorman dressed like admirals
LAFB-2124||but white society never thinks about challenging any negro in a servant role
LAFB-2125||doorman would telephone up in here oh yes send him right up James
LAFB-2126||service elevators with Speedos neatly dress negro messenger boys right up so they could deliver what had been ordered by some of the most privileged white women in Manhattan
LAFB-2127||the irony is that those white women had no more respect for those Negroes than white men have had for the Negro
LAFB-2128||and they have been using since slavery times and intern
LAFB-2129||Negroes have no respect for the whites they get into bed with I know the way I felt about Sofia who still came to New York whenever I called her
LAFB-2130||the West Indian boyfriend of the profumo Scandal Christine Keeler lucky Gordon and his friends must have felt the same way
LAFB-2132||if Gordon told everything goes white girls told him he would give England a new scandal
LAFB-2133||it's no different from what happens in some of America's top most white circles
LAFB-2134||40 years ago I saw them nightly with my own eyes I heard them
LAFB-2135||with my own ears that hypocritical white man will talk about the Negroes low morals
LAFB-2136||but who has the world's lowest morals if not white and not only that but the upper-class whites
LAFB-2137||recently be Tales were published about a group of suburban New York City White House wives and mothers operating as a professional call girl ring
LAFB-2138||in some cases these wives were out prostituting with the agreement even the cooperation of husband's some of whom even waited at home attending the children
LAFB-2139||and the customers to quote a major New York City morning newspaper
LAFB-2140||some sixteen ledgers and books with names of 200 John many important social financial and political figures were seized in the raid Friday night
LAFB-2141||I have also read recently about groups of young white couples
LAFB-2143||early one morning in Harlem at all light negro wearing a hat and with a woman stocking drawn down over his face held up a negro bartender and manager who were counting up the knights receipts
LAFB-2144||like most bars in Harlem Negroes fronted and the Jew really own the place
LAFB-2145||to get a license one had to know somebody in the state liquor Authority and Jews working with Jews seem to have the best sl-a contacts
LAFB-2146||the black manager hired some negro hoodlums to go hunting for the holdup man and the man's description cause them to include me among their suspects
LAFB-2147||about Daybreak that same morning they kicked in the door of my apartment
LAFB-2148||I told him that I didn't know a thing about it that I hadn't had a thing to do with whatever they were talking about
LAFB-2149||I told them I had been out on my hustle steering until maybe 4 in the morning and then I had come straight to my apartment and gone to bed
LAFB-2150||the strong on thugs were bluffing they were trying to flush out the man who have done it they still had other suspects to check out that's all that saved me
LAFB-2151||I put on my clothes and took a taxi and I woke up to people The Madam then Sammy
LAFB-2152||I had some money but the Madam gave me some more and I told Sammy I was going to see my brother filbert in Michigan
LAFB-2153||I gave Sammy the address so that he can let me know when things got straightened out
LAFB-2154||this was the trip to Michigan in the winter time when I put congelen on my head then discovered that the bathroom sinks pipes were frozen
LAFB-2155||to keep the life from burning up my scalp I had to stick my hair
LAFB-2156||into the stool in flush and flush to rent out the stuff
LAFB-2157||a week passed in frigid Michigan before Sami telegram came
LAFB-2158||another red negro had confessed which enabled me to live in Harlem again
LAFB-2159||but I didn't go back into steering I can't remember why I didn't
LAFB-2160||I imagine I must have felt like staying away from hustling for a while going to some of the clubs at night and narcotizing with my friends
LAFB-2161||anyway I just never went back to the madams job
LAFB-2162||it was at about this time too I remember that I began to be sick I had Kohl's all the time it got to be a steady irritation always sniffing and wiping my nose all day all night
LAFB-2163||I stayed so high that I was in a dream world
LAFB-2164||now sometimes I smoked opium with some white friends actors who live downtown and I smoke more refresh than ever before I didn't smoke the usual wouldn't match size sticks of marijuana I was so far gone by now that I smoked it almost by the ounce
LAFB-2165||after a while I worked downtown for a Jew
LAFB-2166||he liked me because of something I had managed to do for him
LAFB-2167||he bought run down restaurants and bars Jaime was his name
LAFB-2168||he would remodel these places then staged a big gallery opening with banners and a spotlight outside
LAFB-2169||the jam-packed busy place with the big Under New Management sign in the window would attract speculators usually other Jews who are around looking for something to invest money in
LAFB-2170||sometimes even in the week of the new opening Jaime would resell at a good profit
LAFB-2171||Jaime really like me and I liked him he loved to talk I love to listen
LAFB-2173||thought of his Jews read
LAFB-2174||I'm a Jew and you're black you would say these Gentiles don't like either one of us if the Jew wasn't smarter than the Gentile he'd get treated worse than your people
LAFB-2175||Jaime paid me good money while I was with him sometimes 200 and $300 a week
LAFB-2176||I would have done anything for Jaime I did do all kinds of things but my main job was transporting bootleg liquor that Jaime supplied usually to those spruced-up bars which he had sold to someone
LAFB-2177||another fellow and I would drive out to Long Island where a big bootleg whiskey outfit operated
LAFB-2178||we take with us cartons of empty bonded whiskey bottles that were saved illegally by the bars we supplied
LAFB-2179||we would buy 5-gallon containers of bootleg funnel it into the bottles then deliver according to Jaime's instructions this or that many crates back to the bars
LAFB-2180||many people claiming they drink only such and such a brand couldn't tell they're only brand from Pure week old Long Island bootleg
LAFB-2181||most ordinary whiskey drinkers are brand chunks like this
LAFB-2182||on the side with Jaime's approval I was myself at that time supplying some lesser quantities of bootleg to reputable Harlem bars as well as to some of the few speakeasies still in Harlem
LAFB-2183||but one weekend on Long Island something happened involving the state liquor Authority
LAFB-2184||one of New York State's biggest recent scandals has been the exposure of wholesale SL a graft and Corruption
LAFB-2185||in the bootleg racket I was involved in someone high up must have been taken for a real pile
LAFB-2186||a rumor about some inside tipsters spread among Jaime in the others
LAFB-2187||one day Jaime didn't show up where he had told me to meet him
LAFB-2188||I never heard from him again but I did hear that he was put in the ocean and I'm
LAFB-2190||it always made me wonder if that bar stickup had really been solved or if the wrong man had confessed under beatings but anyway the past suspicion of me help to revive suspicion of me again
LAFB-2191||pumping Fat Man's Bar on the hill overlooking the Polo Grounds I had just gone into a telephone booth
LAFB-2193||earlier in the afternoon I have collected from West Indian Archie for a 50 Cent combination bet
LAFB-2194||get paid me $300 right out of his pocket
LAFB-2195||I was telephoning Jean Parks Jean was one of the most beautiful women who ever lived in Harlem
LAFB-2196||she wants sang with Sarah Vaughan in the bluebonnets a quartet that sang was Earl Hines
LAFB-2197||for longtime Gene and I had enjoyed a standing friendly deal that we'd go out and celebrate when either of us get the numbers
LAFB-2198||since my last hit Gene had treated me twice and we laughed on the phone glad that now I'd treat her to a night out
LAFB-2199||we arranged to go to a 52nd Street nightclub to hear Billie Holiday who had been on the road and was just back in New York
LAFB-2200||as I hung up I spotted the two-lane tough-looking Paesano's gazing ended me cooped up in the phone booth
LAFB-2201||I didn't need any intuition and I had no gun
LAFB-2202||a cigarette case was the only thing in my pocket
LAFB-2203||I started easing my hand down into my pocket to try bluffing and one of them snapped open the door
LAFB-2204||they were dark olives were they featured Italians I had my hand down into my pocket
LAFB-2205||come on outside will hold Court once said
LAFB-2206||at that moment a cop walk through the front door
LAFB-2207||the two thugs slipped out I never in my life have been so glad to see a cop
LAFB-2208||I was still shaking when I got to the apartment of my friend Sammy the pimp
LAFB-2209||he told me that not long before West Indian Archie had been there looking for me
LAFB-2210||sometimes we're calling all of this I don't know to tell the truth how I am alive to tell it today
LAFB-2211||they say God takes care of Fools and babies I so often thought that allow was watching over me
LAFB-2212||through all of this time of my life I really was dead mentally dead I just didn't
LAFB-2213||oh that I was anyway to kill time Sammy and I sniffed some of his cocaine until the time came to pick up Jean part to go down and hear Lady Day
LAFB-2214||Sammy's having told me about West Indian Archie looking for me didn't mean a thing
LAFB-2216||read I want my money of 3220 is a funny kind of gun it's bigger than a 32
LAFB-2217||but it's not as big as a 38
LAFB-2218||I face down some dangerous Negroes but no one who wasn't ready to die messed with West Indian Archie
LAFB-2219||I couldn't believe it he truly scared me
LAFB-2220||I was so incredulous at what was happening that it was hard to form words with my brain and my mouth
LAFB-2221||man what's the beef West Indian Archie said he thought I was trying something when I told him I did
LAFB-2222||but he paid me the $300 until he could double-check his written betting slips and as he thought I hadn't combinator the number I've claimed but another
LAFB-2223||Ben you're crazy I talk fast I've seen out of the corner of my eye Sammy's hand easing under his pillow where he kept his Army 45
LAFB-2224||Archie smart a man is you supposed to be you pay somebody who hadn't yet
LAFB-2225||the 3220 moved at the Sammy froze
LAFB-2226||West Indian Archie told him I have to shoot you through the air
LAFB-2227||and then you look back at me you don't have my money
LAFB-2228||I must have shaking my head I'll give you until 12 tomorrow
LAFB-2229||Eddie put his hand behind him and pulled open the door he backed out and slammed it
LAFB-2230||it was a classic Hustler code impasse
LAFB-2231||the money wasn't the problem I still had about $200 of it
LAFB-2232||had money bendy issue Sammy could have made up the difference
LAFB-2233||if it wasn't in his pocket his woman could quickly have raised
LAFB-2234||West Indian Archie himself for that matter would have loan me $300 if I ever asked him as many thousands of dollars of mine has he gotten 10% of
LAFB-2235||Once In fact when he'd heard I was broke
LAFB-2236||he look me up and handed me some money and grunted stick this in your bucket
LAFB-2237||the issue was the position which his action had put us both into
LAFB-2238||for a hustler in our sidewalk jungle world face and honor were important
LAFB-2239||no Hustler could have it known that he been hiked meaning outsmarted or made a fool of and worse
LAFB-2240||a hustler could never afford to have it demonstrated that he could be bluffed that he could be frightened by a threat that he lacked nerve
LAFB-2241||West Indian Archie knew that some young Hustlers Rose in stature in our world when they somehow Hoodwinked older Hustlers then put it on the wire for everyone to hear
LAFB-2242||he believed I was trying that
LAFB-2243||intern I knew he would be protecting his stature by broadcasting all over the wire his threat to me
LAFB-2244||because of this cold in my time and Harlem I'd personally known a dozen Hustlers who threatened left
LAFB-2245||disgraced once the wire had it any retreat by either of us was Unthinkable the wire would be awaiting the report of The Showdown
LAFB-2246||I'd also known of at least another dozen showdowns and which one took the Dead on Arrival ride to the morgue and the other went to prison for manslaughter or the electric chair for murder
LAFB-2247||Sammy let me hold his 32 my guns were at my
LAFB-2248||I put the 32 in my pocket with my hand on it and walked out
LAFB-2249||I couldn't stay out of sight I had to show up at all of my usual haunts
LAFB-2250||I was glad that Reginald was out of town he might have tried protecting me and I didn't want him shot in the head by West Indian Archie
LAFB-2251||I stood a while on the corner with my mind confused the muddled thinking that's characteristic of the attic
LAFB-2252||was West Indian Archie I began to wonder bluffing a hype on me
LAFB-2253||to make fun of me some old Hustlers did love to Hype younger ones
LAFB-2254||I knew he wouldn't do it as somewhat just to pick up $300
LAFB-2255||but everyone was so slick
LAFB-2256||in this Harlem jungle people would hype their brothers
LAFB-2257||numbers Runners often had hyped addicts who hit hit who were so drug that when challenged they really couldn't be sure if they had played a certain number
LAFB-2258||I began to wonder where the West Indian Archie might not be right had I really got my combination confused
LAFB-2259||I certainly knew the two numbers I played
LAFB-2260||I knew I told him to combinate only one of them
LAFB-2261||had I gotten mixed up about which number have you ever been so sure you did something that you never would have thought of it again unless it was brought up again
LAFB-2262||then you start trying to mentally confirm and you're only about half sure
LAFB-2263||it was just about time for me to go and pick up Jeanne parks to go downtown to see Billy at the Onyx Club
LAFB-2264||so much with swirling in my head I thought about telephoning her and calling it off making some excuse
LAFB-2265||but I knew that running now was the worst thing I could do
LAFB-2266||so I went on and picked up Jean at her place we took a taxi down to 52nd Street
LAFB-2267||Billie Holiday in those big photo blow-ups of her we're under the lights outside
LAFB-2268||inside the tables were jammed against the wall tables about big enough to get two drinks and for elbows on the Onyx was one of those very little places
LAFB-2269||Billie at the microphone had just finished the number when she saw Gina in me
LAFB-2270||her white gown glittered under the spotlight her face had that coppery indian-ish look and her hair was in that trademark ponytail
LAFB-2271||for her next number she did the one she knew who I always liked so
LAFB-2272||you don't know what love is until you face each Dawn with Sleepless eyes until you've lost a love you hate to lose
LAFB-2273||when her set was done Billy came over to our table
LAFB-2274||she and Jean who hadn't seen each other in a long time hugged each other
LAFB-2275||Billy said something wrong with me she knew that I was always high but she knew me well enough to see that something else was wrong and asked in her customary profane language what was the matter with me
LAFB-2276||and in my own file vocabulary those days I pretended to be without a care so she let it drop
LAFB-2277||we had a picture taken by the Club Fort Agra for that night the three of us were sitting close together
LAFB-2278||that was the last time I ever saw a lady day
LAFB-2279||she's dead dope and heartbreak stop that heart as big as a barn and that sound and style that no one's success
LAFB-2280||Lee copies lady de sang with the soul of negroes from the centuries of sorrow and depression
LAFB-2281||what a shame that proud fine black woman never lived where the true greatness of the black race was appreciated
LAFB-2282||in the Onyx Club men's room I sniffed a little packet of cocaine I have gotten from Sammy
LAFB-2283||Jean and I riding back up the Harlem in a cab decided to have another drink
LAFB-2284||she had no idea what was happening when she suggested one of my main Hangouts the bar of the Lamar cherry on the corner of 147th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue
LAFB-2285||I had my gun and the cocaine courage and I said okay
LAFB-2286||and by the time we'd had the drink I was so high that I asked Jean to take a cab on home and she did
LAFB-2287||I never have seen Gene again either like a fool I didn't leave the bar
LAFB-2288||I stayed there sitting like a bigger fool with my back to the door thinking about West Indian Archie
LAFB-2289||since that day I have never set with my back to a door and I never will again
LAFB-2290||but it's a good thing I was then I'm positive if I've seen West Indian Archie come in
LAFB-2291||I'd have shot to kill the next thing I knew West Indian Archie was standing before me cursing me loud is going on me
LAFB-2292||he was really making his public Point floor showing for the people
LAFB-2293||call me found names threatens me every one bartenders and customers sat or stood as though carved drinks in midair
LAFB-2294||the Jukebox in the rear with going I had never seen West Indian Archie high before
LAFB-2295||not a whiskey hi I could tell it was something else
LAFB-2296||I knew the hustlers characteristic of King up on dope to do a job
LAFB-2297||I was thinking I'm going to kill our
LAFB-2298||I'm just going to wait until he turns around to get the drop on him
LAFB-2299||I could feel my own 32 resting against my rib where it was tucked under my belt beneath my coat
LAFB-2300||West Indian Archie seeming to read my mind quit cursing and his words Jarred me
LAFB-2301||you're thinking you're going to kill me first read but I'm going to give you something to think about
LAFB-2302||I am 60 I'm an old man I've been to sing sing my life is over
LAFB-2303||you're a young man killing me you're lost anyway
LAFB-2304||all you can do is go to prison
LAFB-2305||I've since thought that West Indian Archie may have been trying to scare me into running to save both his face and his life
LAFB-2306||it maybe that's why he was high no one knew that I hadn't killed anyone but no one who knew me including my
LAFB-2307||help with doubt that I'd kill I can't guess what might have happened but under the code if West Indian Archie had gone out of the door after having humiliated me as he had
LAFB-2308||I'd have had to follow him out we have shot it out in the street
LAFB-2309||but some friends of what Indian or she moved up alongside him quietly calling his name aren't you aren't you
LAFB-2310||daddy let them put their hands on him and they drew him aside I watch them moving past where I was sitting glaring at me they were working in back for the rear
LAFB-2311||been taking my time I got down off the stool I dropped the bill on the bar for the bartender without looking back I went out
LAFB-2312||I stood outside in full view of the bar with my hand in my pocket for perhaps 5 minutes
LAFB-2313||when West Indian Archie didn't come out I left
LAFB-2314||it must have been five in the morning when downtown I woke up a white actor I knew who lived in the Howard Hotel on 45th Street off 6th Avenue
LAFB-2315||I knew I had to stay high the amount of dope I put into myself within the next several hours sounds inconceivable
LAFB-2316||I got some opium from that fellow I took a cab back up to my apartment and I smoked
LAFB-2317||my gun was ready if I heard a mosquito cough
LAFB-2318||my telephone rang it was the white lesbian who live downtown she wanted me to bring her and her girlfriend $50 worth of reefers
LAFB-2319||I felt it if I had always done it I had to do it now
LAFB-2320||opium had me drowsy I had a bottle of Benzedrine tablets in my bathroom I swallowed some of them to perk up the two drugs working in me had my head going in opposite directions at the same time
