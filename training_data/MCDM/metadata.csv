MCDM-4|And if they're not having fun... Sometimes there's nothing you can do. You have to give yourself permission to say:
MCDM-5|Okay. Maybe it wasn't meant to be. We'll talk more about this in the next video, but I think one of the biggest mistakes people make Is to assume any group of players could all have fun together
MCDM-6|If only you were a good enough DM. If only I had paid more attention to what my players like If only I had more time to prepare the stuff they like
MCDM-7|No. It's actually very hard to grab a random group of musicians and make a band out of them. There are very few bands like Rush, where they all get along for forty years
MCDM-8|Most bands are like The Police, and they hate each other. You get a few good albums out of them and you count yourself lucky that it lasted that long. So when you get your band together for the first time
MCDM-9|Absolutely be critical of your own work as the DM You will spend the rest of your life getting better. Absolutely pay attention to your players and try to learn what they like
MCDM-10|So you can put the content in front of them that engages them. But be open to the possibility that it was not meant to be. And this is not a failing on your part.
MCDM-11|Sometimes, the book you want to write is not the one they want to read. Doesn't mean that it's a bad book or that they're bad readers. Okay, different types of players
MCDM-12|There's the accepted answer and my answer, and my answer is shorter, so we'll start with that. I break everyone down into two categories: Players and audience members. Players engage with the game. They have goals, they want to get stuff done.
MCDM-13|Maybe they want to advance their own agenda, maybe they want to stop the bad guys But they're the ones who think about the game outside the game. These folks make the world go around. I run D&D for them. It doesn't matter if they want to develop their character, get more magic, more levels
MCDM-14|Or join an organization, or stop a bad guy, or build a stronghold These are the folks I run D&D for. Other players are audience members. They are perfectly happy
MCDM-15|And this is an important point, so I'm gonna repeat it for emphasis They are perfectly happy just watching the story unfold and taking their turn in combat and otherwise never engaging with the game. When I was starting out, I thought this was a problem. Why isn't that player engaging? I must be doing something wrong.
MCDM-16|Or, a most treacherous thought: They must be doing something wrong. No. Wrong. Nonsense. If they're having fun, you did your job. You will notice them sit back, watch everything unfold and think:
MCDM-17|This is cool. They'll even say: "This is cool." That means they're having fun. Congratulations. Thomas Aquinas said that when you look at a painting, you don't see the painting, you see a version of it that you built in your head.
MCDM-18|And that version in your head is missing details the artist painted And you may see things they didn't paint, make connections or see context they didn't intend. Aquinas said that the viewers act of creation is just as valid as the one the painter experienced.
MCDM-19|It's not the artist's job to say "No, you got it wrong". The work has to speak for itself. Your audience members are building their own version of your world in their heads. To you, they seem disengaged. They have no motivation, they don't seem to care about your plot or NPCs.
MCDM-20|But they built this amazing version of your world in their heads. Let them do that. Let them appreciate it, it is a perfectly valid thing to do. Maybe they'll eventually engage, but if it happens, it will happen on their terms.
MCDM-21|Do not try to force it. Some players who are audience members in this game become players in another. As long as you got some players and not all audience members,  your game is gonna be fine. Okay, that's my answer. You gaot players and audience members and in the next episode we will talk how to engage your players
MCDM-22|But you should expect some of the folks in your table to be audience members, and if you try to convert them, you'll end up both frustrated and unhappy. If they're having fun, you did good. That's maybe the biggest lesson I've learned over the last thirty years that I've didn't read somewhere
MCDM-23|I had to figure it out for myself, and hopefully, I've just saved you some headaches. Now for the official answer: There's a guy named Robin Laws, smart guy, made his bones in the nineties on games like Over the edge and Feng Shui
MCDM-24|And nowadays makes a great roleplaying game that has very little in common with D&D called GUMSHOE Actually, I think GUMSHOE is the system and there are different games that use it, like The Esoterrorists and Night's Black Agents I'll put the links to those in the Doobli-Doo. If you're keen on RPGs, but aren't interested in fantasy or the tactical elements of D&D, you might really like these games.
MCDM-25|I don't know Robin, but my friend Ken Hite wrote Night's Black Agents. Hi Ken! Robin identified several different types of gamers based on an earlier list by a dude named Glenn Blacow Glenn's list appeared in an article from a magazine called Different Worlds published by Chaosium, that lauched a lot of people's carreers back in the eighties.
MCDM-26|That's your chunck of RPG history for the day. So, in no particular order, Robin Laws's seven types of gamers plus one or two of my own. #1: The Powergamer
MCDM-27|This player basically wants their character to be Thor. Invincible, powerful, badass weapon, fun, for them, is knowing my character is as badass as he can be. And they see your game and the rules as an opportunity to do this.
MCDM-28|They engage with the rules because they see the rules as a problem to solve. I often call these players engineers. They want to learn the system so they can max it out. We used to call these guys Munchkins, from wich this card game gets its name
MCDM-29|But that's pejorative. MinMaxer is still a popular term, less pejorative I've been a MinMaxer in my time It's easy to engage a player like this, just plant some badass item into your world that will make them the best paladin, or monk, or whatever their class is, and let them quest for it. Then, eventually, let them find it. Let them be badass, do not try and teach them a lesson, do not try and smack them down.
MCDM-30|I often, often, see DMs act like a powergamer is somehow challenging them That player doesn't respect my setting, they don't respect my badass NPCs, I'll show them! No, do not do that.
MCDM-31|Your NPCs are not there to kick the ass of the PCs, unless that's a plot point you were aiming for, but that's different We'll talk about that in another episode: Setting up bad guys Power gamers tendo to get frustrated if they don't get the chance to use their cool habilities, so
MCDM-32|Give them a chance to use their cool habilities. Set up difficult scenarios, and when the powergamer wins, they'll feel awesome When I detect that kind of player, I will often give the bad guy just enough hit points to keep them alive, until the powergamer can kill him dramatically with a cool hability #2: The Buttkicker
MCDM-33|Also known as the murderhobo. Often a very social player. Wants to show up, relax with friends and kill stuff. Had a long day and likes pretending to be a badass character who kills stuff
MCDM-34|Gets frustrated when too much time passes without... killing stuff. Killing stuff can also mean: get something done, so these folks sometimes feel satisfied if they solve a problem; complete a quest, But mostly, for these folks, D&D is rolling dice and killing orcs.
MCDM-35|They get bored or frustrated talking to NPCs or dealing with puzzles. They're often not interested in nuances. I had a situation in a game where one player was questioning a hapless captive and another player said "This is boring, I execute the guy."
MCDM-36|Okay, that was a conflict between one player and the buttkicker. The buttkicker got bored listening to the blah-blah and acted. The other player, by the way, stopped playing after that and later told me he didn't realized D&D was a game where one player could ruin another player's fun.
MCDM-37|That was a failing of mine. I should have massaged the situation so that the negotiation wrapped up in a satisfying way So the first player gets what he wants and the buttkicker doesn't get bored.
MCDM-38|I very badly misread that situation. I am mortal. #3: The Tactician Related to the murderhobo and Thor,
MCDM-39|The tactician wants to manage everyone. They don't necessarily want to minmax their character, they want to minmax your adventure. They plan a lot. I love these players. In my games, characters without plans... fail.
MCDM-40|But they tend to want to second guess everyone else's decisions They don't just want their character to do the optimal thing, they want the team to do the optimal thing. They pick up other player's minis and say: "No, you should move over here!"
MCDM-41|They say: "Why don't you use that magic item? It's better than the weapon you're using." Now, the fact that they like doing that doesn't mean that they're good at it. Or that the other players enjoy it.
MCDM-42|Because tacticians gets frustrated when other players don't do what the tactician percieves as the optimal thing, They nag the other players, and hound them. And this is bad. They get upset when another player does something in character, but suboptimal.
MCDM-43|These players need to learn that not everyone wants their advice. I mean, I know a lot of players who also want to do the optimal thing, they just want to learn what that is through trial and error rather than just following someone's orders.
MCDM-44|You may notice these players tend not to care over much about their character's personality or background For the tactician, the key to their fun is the rate of success of their plans. If their plan goes awry, it may not matter if you have a perfectly good explanation.
MCDM-45|They appreciate and prefer a logical world with characters and scenarios that behaves in accordance to their expectations. Tacticians get an idea in their head about what should happen based on your description of the scenario and get frustrated if their plan fails for any reason other than "the dice went against them".
MCDM-46|I've noticed these players tend to be the ones who want to try to trick me. You will experience this. Your players will say: "No, no, no, don't give our plan away" They believe that telling you their plan just gives you more time to find a way to thwart it.
MCDM-47|And, I mean, there are DMs out there who do that I'm not one of them, and probably, neither are you, My job as a DM is not to solve the players problems, it's to solve their solutions. The players come up with crazy solutions to problems and it's up to you to gently remind them of things they've forgotten
MCDM-48|Or details about the scenario they either didn't notice or that they wrongly assumed weren't relevant when you've set it up. Things they can't know? Don't explain. You aren't obligated to make their plan work, you're only obligated to make sure they don't do something dumb just because they forgotten something
MCDM-49|or they've wrongly assumed some detail. I often tell the players: "That's a good idea!" when they tell me their plan, if I think it's a good idea. But then I explain that nothing is certain.
MCDM-50|I will never try and thwart the players just to thwart them, that's insane Though they sometimes perceive it that way because I'm running all the bad guys. I say, and I mean it:
MCDM-51|I'm not trying to kill you, this mind flayer is trying to kill you. It's funny, but it's an important point: My goal is not to kill the PCs, that's ridiculous, is to run the bad guys as realistically as it's reasonable. And the bad guys want to win.
MCDM-52|Anyway, player types. #4: The specialist Some players, if they have a cool character, can have fun just playing their character.
MCDM-53|Nothing else matters, they can have fun in a game they otherwise don't care about because their character is cool. But the specialis only has fun if they play this one character. It's the same character they always play in every game, with the same name, usually.
MCDM-54|I've seen specialists with tunnel vision so bad they want to play their sci-fi anime character in this medieval european game. At first, your reaction is bafflement. "What is going on?", you wonder.
MCDM-55|Then you tease out this is the character this player runs. For these folks, an RPG is an opportunity for them to play this character they always fantasized about being. I sometimesthink the reason they keep doing it, the reason they have this specialty is beacuse no game has really let them do it.
MCDM-56|Of course not. D&D is not designed to let you play a character from Bubblegum Crisis. is that obscure these days? What's popular? One Punch Man, you get it. It's pretty easy to detect these players because of how weird their character is.
MCDM-57|It's the reason I developed my 4d6 in order method, to force players discover their characters rather than bring their baggage to my table. But that's my taste, it's perfectly possible to let their player run their specialty. Be a ninja, or a shapeshifter, or whatever.
MCDM-58|There may not be an class for it, but you can usually take an existing one and bend it a little. You can make Wolverine in D&D with a little creativity. #5: The actor
MCDM-59|Has a highly developed notion of who their character is and loves playing in character. That's the juice for the actor. Often writes an elaborate backstory, though, an elaborate backstory is not a sign of an actor. They usually want to play an flamboyant hero, but not always. Sometimes an actor wants to play the man with no name.
MCDM-60|Like the specialist, this player often gets frustrated when their idea of teir character story is not supported by the rules. They often see the rules as a nuisance, and prefer a session where the dice never came out. The good actor players see the dice as stimuli for improvisation. The troublesome actor players see the dice as the enemy.
MCDM-61|They had a good story in their head and the dice ruined it. For players like this, read their backstory. Use things from it. Give them NPCs to show off to. Pick an element of their backstory and weave it into your game. Give them some opportunities to roleplay that don't rely on the dice.
MCDM-62|Actors care more about "What would my character do" than they do your world or rules. This can sometimes exasperate the other players. "But I'm just playing my character!", they say.
MCDM-63|Don't mistake the actor from the wangrod. I want to use another word there but I'm trying to keep this channel family-friendly. The wangrod uses D&d as an opportunity to be mean. Cruel. And when challenged on this, says: "That's what my character would do!" When the actor says this, they mean it. They though a lot about their character and when challenged on it, it's usually by the tactician
MCDM-64|Who just wants them to do the mechanicaly optimal thing. "But that's not what my character would do" That player I like! We all like players who would rather do the sub-optimal but in-character thing
MCDM-65|Than something drastically out of character just to gain some mechanical benefit. But that's not what happening with the wangrod. The wangrod just wants to inflict pain, sometimes on the other players, and when challenged, they resort to this defense.
MCDM-66|"I'm just doing what my character would do!" They've somehow sussed out that this is an airtight defense. But, of course, it's not. "Well, your character is being a wangrod an is ruining our fun" is the answer.
MCDM-67|Sometimes you have to confront a problem head on. By no means a wangrod is a sadist in real life. This is important. Indulging a fantasy of cruelty is different from the real thing. I think.
MCDM-68|I mean, I'm not a psychologist, I could be wrong. One of the most common complains from new DMs is: "My players won't role-play." But not every player is an actor. Most aren't.
MCDM-69|That's okay. You don't have to talk in character to play D&D and have fun. If someone's not comfortable in getting into character, that's fine, it's not a problem to solve. Give them space, don't put them on the spot and maybe something will come out.
MCDM-70|Some role-playing will happen. If not, that's fine. The funny thing is: I've actually played with real actors and at least in the case of Liam and Matt Mercer and Marisha The only difference between them and other gamers was they narrated their characters successes and failures.
MCDM-71|Took a second to get used to, because tipically, that's my job, but WOW it made my job easier and the game was way more fun for me. I wish everyone would do that. But, for most players, hearing me narrate their success or failure is what makes it real. #6: The storyteller
MCDM-72|Has a lot in common with the actor, but while the actor is primarily focused in role-playing their character, The storyteller wants the most dramatically satisfying outcome possible. The tactician needs to know: "This is what would have happened".
MCDM-73|They don't like detecting the hand of the DM in there adjusting things to stop the PCs from dying Or keep a bad guy alive long enough to do their thing, they need to feel like the outcome of the encounter, For good or ill, is the mos plausible one according to the rules of the game and your own world.
MCDM-74|The storyteller needs to know the dramatticaly appropriate thing happened. This player doesn't mind losing a character as long as their death was dramatically appropriate. The storyteller wants the game to behave like a movie. They're only interested in the rules so far as they support this.
MCDM-75|Storytellers will change their characters personality if it means something dramatically satisfying happens. And here I don't mean drama like interpersonal conflict like teenage drama I mean drama as in narrative: Three acts, antagonist, protagonist, tension, resolution.
MCDM-76|When this player gets an idea on their head of what shoud happen, dramatically, You better make sure it does. At least once in a while. Even if it's not what you have planned.
MCDM-77|You'll detect this when the storyteller does something dramatic, risks their character's life to solve a problem. You thought there was another solution, you don't think the storyteller's solution is any good But... sometimes you got to compromise.
MCDM-78|Let the game play the way the storyteller though it would every once in a while and they'll be happy. #7: The casual gamer I think this is basically the same as the audience member in my example.
MCDM-79|The casual gamer is easy to make happy, they just want to show up, hang out with their friends and watch a cool story unfold. You know how to ruin this player's night?  Put him on the spot. Expect them to talk in character, expect them to negotiate with the NPC
MCDM-80|You'll see them get uncomfortable and they'll often do something out of character just to get out of the situation. As we said before: Don't try and force one type of player into becoming another. Enjoy your audience members. They're enjoying your game.
MCDM-81|I'm gonna add my own humble addition to this list: The mad scientist The mad scientist has a hard time taking all of this seriously. They have fun poking things just to see what happens, they often want to experiment with the world, and often,
MCDM-82|the crazier the result, the better. Mad scientist, you understand: insane. Their characters behave in completely unrealistic ways, but so what? The game is literally not real, so who cares?
MCDM-83|Why are you getting upset? It's just a game. Well, in point of fact, is a game you put a lot of of work into And that's the problem. The mad scientist is, by definition, disruptive.
MCDM-84|They like being disruptive. To them, disrupting the world you built is fun. Because they don't get to do that in the real world. Very young players are often mad scientists. You have kids and you want to run D&D for them, but you don't want to wait until they're fifteen
MCDM-85|So you start when they're nine, and as it turns out, nine year olds don't want to talk to anyone, they want to kill everyone. They want to do, in your game,  all the things they never get to do in real life. For them, that's the fun.
MCDM-86|Now you've detected based on my description that I consider the mad scientist a problem player And I think that for a lot of DMs that's true, but not all DMs think that I've played in games that were explicitly for mad scientist players and it was a lot of fun
MCDM-87|There are whole adventures written for these players, they used to call them Funhouse Dungeons Explicitly crazy. Just surviving is meant to be a reward. I think when we played as teenagers we often just ran around the DMs world doing crazy stuff
MCDM-88|With no regard for logic or reason, and as long as funny or interesting things happened, we were happy. And, often, the DM was having just as much fun as the players. But as we get older, we tend to want more out of the game. If you got a mad scientis player, you may have to take them aside and say:
MCDM-89|Listen , it's fun to screw around with stuff, but this is stuff I put a lot of work into, so it kills me alittle when you screw around with it. No player is one hundred percent any of these archetypes, and a lot of players object to being pigeon-holed As well as they should, but in my experience, these archetypes bear a rough corresponding to reality.
MCDM-90|Finally, my last advice, the best advice I can give you Talk to your players. Talk about what games do they play, about what kinds of books they read or movies they like.
MCDM-91|Tell them what kind of game you run. You'd be surprised with what you might learn. I don't think there's any problem you can't  solve by talking about it. Altough, the solution might be "okay, let's play Talisman"
MCDM-92|let's play someting else where we'll all have fun and I don't have to bust my ass Sometimes it doesn't work out, and that's okay. Not every band is Rush. Allright, those are the different types of players Obviously, these aren't the only types of players
MCDM-93|You can come up with your own list If I had sat down and spent the time I could probably come up with a completely different list It's always dangerous to try to categorize people But I remebmer when I read that list back in the nineties and I found it useful, so hopefully you'll find it useful too.
MCDM-94|I wanna welcome the 1600 subscribers we've gotten in the last five days When we ran the contest last thursday I had 2400 subscribers and as I'm recording this sunday night I have 4000. So we'll well our way to 5000, if you wanna know what I'm talking about, go check out the deck of many things video
MCDM-95|There's a contest inside. Thanks for watching, as always, if you wanna support the channel, you can go by my amazon page I am an independent fantasy author, I write fantasy novels, you might like them.
MCDM-96|Proceeds will go to improving the channel, I would like to get a better camera They would let me record more than ten minutes at a time I would like to get an intro with some animation and music, that would be neat
MCDM-97|I don't think we'll be doing the Engaging your players episode next I'm a little bit burned out talking about different types of players right now Next episode we're going to talk about different types of campaigns
MCDM-98|Specifically: The railroad vs The sandbox And the episode after that, we're gonna talk about critical failure What happens when everything goes wrong This is something I know a lot about, I have critical failures in my campaigns, about once every three years, I think, something goes
MCDM-99|goes catastrophically wrong and I think to myself "I am terrible at this, I am not a good DM" I think watching this show is easy to get an idea of what I like as a Dungeon Master And you create this idealized version of Matt Colville the DM when in reality I'm a mortal like everybody else
MCDM-100|I screw up, I make mistakes, and we're gonna talk about one of these mistakes A big one Not next episode, but the episode after that.
MCDM-101|That's it for this episode. See you next time. Peace. Out!  
MCDM-102|his body is disintegrating he is not of this world and the strain of being here is killing him he is not like us he is
MCDM-103|not one of us he can do amazing things he has one chance to return to his people if he can make it to the
MCDM-104|rendezvous coordinates at the appointed time he will live he will leave us and return to the world he belongs him if he
MCDM-105|fails he dies there are humans who care about him aid him but there are other humans chasing him they want to use him
MCDM-106|or study him he doesn't want to dissect the visitor he just wants to understand and when he does understand he will help
MCDM-107|that's the plot of three different movies each one about a different alien about the humans who help the alien and
MCDM-108|the humans chasing an alien of the three films that follow this plot the pivotal one is John Carpenter's 1984 forgotten
MCDM-109|masterpiece Starman carpenter delivered his first masterpiece two years earlier in 1982 the chilling intensely watchable
MCDM-110|the thing it remains one of my favorite movies the thing opened a few weeks after the first movie to use this plot
MCDM-111|Steven Spielberg's et and et crushed the thing it crushed a lot of movies that summer all of which are more often
MCDM-112|watched and talked about now it crushed Blade Runner filmmakers in the early 80s hoped to use the new explosion in
MCDM-113|science fiction to tell challenging stories but really what everyone wanted was to spend two hours with a cute alien
MCDM-114|the thing was John Carpenter's attempt to make a Howard Hawks movie make a taut masculine action thriller and for my
MCDM-115|money he got as close as you can get without being Howard Hawks people talk about the thing as a masterpiece of
MCDM-116|horror but really I think it's just a brilliant movie forget the genre if the thing had been a hit I think John
MCDM-117|Carpenter would have turned into one of our greatest directors but it wasn't a hit it cost a lot of money and it tanked
MCDM-118|there's a danger when you fail to make enough money for the studio that you'll never get a second chance and Carpenter
MCDM-119|knew it so when he got a second chance he didn't waste it he hit another home run just a show he could do it he said
MCDM-120|oh you want nice aliens fine and delivered Starman a better movie than ET in every way except there's a scene in
MCDM-121|ET where they play Dungeons & Dragons that's cool Carpenter described Starman as his apology to Hollywood for the
MCDM-122|thing I'm sorry I scared the out of you please let me keep making movies alas it
MCDM-123|was too late Starman came in number 30 at the box office that here and carpenter never got a third chance
MCDM-124|to be a major director in Hollywood thanks et et is whether he likes it or not the progenitor of the plotline from
MCDM-125|Jeff Nichols as new film Midnight Special same story the only innovation here is
MCDM-126|making the kid from et the alien but Nicholas didn't want to make et he wanted to make star man he talks about
MCDM-127|it in interviews Nichols said he wanted to make a 1980s John Carpenter movie as though 1980s John Carpenter is a genre
MCDM-128|all its own which maybe it is he said he thought star man was a good place to start he started there but having
MCDM-129|watched midnight special he doesn't seem to have gone anywhere with it star man is in always a more interesting
MCDM-130|rewarding movie Midnight Special raises all the same questions a star man and has just as many answers they're just
MCDM-131|not as interesting in fact they're baffling in their lack of imagination midnight special opens on a black screen
MCDM-132|a radio playing and what we learn is a motel room before we see anything we hear a commercial for a Fort Worth
MCDM-133|Nissan dealership so we know we're in Texas visit WWE em so we know it's the modern day but it doesn't look like the
MCDM-134|modern day everyone in this film the way they dress the cars they drive look like the 1970s just kept going given that
MCDM-135|he's basically remaking a movie set 35 years ago maybe that's nickels his point he likes
MCDM-136|stuff from back then so he made his movie looked like something from back then the film looks great like Starman
MCDM-137|Midnight Special spends all its time on the highways and gas stations and back roads of the American South this is
MCDM-138|Nicholas's territory and he makes it look amazing it's beautiful it's just kind of boring with the possible
MCDM-139|exception of atom drivers character and no one in this movie talks or behaves like a normal person we spend the entire
MCDM-140|movie with a young boy Alton and his parents but no one ever says I love you no one has a nickname for Alton no one
MCDM-141|ever calls him champ or a sport or snicklefritz everyone so in awe of him including his parents who should
MCDM-142|remember a time when their kid was more normal before we could hear and decode encrypted radio broadcasts and other
MCDM-143|languages but they all treat him as though there was never time when he was just their son they act like he was
MCDM-144|always an alien it seems like there was never a point when their lives were normal it would have been nice to see a
MCDM-145|hint of a time before the movie started I love the sentiment his father expresses when Alton says you don't have
MCDM-146|to worry about me Michael Shannon says I'll always worry about you that's the deal he never says he loves his son
MCDM-147|but he says he'll always worry about him I like worrying about you he says baby that's nickels this point love means
MCDM-148|spending your life worrying about someone Michael Shannon is amazing to watch act but apart from the look
MCDM-149|worried and desperate he hasn't given anything else to do every scene he's in it is the same you can mix them up watch
MCDM-150|them in any order still make sense I wanted an ark some humanity something they've got Sam Shepard in this movie
MCDM-151|who was a brilliant actor and writer and we see him for like two minutes and that's it
MCDM-152|crazy to waste him like that Adam drivers amused detached curiosity is fun to watch and gosh I wish we'd gotten
MCDM-153|more that now I think I would have liked the movie more if the whole thing had been from his point of view
MCDM-154|probably the narrative wouldn't sustain that too much of a good thing but unlike everyone else in the movie every time he
MCDM-155|is on screen I was happy and entertained and keen to see what happened next he has more in common with Alton than
MCDM-156|anyone else in the picture he finds everyone even the government he works for amusing and they're clueless
MCDM-157|sincerity and earnestness I was intensely interested in Midnight Special when I first heard about it I haven't
MCDM-158|seen Nichols as other work I didn't really know what to expect but the previews completely hooked me and I've
MCDM-159|spent the last two months spreading the gospel I spent two and a half hours in traffic to see it in LA this weekend I
MCDM-160|wanted to believe but I don't think there was much to believe in Starr man has an arc the title character has an
MCDM-161|arc the woman he kidnaps has an arc Jeff Bridges is playing a complex character with a lot going on into the surface
MCDM-162|Karen Allen is playing a complex character with a lot going on under the surface they are each going through the
MCDM-163|same experience but from opposite directions and that makes it interesting every time Jeff Bridges as alien talks
MCDM-164|does anything we learn something amazing we see something amazing the plot advances his mystery expands and
MCDM-165|tantalizes and moves us it's a remarkably fer tiles to crypt each sequence shows us something new and
MCDM-166|unexpected midnight special is basically the same scene repeated for two hours we never really learned anything about
MCDM-167|Alton he does some amazing stuff often using the same special effects with star man but it doesn't move the plot forward
MCDM-168|or teach us anything about his character when the alien in star man finally meets the government scientist who's been
MCDM-169|curious about him the whole time we get an amazing scene it's sentimental and obvious but sometimes that's what a
MCDM-170|movie demands that same scene in Midnight Special has nothing no information no pathos in star man we
MCDM-171|learn something about the aliens and we learn some about ourselves and midnight special we
MCDM-172|just get a white room and a kid who can do tricks when Alton finally tells us what the
MCDM-173|hell is going on it's baffling I don't mean incomprehensible I mean I was baffled this was their answer I don't
MCDM-174|belong here he says yeah we guessed that but and this is important no explanation is given as to why like he is apparently
MCDM-175|Kirsten Dunst and Michael Shannon's biological kid but he's also an alien from another world what there's a
MCDM-176|profound lack of thought put into the explanation for why everything happens in this movie and I got the sense it was
MCDM-177|meant to be more mystical than science fictional but regardless of whether it's science or fantasy the ending needs to
MCDM-178|pay off the rest of the film star man has a great explanation for everything that's happening everything in star man
MCDM-179|makes a logical sense from the opening premise that mankind has been sending messages to aliens which is true by the
MCDM-180|way we have we really made a spaceship and sent it out of the solar system with a message from Earth on it inviting any
MCDM-181|aliens who find it to come visit us I'm not making that up it's real and everything in star man logically follows
MCDM-182|from it nothing in midnight special makes any sense and when we finally get the closing reveal showing us Alton's
MCDM-183|world it's it's pretty disappointing this is apparently the revelatory religious experience everyone's been
MCDM-184|having when they look in Alton's eyes and the only thing I can conclude is they don't have concept artists in Texas
MCDM-185|or Louisiana like go buy an art book guys go look at a yes album cover from the 1970s Google Sid meat or fangs ooh
MCDM-186|come on I felt the pressure Starman exerted on this film jeff nichols said he wanted to make a movie
MCDM-187|like Star Man but he clearly didn't feel he could just remake that film he didn't feel he could just lift that plot he
MCDM-188|needed to make his own version but his versions explanation for everything is so weak as to completely deflate all
MCDM-189|attention leading up to it when your whole movie is the mystery the mystery needs to be damn good if you've got
MCDM-190|great characters and dialogue and we just love spending time with these people
MCDM-191|then we won't notice much if the destination isn't that interesting but if the journey is flat and monotonous
MCDM-192|you really need a hell of a destination to make it all worthwhile and midnight special acts that star man had great
MCDM-193|characters quotable dialogue great journey great destination Midnight Special doesn't great actors movie looks
MCDM-194|beautiful otherwise there's a scene at the end the last shot in fact I'm not going to spoil it
MCDM-195|that's meant to send us out of the theater wondering leave us with a question but after the events in
MCDM-196|Midnight Special I'm not particularly interested in engaging with that question the movie
MCDM-197|didn't give me any reason to believe there might be an interesting answer there it just made me want to go watch
MCDM-198|star man again maybe et that's why I thought of midnight special let me know what you
MCDM-199|thought if you liked this I'll probably do more reviews in the future movie reviews is something I've been doing
MCDM-200|your semi regularly for the last 20 years on that website and now I've got a camera and I set up here and I thought
MCDM-201|I'd make a video if you liked it I'll make more if you didn't like it I'll probably still make more but I will be
MCDM-202|less excited about it until next time peace out 
MCDM-203|Hi everybody, my name is Matt Colville, and as you can see I am a white, middle-class, middle-aged nerd. And if you guessed, "I bet that guy plays D&D,"  you would be correct. This is my channel and it's about running Dungeons & Dragons.
MCDM-204|Here's the pitch: I want to turn you from someone who wants to play D&D into somebody who wants to run D&D. Being a Dungeon Master is fun! It's creative and it's not that hard. But if you don't know how it's done, it seems intimidating. Maybe you've seen Critical Roll.
MCDM-205|*shouts* Or Acquisitions Incorporated "And a Beholder comes through."
MCDM-206|"What!?" "A real one?" "I've got a way bigger one"
MCDM-207|And thought: 'Wow that seems awesome!' But those guys are amazing I could never do that. Well that's nonsense first of all Matt Mercer and Chris Perkins have been running the game for like a million years.
MCDM-208|Do not compare yourself to them. They are craftsman who have honed their art to a fine edge over literally decades. When you start off, you'll be terrible.
MCDM-209|I realise that's not the most encouraging thing to say but the fact is your players will be new and they won't know you're terrible. That's the secret.
MCDM-210|If you play with your friends and none of you have ever played before they will think you are amazing the way everyone thinks Matt and Chris are amazing. And after a while, you will be a great DM.
MCDM-211|And the thing is, it will be fun the entire time. It'll be fun while you're terrible at it, and it'll be fun while you're great at it. So if you're interested in 'running', I'm here to de-mystify it and show you it's easy and awesome.
MCDM-212|Why would I go through the trouble of making a YouTube series just to teach you how to be a good DM? Because I am a river to my people. "The Turks pay me a golden treasure yet I am poor."
MCDM-213|"Because I am a river to my people!" *people shouting and cheering* 
MCDM-214|You are going to run D&D, tonight, for free, with an adventure that you made. -Well, we made -Ok, I made. The principle is the same. What do you need to get started? You need three things: you need some friends, you need the rules, and you need an adventure.
MCDM-215|Friends: I recommend between 3 and 4, you can run for more, I've run for as many as 9, 10, I think 11 I did once,  it was a nightmare, I do not recommend it. You need the rules: you may be tempted to get the three core rulebooks, the Player's Handbook, the Monster Manual, and the Dungeon Master's Guide, but that's a lot of money to spend for your first time out
MCDM-216|And you'll feel like "I have to read all 3 of these books in order to know  what's going on." That is not true. Wizards of the Coast put the basic rules online for free, the contain everything you need and a simple explanation for how everything works. I put a link to the free rules in the blah-blah down below.
MCDM-217|There's also a link down there to a whole bunch of pre-generated characters, which will make you life a lot easier. They're also official, they're from Wizards of the Coast, you print out a whole bunch of them and you put them in front of your friends and let them pick they characters they want to play. Later on, when your friends are hooked and they love playing, you can let them make their own characters, they'll have a lot of fun doing it.
MCDM-218|But making characters in D&D is- -it's something that's fun to do if you already know how to do it, it is not fun to learn, and it's kind of a pain in the butt. We'll go over how to make characters later on, especially from the DM's point of view in another episode.
MCDM-219|So you need some friends (I said between 3 and 4), you need some rules (you can download those for free online), you're also going to get some pre-generated characters for free (that's also in the blah-blah down there), and you need an adventure. We're going to do that right now.
MCDM-220|Back in the 1970s, when the game first came out, the guys who created the game had their own adventures, but they did not include them in the game, because they thought part of the fun was you making your own, so that's what we're gonna do. You can download lots of adventures for free online, and in fact, there are some great classics you can get at dndclassics.com that're still playable.
MCDM-221|You can go out and get the D&D Starter Set, which I think is twenty or thirty bucks and includes this thing, The Lost Mine of Flapdoodle (Flapdoodle? Phandelver. Whatever.) Not the best name in the world, but this adventure is like fifty pages long, and it would take you about 3, 4, maybe 6 weeks to finish this. I think for your first time, it's best to run something that you can finish in one night and that means 3 or 4 hours of play.
MCDM-222|I think in general, players only get through about 5 encounters in one evening, so our adventure is going to have five encounters. Alright, so, what's an encounter? An encounter is anything  that stops the player's forward progress and challenges them. The classic encounter is: a battle. You open the door, and see 5 goblins, roll initiative.
MCDM-223|That's an encounter. But traps are also an encounter, remember Indiana Jones and the Golden Idol? Or the holy grail?
MCDM-224|- kneal! Those are both traps. Puzzles are encounters. Remember Gandalf at the gates of Moria?
MCDM-225|Frodo: What's the elvish word for "Friend?" Gandalf: Mellon That's a classic puzzle.
MCDM-226|Since the classic encounter is a battle, and you're players are going to be first level, we're going to start with goblins. Goblins are easy to run, and they're pretty flexible, meaning: if your players end up walking through it,  and it's too easy, you can always just throw more goblins in, and adding one or two more goblins to an encounter is not the end of the world.
MCDM-227|So our encounters will be fighting some goblins, fighting some more goblins, fighting the boss of the goblins, there'll be a trap in there, and there'll be a puzzle in there, that's five encounters, that's about one evening's worth of adventure, 3 to 4 hours. Since it's in the name of the game, our adventure is gonna be a dungeon, and therefore, we're gonna need a map  of the dungeon.
MCDM-228|Later on you'll have lots of maps. You'll have maps of the world, you'll have maps of the local area, you'll have maps of the town, you'll have maps of the tavern in the town, But for right now, we just need a map of the dungeon. And the easiest way to draw a map is usually just with a pencil and an eraser (you can tell I'm hardcore because I have this cool art eraser),
MCDM-229|And some graph paper, but since watching me draw something on graph paper is not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, we're going to use a program that is free, you can use online, called Dungeonographer. There is a payed version of Dungeonographer, and I recommend you  get it if you like it, if you find it easy and fun to do.
MCDM-230|There is a link to Dungeonographer down in the blah-blah, so if you want, you can try yourself, you can make your own dungeon. I've also included my Dungeonographer file so you can load it in and you can move things around if you want. Remember, this is your dungeon, customize it, make it yours.
MCDM-231|Woah, transition! Ok, this is Dungeonographer, we're going to create a map of our first adventure, and for our first dungeon we don't necessarily need the sexiest dungeon in the world,
MCDM-232|instead we want to make something that's actually pretty simple and straightforward so it doesn't seem intimidating, and seems like it would be easy to run, I assure you, you and your players will still have fun running it. So, I'm imagining this is a tomb of an order of knights, and that the goblins have broken in and taken it over.
MCDM-233|So we're going to start with an entrance, uh, the entrance to the tomb, we'll put a doorway there in a little while. And, uh, we imagine that there'll be a couple of goblin guards at the top of the entrance, uh, so the players have somebody to interact with, uh, and maybe the players will ambush them. And we'll put some stairs down here, you can tell they're stairs down because the wide lines are at the top and the tiny narrow lines are at the bottom.
MCDM-234|Now we want to put something interesting down here for the players to interact with. So, we drop a trap down there. That's that litte square with a T on it.
MCDM-235|And the idea here is that it's a pressure-plate trap The players have just maybe fought the goblin guards, they're sneaking into the dungeon. and if they're not paying attention, they'll step on the trap and trigger a scythe that comes out of the ceiling.
MCDM-236|A giant blade that will slice them up. Like the trap from the Indiana Jones movie, why not? And now we move on to our next room.
MCDM-237|And here, this is a larger room, this is probably where the goblins are sleeping, or hanging out, or making their goblin nest. And we're going to put in this room kind of the history of the order of knights on the walls.
MCDM-238|There'll be carvings on the walls showing the knights fighting Chaos or Evil. You know, maybe even goblins. And we'll put a little brazier there, a little copper bowl,
MCDM-239|that people in times past have, when they come to the tomb of knights to kind of, like you know, put flowers on their grave, they would make an offering in the copper bowl.
MCDM-240|But this is where the goblins will be hanging out. Now we need a room for our boss monster fight and the players will be encouraged to think that this is the last room of the dungeon.
MCDM-241|The room will be dominated by a giant stone statue of the leader of the order of knights, whose tomb this is. So, the players should be impressed by how awesome this guy was in life. So, we grab a statue icon, that's the little five-pointed star there.
MCDM-242|We'll drop it in and we'll put him on a dais. A little raised off the top of the ground, on a stone platform. And we'll drop the platform in. And now, the way dungeonographer works, I'll have to click on that platform.
MCDM-243|Since I put it in there second it's on top and if I click the "send to back" icon it will cause the, uh, statue icon to pop forward.
MCDM-244|So, we're going to put a bugbear boss in here, leading the goblins, and he'll have a couple of goblin buddies. And there'll be a cool fight in here, and the players may think "That's it!"
MCDM-245|But that's not going to be it, we're going to have something secret in here. Remember we like the idea that there's something hidden.
MCDM-246|And we'll put another room in here where the knights are actually buried. And the players should be wondering, like, "Hey, if this is a tomb, where are the knights' sarcophagi?" Well, there in here.
MCDM-247|And we'll drop, like, a large sarcophagus up at the top for the leader of the order of knights. And then we'll put a few smaller ones in here. So, these are the other knights of the order.
MCDM-248|And because this room is meant to be hidden and something the players have to look for to find, we're going to put a little secret door there, which is the S symbol. And now we've got a pretty cool little dungeon.
MCDM-249|Who are the players going to fight if they come in here? Well, if the start interfering with the tomb, with the sarcophagi,
MCDM-250|uh, some undead guys will pop out. So, it's not going to be just goblins, we'll throw some cool undead in there. So this is our map, and we're gonna export it and we'll
MCDM-251|do a cool little non-repro blue, uh, printout so it looks like the old classic - I happen to like the old, the look of the old classic adventures, and now we'll start labelling our map, we have our entranceway
MCDM-252|which will have our goblin, uh, lookouts, we have our trap, and we'll make it so that that trap, uh, the pressure plate trap is something that if you're light enough, if you're a goblin, for instance, or a halfling,
MCDM-253|you don't trip the trap, and that's how the goblins are able to get in and out, without getting 'scythed' to death.
MCDM-254|And we mark everything else, we mark our ending there, And we start writing our notes directly on the map - why not, I'll often do this in pencil - So we have our goblin lookouts, at the front, we have our pressure
MCDM-255|plate trap, where if you're light enough you don't trigger it, and often, the thief in the party is a halfling, so he may be able to pass and he has no idea there's a trap there.
MCDM-256|We have our offering room, with a brazier, which allows uh, normal people to come and make sacrifices and this will be our goblin bivouac, where the goblins live and sleep and have their collective being, And on the walls, are carvings of the knights fighting, so the players are reminded this is
MCDM-257|a tomb of an order of knights. And we're also going to have, written on the wall opposite the knights, the oath that the knights took in order to become members of their order - that's gonna be important
MCDM-258|later, because we also said we wanted a puzzle in here, and that's going to be part of the fun of room number four, not only is there a goblin boss, with his buddies,
MCDM-259|we have a statue of the leader of the order of knights, and I happen to like the idea that it's an ancient, kind of Roman-esque uh, order, and so his name is Sextus Varnus, and there's uh, a riddle,
MCDM-260|printed, uh, on the daius, that the players can read, and if they're smart, they will figure out the riddle and that will cause the door to open, but a thief can open it, and find the hidden room with the undead in,
MCDM-261|are the undead skeletons? Are they ghouls? You know, maybe that's up to you! And, ultimately, we want some cool treasure that the players find,
MCDM-262|in the sixth room, in the sarcophagus, so they get a cool magic sword. And we want our dungeon to be dynamic, so we create a
MCDM-263|patrol of goblins, that goes all around the mausoleum and out into the forest about every, let's say four hours, and so if the players stay outside, and watch to see what's going on with this mausoleum,
MCDM-264|they'll see the guards outside the front door, but eventually they'll see the goblin patrol, if they're impatient and just go right up to the front door they'll miss the goblin patrol,
MCDM-265|so later, while they're in room three,  fighting the goblins in there, the patrol will find them and come up behind them, and now they're fighting on two fronts.
MCDM-266|and the guys who were in the back of the party who thought they were safe, find themselves in trouble. and that makes it fun, and makes it seem like the goblins are clever and smart, and that's always a good idea.
MCDM-267|And we said we wanted a puzzle, so we'll create a riddle, that'll be inscribed on the pedestal on the statue in room four, this is something I just made up,
MCDM-268|"If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me." And the answer is: your word! If you're going to keep your word to somebody you have to first give them your word.
MCDM-269|"I give you my word." I think an order of knights would really like that. So we're gonna create an oath, that the players, if they speak the oath and give their word to the statue in room four,
MCDM-270|will unlock the secret door. So, what is that oath? We'll create "The Oath of the Delian Order" that's the name of the order of knights,
MCDM-271|And it'll be in room three, on the one wall is the, uh, stone carvings of knights fighting bad guys, and on the other side is the oath.
MCDM-272|"I swear to serve law, battle, chaos, and strive to keep the lore of the Delian Order secret." So the players read this in room three, and wonder what it's about, and if they solve the riddle in room four - even if they don't solve the riddle, they may just speak the oath -
MCDM-273|and the statue will unlock, uh, the secret door, and that's it, they'll get to fight the bad guys, they'll get the magic sword, and that is our first adventure, with a map and everything! Not bad!
MCDM-274|Okay, so we just made our first adventure, except... not really. What we have is a pretty good outline, and a lot of nice detail, we have a map, we have an idea of what's gonna happen in each room,
MCDM-275|But what we're missing for this is the context, we're missing the setup. We wanna know: how did the players find out about this? And why did they go to the tomb in the first place? Also, something else that I realised as I was getting this part of the video ready,
MCDM-276|is that after I'd done everything else, I'd kinda screwed the map up a little bit - I put a trap before the offering room, and the whole idea of the offering room is that this is where people would come, back in the day where the memory of these knight was still recent,
MCDM-277|people would come and make an offering to this order of knights, like, you know, "please bless us and look after us." And it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, to do that, uh, after you get your head cut off by a scythe trap.
MCDM-278|Now, this is entirely typical DM stuff, you'll have an adventure ready, you'll even run and you feel like you understand it, it may be one you created it may be one you downloaded but as you're running it your players start to notice stuff that you hadn't thought of and you're like "oh,
MCDM-279|yeah, that doesn't make any sense, I need to do some fancy footwork here to explain all this." So the next time you run it for the next group of players, you've fixed it, you've tweaked it a little bit, and over time, the adventures that you run - whether they're ones that you've made up yourself or they're ones
MCDM-280|you downloaded or bought, they get better, you get better running them, you make little notes, you remember stuff from last time.
MCDM-281|So what I did was, I just went and rearranged two of the rooms, you can see the map here. and you can see that I just moved the offering room up one square and put
MCDM-282|the trap after. then I rearranged the text so the numbers make sense. And that's exactly the same kind of stuff you're gonna do as a DM.
MCDM-283|So our next episode and the last of this opening series, we're gonna talk about setting up the adventure, explaining it to the players, getting them hooked, giving them a reason to do all this stuff
MCDM-284|and getting into a little bit more detail about how to run it what kind of things are going to happen as you run this adventure? That's it for Episode Two.
MCDM-285|Peace... Out. 
MCDM-286|You've tracked the Goblin raiders to their hideout, a tomb that sits atop a hill. Within lies a host of monsters and the girl they kidnapped to use in their fell ritual. If you hurry, she may still be alive. That is a great way to start your first adventure just pow!
MCDM-287|Drop the players off in front of the dungeon describe the entrance and tell them the stakes goblins and treasure inside just find the girl. Just find the girl. Clear motivation, maybe the simplest most straightforward way to get started certainly the most old-school way to get started
MCDM-288|But is it the best way to get started well? That's up to you, but it's certainly not the only way to get started this episode We're going to talk about maybe the hardest thing to do in dungeons & Dragons and that is
MCDM-289|Getting started going from having everybody sitting at the table And you have an adventure ready to actually playing. That transition is always a huge pain in the butt for me I get nervous I get anxiety
MCDM-290|Once we're playing no problem I can run for hours But getting over that first hump going from just a bunch of people sitting around a table to playing D&D is for me the hardest thing to do.
MCDM-291|Back in the day the DM often began an adventure by dropping the players in front of the dungeon and describing the Entrance that's because a lot of adventures began as modules used at conventions in tournament play That's right competitive D&D which I have done and which is a lot of fun. Also in the 1970s people wanted to play D&D
MCDM-292|Specifically they want to explore the dungeon. They want to kill monsters and get loot and level up They weren't really worried about narrative a question like what's my motivation would have seemed strange to Gary Gygax in 1974. He would have said "To get treasure!"
MCDM-293|That's also a result of the fantasy literature that influenced dungeons & Dragons. Gary Gygax wasn't a huge fan of Lord of the rings He didn't assume that you began the adventure with the talisman that you needed to destroy To save the world because it was the right thing to do
MCDM-294|He assumed you were more like Conan and would happily scale the tower of the elephant because there was treasure inside also because no one Had ever done it before. Nowadays We sort of assume that the players have a clearer motivation for why they're going on an adventure
MCDM-295|Sometimes even a personal stake in what's happening. I say all this to you to give you a historical context a lot of D&D is Tradition passed on from one group of players to the next also
MCDM-296|Because there isn't one right way to do it the way They did it back in 1974 still works And is still a lot of fun is arguably the simplest most straightforward way to start
MCDM-297|But there are other ways to do it. Dusk falls and five travelers come to the Green Dragon Inn for food Warmth and a place to rest Several Villagers are here eating drinking talking about their day. One day is much the same as another in the hamlet of Villane
MCDM-298|But looking at you something tells these villagers today will be different. Start in a tavern, great beginning I often see players online disparaging well every cliche, including that one, but if you're new to this game There are no cliches. Plus
MCDM-299|maybe your players saw the Fellowship of the Ring and remember Aragorn meeting the hobbits at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. That fellow has done nothing but stare at us since we arrived. Excuse me.
MCDM-300|That man in the corner, who is he? His one of them rangers. Dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is I've never heard but round hear he's known as Strider.
MCDM-301|Strider. Great scene. Players, especially new players, enjoy recognizing scenarios from books or comics or movies that they've seen they've seen the movie, but they haven't played it
MCDM-302|This is their opportunity to do the kinds of things they saw in the movies meet the mysterious stranger in the inn Be the mysterious stranger in the inn. Always feel free to rip stuff off This is your campaign put the stuff you like in it
MCDM-303|Starting in a tavern does two useful things one it gives the players the opportunity to roleplay Their characters meeting each other for the first time players like establishing the relationships in the group I'm not gonna lie to you though this can also be awkward uh
MCDM-304|Hello. I mean, my I say, my character sa- Gork, Gork says Hello That's gonna happen. New playersa aren't used to role-playing and haven't used those muscles yet
MCDM-305|So it can be goofy, it can also be frustrating. The mysterious stranger in the corner ignores you Okay, well fine one of the reasons. We do this is because it's fun to do dramatic stuff like that
MCDM-306|But if Gork's player sticks to his guns then he's not going to go on the adventure One of the things I like to do is go around the table and ask each player to describe their character I mean, we maybe already know that you're playing Gork the barbarian
MCDM-307|But what does gork look like? How does he act? How does he seem? If you ask your players, "Okay everybody we're gonna go around the table and everybody introduce your character tell us what you're playing and what your character looks like and how he Behaves." That might be the first time the player has ever really thought about that. Plus
MCDM-308|we always form impressions about people before they even open their mouths just by looking at them. It also acts as a safe halfway point between their character being a bunch of stats on a page and actually role-playing them. So while it can be goofy and awkward starting in a tavern is also fun plus
MCDM-309|It gives the players the opportunity to roleplay their characters and answer the question, "Wait, how do we know each other?" Also number two, they want to know why are we on this adventure? You can just tell them goblins kidnapped a girl and you've tracked them to their hideout. That's fine
MCDM-310|but some players want to experience that they don't just want to be told it, Which do you think would be more fun? In the tavern we have some NPCs to talk to, the innkeep and her husband, their daughter the serving girl, a merchant carter from another
MCDM-311|town. Some may be friendly some may challenge the players but the goal here is to break the ice. Get your players into character by giving them NPCs to talk to and interact with since they may feel awkward talking to each other.
MCDM-312|Classically the easy way to start is to have the serving girl, and it could be a serving boy, we'll talk about stereotypes in another episode yes we will,
MCDM-313|come up and just ask the character what they want to drink, if they're hungry. Depending on what's happened before this may be the first time the player has ever been asked a direct question by another character and they're going to have to come up with an answer.
MCDM-314|Maybe a stupid answer it may be silly it may be dramatic, but in that moment they are role-playing and now you're all playing D&D. But what is there to order? we're in a tavern so we need a menu. Wow! we need people to talk to, and a menu to order from, and all of
MCDM-315|a sudden you're starting to understand why back in the day people said "Screw it, let's just start in front of the tomb." You can make all that stuff up or I can do it for you Which I just did.
MCDM-316|There are tools online for all this stuff including random NPCs, random Taverns, random menus, you are not the first person to need solutions to these problems. People have been doing this for 40 years and they put all their answers up online to save you a lot of work. At some point, after the innkeep has served food and drinks and the players have gotten to know each other and the NPCs,
MCDM-317|something has to happen. A large man wearing a black leather apron over linen shirt and woolen pants bursts in the door He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer "The got Bes,"
MCDM-318|He says, "they got my girl." Goblins have kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter Well now we've got an adventure your players aren't dumb they sat down at the table wanting an adventure And you just put one in front of them if it occurs to them the players may just ask the blacksmith
MCDM-319|What happened give them the opportunity to do that literally ask them okay? What do you do? I think about 50% of the DM's job is just describing what happens and then asking the players of what they do the other 50% is,
MCDM-320|it's complex but there's pizza in there somewhere. Now not all players are motivated by a sense of justice and duty in fact I think you're just starting out most players are motivated by
MCDM-321|Let's call it a enlightened self-interest which is to say greed. In our lives we're expected to do the right thing there are tons of social pressures on us every day. We have show up on time We have to be polite
MCDM-322|We have to be respectful One of the reasons people enjoy playing D&D is it gives them an opportunity to throw all that out and say "Hey? Why should I help that guy? What's in it for me?"
MCDM-323|And there are lots of examples of classic cool characters saying exactly that. "When they come to get me Rick, I hope you'll be more of a help." "I stick my neck out for nobody" "I'm not going anywhere."
MCDM-324|"They're gonna execute her. Look a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured now All you want to do is stay?" "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind." "But they're gonna kill her!" "Better her than me." Look your players aren't dumb
MCDM-325|They know when the blacksmith walked in the door and saying Goblins kidnapped my daughter that that was the adventure showing up, and they might go whoohoo Let's go or they might want a little more motivation, a little bit more convincing.
MCDM-326|Okay so here you go. Yeah! A wanted poster. The Invincible Overlord, really it's the local Baron the Invincible Overlord doesn't care about a bunch of goblins, is trying to clean up the area you can literally print this out and put it in front of your players to read. A prop like this does a great job of motivating the players
MCDM-327|one silver piece per Goblin and giving them some sense of the politics of the wider world who is the Baron who is the Invincible Overlord and making the world Beyond the tavern seem exotic and dangerous
MCDM-328|Ogres, Giants, snake men! If all else fails you can always just have the blacksmith ask the players directly Will you help find my daughter or another trick I've used is to have somebody who is obviously Unqualified like an old man or a young girl volunteer this often helps motivate the players.
MCDM-329|So we met in a tavern, we talked to each other, we talked to the locals, we looked at the wanted poster, and then a Blacksmith's showed up and gave us our motivation. Time to head to the tomb. So where is this place and how do you get there? players like maps. Fact of life, and a lot of DMs like making maps
MCDM-330|it's part of the fun of the game and There are lots of tools for making all sorts of different maps, and we're going to talk about all of them in upcoming episodes but for now
MCDM-331|I'm gonna quote Alfred Korzybski the guy who invented Semantics and say "The map is not the territory." I use maps all the time, but not only do you not need a map I'm gonna argue that there are good reasons not to use a map
MCDM-332|We live in a time where it's trivially easy for people to whip their phone out and get directions from anywhere to anywhere You have a basic understanding of the shape of the earth and the country that you live in and the local area But that was not true for most of human history if you were a medieval peasant it was very easy to live your entire life
MCDM-333|Without ever going more than a few miles outside of town. Maybe you'd visited one or two towns nearby, maybe you'd seen a map of the world in church, or in one of the few books you had ever seen, but that was unusual. It can therefore be more immersive for you to say 2 miles to the North lies the
MCDM-334|Boar forest and beyond that the tomb on the hill. That is how people thought in the middle ages and not only does it save you work It makes the world feel more dangerous and more mysterious. Show the players a map and they feel like they understand something. Describe it using language and landmarks, and it feels like the world is a large mysterious place
MCDM-335|which it should. So without a map showing us how to get there, How do we find the tomb? Easy the goblins left tracks. It may occur to the players to go to the Smith's house and look for tracks if they do that they get to feel like detectives
MCDM-336|and that's part of the fun. If they never think of that have an NPC suggest it. That's what NPCs are for. The goblins left tracks that are easy to follow they go north to the boar wood. It may occur to the players to ask the
MCDM-337|locals, "Hey, what's in the forest?" The locals will say "Nothing, boars. It's in the name of the forest we hunt there all the time There's no goblins."
MCDM-338|So the goblins must be somewhere beyond the forest however big the forest is it's not something the players can get through in one day They're gonna have to spend the night there we put the forest between the tomb and the tavern because we want the players to have To spend the night we want the players to have to take watch in the middle of the forest and be wary
MCDM-339|Wondering if something's going to attack them in the middle of the night why because it makes the world feel more mysterious And it makes the players feel like they're on an adventure like anything might happen any Time the players stop and rest outside of town. I have them roll for a random encounter. We'll do a whole episode later
MCDM-340|maybe more than one on random encounters, but the goal here is to make the world feel dangerous. If the players feel like they can stop and rest any time they're wounded or low on spells
MCDM-341|then they will do so and that will grind everything to a halt. Players naturally want to avoid risk your job is to make everything outside of town seem Risky the world is a dangerous place But for this episode. I'm gonna roll some dice behind the screen and tell the players the evening passes uneventful.
MCDM-342|I mean you can do what you want. You can throw an ogre at them or maybe a pack of dire boars It is after all in the name of the forest but our goal here is for the players to finish something tonight. And that means we want to get him to the tomb as quickly as possible.
MCDM-343|Once outside the forest after an hour two of travel the players will see the tomb on top of a hill I like to use old roman ruins for things like this because it communicates to the players this belongs to an ancient civilization. At this point the players may want to hang back and watch the tomb for a while,
MCDM-344|See if there's any Goblin activity, that's a good idea let them do that. Remember we put a goblin patrol around the tomb on purpose in case they did that so the players started in a tavern, they met each other, they met the local NPCs, they met the Blacksmith,
MCDM-345|they found out his daughter had been kidnapped by Goblins, they followed the Goblin tracks through the forest, they spent the night and the next morning they showed up at the tomb. Now they're sitting and watching waiting to see what happens.
MCDM-346|We'll talk about running the tomb about how many goblins to use and about what kinds of things are going to happen inside the dungeon Next week. Peace out. 
MCDM-347|okay let's talk about NPCs everybody matt covert here i set up an idea in former page which there's a link to in
MCDM-348|the doobly-doo so that folks who wanted to could let me know what kinds of videos they want to see and you get to
MCDM-349|vote on different people's ideas and the ones with the most votes rise to the top and the number one video people wanted
MCDM-350|to see was on NPCs but I'm not I'm not 100% sure how to boil down everything I know about how to run NPCs into one
MCDM-351|video so this may be the kind of thing where there's a whole bunch of questions in the comments and there'll be another
MCDM-352|video maybe this isn't the NPC video maybe this is just a and peasy video and there'll be another one later where I
MCDM-353|answer people's questions I started by going on a twitch and saying alright folks what is there about running an NPC
MCDM-354|that you feel like you need help with I got a lot of answers but by far the number one answer the most common answer
MCDM-355|was people who were looking for advice on how to make their NPCs memorable and I was like okay memorable now I was
MCDM-356|somewhat suspicious of that and you'll see why so I think the next day I said name a memorable NPC again I got a lot
MCDM-357|of answers but probably around 80 to 90 percent of them were examples from critical role specifically two
MCDM-358|characters on a whole bunch of people named two specific characters from critical role so if you're not familiar
MCDM-359|with Matt Mercer's D&D game that is on twitch every Thursday night I'll put a link in the doobly-doo
MCDM-360|I sort of presume everyone who watches this is but I am occasionally reminded that there are some few people out there
MCDM-361|who got to this channel via other means one of the two NPCs that was brought up often was Gilmour and I thought okay I
MCDM-362|think I understand I know who Gilmour is I think I understand what makes that character memorable we'll talk about
MCDM-363|that in a second but the next character that people referenced the next NPC people talked about as being memorable
MCDM-364|was a character I had not heard of before because I don't watch every episode of critical role it's like four
MCDM-365|hours a week holy crap and that was Victor the black-powder merchant I didn't watch the episodes he was in or I
MCDM-366|didn't watch that part I watched about 45 minutes to an hour and a half of most episodes of critical role and it's
MCDM-367|astonishing how much time I spend in my week watching that show but how little of that show I have seen I felt like I
MCDM-368|understood what made Gilmore a memorable NPC but I didn't know who Victor was so I went and looked him up I thought who
MCDM-369|is this Victor guy and what makes them memorable yes oh you mean back powers coming coming he runs back into the hub
MCDM-370|okay yeah I get it obviously it's clear what makes that NPC memorable in both instances Gilmore and Victor the black
MCDM-371|powder merchant Matt made these NPCs memorable I giving them crazy voices or making
MCDM-372|them really overtly flamboyant characters I mean Gilmore is a very flamboyant character he's described in
MCDM-373|the critical role wiki as having a broadway personality which is a euphemism I had not encountered before
MCDM-374|but it worked I mean I knew what they meant as soon as I said it Gilmore speaks flamboyantly he dresses
MCDM-375|flamboyantly he comes on two backs I think people when they see folks like the players and Matt I'm critical role
MCDM-376|they think that there must be some trick there must be some way something like a checkbox they could check off and if
MCDM-377|they do this if they follow these instructions then they will have a memorable character or memorable NPC but
MCDM-378|really I think the trick for doing outrageous personalities which is what makes Gilmore and Viktor the
MCDM-379|black-powder merchant memorable or doing great accents is just being there's no trick to it you just have to be willing
MCDM-380|to look like an idiot not only do you have to be willing to look like an idiot you have to be willing to look like an
MCDM-381|idiot a lot because eventually you won't look like like those guys the folks on critical role do not look like idiots
MCDM-382|they look like pros they literally are pros they were not born that way they had to work at that you know often for
MCDM-383|years and in fact I think most of them would say they're always working at it it's not it's never a solved problem I
MCDM-384|saw a video of someone this was incredibly flattering and also just really inspiring for me as a YouTube
MCDM-385|creator someone online who was doing my Dragonborn accent whenever I play a Dragonborn either as a player or in my
MCDM-386|campaign as a DM I look at those guys as skull and the shape of the heads and I'm like there is no way these folks would
MCDM-387|talk like normal people they would have trouble forming words right they don't really have lips they have like forked
MCDM-388|tongues and stuff so I always play them with these crazy accents and whether or not my players like it it is memorable
MCDM-389|one somebody said it sounded like Bill Nye he's character Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean that's fine
MCDM-390|that works for me you notice that wasn't really an accent that was more of a mannerism I just did this crazy thing
MCDM-391|with my voice and called it good and I think it was flamboyant enough that it made it somewhat easy to copy so if
MCDM-392|you're looking for a trick as to how to make an npc memorable unfortunately there really isn't one other than just
MCDM-393|going for it you just have to go for it some of your friends are going to laugh some of them are going to think that
MCDM-394|it's ridiculous it might turn some of them off but that's because you're completely new at this years from now
MCDM-395|after you've been doing this for a while you'll be super confident and your friends will be really impressed if you
MCDM-396|want to make an outrageous character if you want to make it in peace either your players are going to remember and you
MCDM-397|want to go for an accent or something like that look I'm not a dialogue coach but I can tell you a couple of tricks
MCDM-398|that I've learned over the years first of all performing an npc in a memorable way does not rely on an accent you heard
MCDM-399|my Dragonborn voice is that an accent I don't think so I think it's just a crazy way of talking maybe what's the
MCDM-400|difference we're not an accent I don't know but I often give NPCs tics or ways of speaking of phrases they deploy or
MCDM-401|I'll change my voice up I'll go into a higher or a lower register or there'll be some words I avoid using you know
MCDM-402|like data doesn't use contractions for instance and I think there he screwed that up a couple times but that you get
MCDM-403|the point you know I'm the lead rider at Turtle Rock Studios I wrote 98% of the dialogue for evolve and when I'm writing
MCDM-404|a character like Abe who Matt mercer played when I'm writing a character like Abe or Hyde these are characters that
MCDM-405|deploy a lot of profanity that's just their natural language but when I write a character like Cabot that dude never
MCDM-406|swears Cabot doesn't swear for the same reasons that Abe and Hyde do it's how he was raised but it also says a lot about
MCDM-407|him as a person as leader so the choices you make in the words you deploy whether or not you swear has a huge impact on
MCDM-408|how your player is going to perceive the character so it's not all about accents and funny voices I really want to break
MCDM-409|the back of that idea because again if you watch a critical role you're gonna think oh playing D&D means doing accents
MCDM-410|it means getting into character now that's one way to do it and it's a lot of fun I am typically the most
MCDM-411|actively the most theatrical character at any given table I'm at so obviously I like doing that stuff but the people I
MCDM-412|like playing with the most the best DMS I've ever played with my one of my favorite all-time favorite DMS never did
MCDM-413|any voices he never role played in character he would always describe what the PC NPCs were doing in third-person
MCDM-414|that is perfectly legitimate I am giving you permission to be you can be a perfectly good DM and your players will
MCDM-415|love playing with you and you never speak in character once you just describe what the NPCs are doing or what
MCDM-416|they're saying in an otherwise neutral way you can say the NPC gets angry but that doesn't mean you have to shout so
MCDM-417|consider if you're going to role play the character if you're going to try and get in character it doesn't have to be
MCDM-418|about accents we'll talk about accents in a second but I don't want that to be the overwhelming like you know Gilmour
MCDM-419|doesn't really have an accent he has a flamboyant Broadway personality but is that an accent right I'd still love
MCDM-420|broadway personality as aces one of the things i do as a writer I also do this as a DM but I learned
MCDM-421|this stuff as a I cut my teeth on this as a writer and I did in texts for years and eventually I was able to do it in my
MCDM-422|normal speech is I deploy Latin or anglo-saxon Old English Old English words or Latin words depending on
MCDM-423|whether or not this is an intelligent well-read character or not intelligent well-read characters often use in the
MCDM-424|real world often use Latin eight world they'll say planet where as somebody who's a you know a down-to-earth
MCDM-425|salt-of-the-earth uneducated person would say world that has a big impact on how my NPCs are perceived the players
MCDM-426|can tell this guy's smart based on not what he says but how he says it when they need a farmer when they need a
MCDM-427|peasant that peasant might say the same things that an educated the wizard from the tower might say but he'll say in a
MCDM-428|completely different way he'll choose different words to use now that is advice I don't know if it's a good
MCDM-429|advice because it's super esoteric it's the kind of thing you really have to work at for years but the good thing
MCDM-430|about running Dungeons and Dragons and basically having D&D as a hobby is that the stuff that you start trying now is
MCDM-431|gonna pay off for years you know I have no problem I was talking to my friends at work I bought a brand new a big huge
MCDM-432|tool chest to store all my stuff in and more than one person commented on how expensive this thing was and I was like
MCDM-433|look this thing I'm gonna be using this in in many cases every week for the rest of my life so don't be afraid to try
MCDM-434|accents also let's talk about accents don't be afraid to try accents don't be afraid to try stuff like choosing
MCDM-435|different words in your speech because even though you're gonna suck at it now eventually you will be pretty good at it
MCDM-436|all right so accents look the best way I think to learn accents is to have a really long drive so if you don't if you
MCDM-437|live close to work or school move because if you've got about a half an hour long drive I think more than that
MCDM-438|will be taxing on the head meats if you got that half an hour long drive you can listen to audiobooks and you can listen
MCDM-439|to NPR NPR is a great source I mean I listen to NPR because I'd like to know what's going on but I listen to NPR
MCDM-440|often they are interviewing people from other countries and you get or other parts of America and you get to hear all
MCDM-441|these great accents and I'm alone in the car driving along and I will parrot the accent back and not only the tone of
MCDM-442|their voice and where they put the accents and stuff like that but also stuff like word shorts again word choice
MCDM-443|is huge so have a half-hour long drive listen to NPR practice the accents and not don't just listen and don't just
MCDM-444|pare it back the inflections in their voice but also notice the words they shoes I'm actually
MCDM-445|kind of opposed I mean I in as far as this is a philosophical issue but I'm kind of I always find it weird when
MCDM-446|people are playing Dungeons & Dragons and they start putting on English accents unless your game unless you're
MCDM-447|playing a Robin Hood game or King Arthur game or my friend Jim's game which was set in Albion which was fantastic unless
MCDM-448|you're playing a game set in England why does your character have an English accent you know one of the brilliant
MCDM-449|casting choices of all time I think in my personal opinion is casting Richard Boone as Smaug but there's a lot of
MCDM-450|crazy accents in the rankin/bass Hobbit and you know it's funny looking back I remember thinking that Hobbit movie the
MCDM-451|animated Hobbit was kind of cheesy but compared to the train wreck that was Peter Jackson's version Wow
MCDM-452|the animated Hobbit is now is grown in my estimation but Richard Boone's Smaug is amazing listen to the way this dude
MCDM-453|talks well see I smell you feel your air and I hear your breath come along help yourself
MCDM-454|there's plenty and spare right that is not that dude is not that's the way that guy talks he's not putting on an accent
MCDM-455|he's just Richard Boone he's a great huge fact he was famous before maybe he's not famous for being Smaug but he
MCDM-456|was famous or well-known for often being the heavy the bad guy in westerns he's just doing his normal voice that's just
MCDM-457|how he talks but it's super memorable so I'm a huge critic of that fake British accent that's why a lot of characters of
MCDM-458|my novels speak like modern humans because that's how it would have felt if you were in a medieval era you would if
MCDM-459|you were born and raised in the eleven 30s the people around you spoke from your point of view contemporary English
MCDM-460|and we speak contemporary English so so don't feel pressure to do a British accent it's kind of ridiculous feel free
MCDM-461|to speak in your normal voice feel free to affect other American accents here's one secret uh when you first do
MCDM-462|something crazy when you first do a flamboyant character at first your players first impression is going to be
MCDM-463|that's crazy what is our DM doing but only after 30 seconds 45 seconds a minute it will stop
MCDM-464|being this crazy thing you're doing and it will just become who this character is you just got to stick to your guns
MCDM-465|another thing that's great about having a half-hour long drive is listening to audiobooks I listen to a lot of the
MCDM-466|Terry Pratchett books read by Stephen Briggs if you can find those I strongly recommend reading them
MCDM-467|a because terry pratchet is a genius and B because Stephen Briggs I mean there are so many characters in Terry
MCDM-468|Pratchett novels I really do not envy the narrator of them because he's got to find a way to make all of these
MCDM-469|characters this huge cast all sound distinct so he gives all these different characters different accents in order to
MCDM-470|differentiate them and I'll be driving along in my car and I'll just be parroting back Stephen Briggs his
MCDM-471|versions of these accents one of the things I love about Stephen Briggs his choices as a narrator is it he makes all
MCDM-472|the doors well at least I think it's a Welsh accent what do I know so that's the first I always try to make sure that
MCDM-473|the first and best advice is upfront I think people when they watch critical role they are inspired by the NPC's Matt
MCDM-474|creates and they want to know how does he do it and the most memorable characters he has created are not
MCDM-475|Gilmore is a pretty sophisticated dude but there is a the first impression he gives is very strong and that's because
MCDM-476|matt has made these characters deliberately outrageous flamboyant characters and there's no trick to that
MCDM-477|you just have to be willing to look like a jackass for a little while Matt does not look like a jackass when he does it
MCDM-478|because he's been doing this for decades well not decades I don't know a long time you get the point but this is now I
MCDM-479|think where we get to the meat of this video and that is I I question the desire to make memorable NPCs I question
MCDM-480|it I'm not saying it's a bad idea I'm just saying think about what you're asking why should n P C's be memorable
MCDM-481|what is the purpose of NPCs I as a DM I do not sit around thinking how am I going to make this NPC memorable that is
MCDM-482|honestly something I have really never worried about I worry about how to make bad guys memorable we did a whole video
MCDM-483|on that but when I'm making NPCs for the characters to meet really my goal is to make them plausible it's to give the
MCDM-484|players opportunities to see how they are perceived by the world around them and give them characters to react to and
MCDM-485|interact with it's that moment where other characters treat the players like a hero that makes them feel heroic so my
MCDM-486|NPCs are typically there to either show the players how they are perceived in a positive or negative light when my
MCDM-487|players start off at first level the people that they meet are often suspicious of them because they are
MCDM-488|itinerant adventurers and trouble follows them the town's folk are typically happy being town's folk and
MCDM-489|it's only once these adventures show up that all of a sudden their problems with goblins and stuff like that later on
MCDM-490|once they've saved the town the people are grateful to them and seeing that both instances the goal of the NPC is to
MCDM-491|show the players how they are perceived first with suspicion but then later with gratitude and that transition from
MCDM-492|suspicion to gratitude is really rewarding I've seen it pay off with dozens of players they love that feeling
MCDM-493|of having once been treated badly by these NPCs or at least with suspicion sometimes with open contempt because of
MCDM-494|the reputation that adventurers have they love that feeling of having saved the blacksmith daughter and coming back
MCDM-495|and now these people are super grateful to them that is a very rewarding experience is it memorable does it make
MCDM-496|the NPC's memorable I don't think so they remember that experience though they remember that feeling and it makes
MCDM-497|them feel like heroes so my goal with NPCs is to kind of show the players either how they are perceived or how
MCDM-498|different elements of the world are perceived often my players will read something I've written in some
MCDM-499|background for my campaign and they don't know exactly how it works they can't imagine it but once they meet the
MCDM-500|NPC's then they start understanding how this stuff works like for instance they read the one sheet I hand out and they
MCDM-501|think the invincible overlord must be some tyrannical evil entity that everyone's terrified of but then once
MCDM-502|they start playing they realize oh no they meet people and the people are like well be invincible overlord is not we've
MCDM-503|never seen him we don't know anything about him they have local problems each NPC they meet is an opportunity for me
MCDM-504|to kind of convey a point of view what do people think of the Baron what do people think of the invincible overlord
MCDM-505|what do people think of the Dragon Knights I do not worry about backgrounds in fact I am strongly opposed to them on
MCDM-506|more than one video game project I've worked on artists people have come to me and asked me for long extensive
MCDM-507|backgrounds I don't know why they literally asked for stuff like what is this character's blood type but for
MCDM-508|whatever reason people want extensive backstories and I find that to be a huge red herring you know there's a great Q&A
MCDM-509|with Aaron Sorkin on reddit Aaron Sorkin I think one of the great writers over the last 25 years and he said he
MCDM-510|explained he's like look a character is born when they walk on stage and they die once they walk off stage they have
MCDM-511|no background before that they have no existence after that now that is an extreme viewpoint but this is very
MCDM-512|useful when running I think a lot of people feel this pressure as DMS that they need to know the history of these
MCDM-513|characters no that's not true what they do need to know what is useful is what is this character's motivation and what
MCDM-514|is their personality now both of these things can be informed by their backstory but in my experience that just
MCDM-515|comes out actually as you play them it's not something you have to have worked out
MCDM-516|ahead of time so do not feel like you have to sit down with every NPC and ride out this long backstory that's
MCDM-517|ridiculous motivation and personality what does this character want and then how do they
MCDM-518|express themselves you know when they meet a guard what is a guard want a guard wants to make it home that day
MCDM-519|alive and meet his family he doesn't have to arrest anyway he doesn't have to get in a fight this one
MCDM-520|have to use his weapon and that makes him suspicious when the adventurers show up he's like oh Christ not these guys
MCDM-521|because adventurers are often bristling with weapons and they are they look different than normal people and so
MCDM-522|they're there to make the guards life difficult a town guard is going to often be suspicious of adventures and consider
MCDM-523|them this incredible annoyance you know what is the innkeep want the innkeep wants to provide first family the
MCDM-524|innkeep wants to serve food the innkeep wants to make some money it doesn't take a lot of work or even really a lot of
MCDM-525|thought to figure out what does this NPC want then the only question is what is their personality you know what they
MCDM-526|want now how do they express themselves you know peasants tend to express themselves simply and directly bards
MCDM-527|tend to be flamboyant noblemen tend to use a lot of flowery language they've been educated there are a million
MCDM-528|different kinds of mannerisms for you to choose from and I think less is more pull it back you don't have to be
MCDM-529|flamboyant you don't need to be memorable you're just trying to sell the idea that this is a real person and the
MCDM-530|real people you and I both know are typically not incredible flamboyant personalities I mean I think I have a
MCDM-531|reputation for being a really high energy this is this is the me for the video the me in real life is not like
MCDM-532|this this is my YouTube personality a mannerism can be something simple like he picks his teeth while he talks a
MCDM-533|mannerism can be something simple like he doesn't look you in the eye why doesn't this character look you in the
MCDM-534|eye is it because they are suspicious is because they're afraid of you maybe it's just because that's how they are so
MCDM-535|motivation personality what does this NPC want how do they express themselves I think the number one question I ask
MCDM-536|myself when I'm running a NPC is how does this NPC perceive the heroes if heroes occupy this weird class where
MCDM-537|they're not exactly noblemen but they're also better than peasants how where does this NPC
MCDM-538|fit in this is this NPC a peasant is the normal town's person and do they look up to the heroes and looking up to them
MCDM-539|does that mean that they're afraid of them that they admire them or do they consider the heroes unequal are they
MCDM-540|another adventurer or maybe a member of the Thieves Guild or are they a nobleman looking down on the heroes that is a lot
MCDM-541|to do with how I run an NPC I think about how do they perceive the heroes because I think I think that's the most
MCDM-542|important thing is showing the players themselves and then they worry about stuff like what is this character no
MCDM-543|obviously I know everything there is to know about this campaign setting but the NPC
MCDM-544|doesn't so I often have we talked about this in the information video I often make sure there was a very poor
MCDM-545|signal-to-noise ratio the NPC might have a lot to say but does that mean that they're right does that mean they can be
MCDM-546|trusted a farmer knows a lot about farming and he knows a lot about the local town but he does know a lot about
MCDM-547|much else if you're talking about farmers or peasants or local townspeople it's reasonable to assume that they
MCDM-548|might be really superstitious and they believe that the local force is haunted does that mean it is haunted well that's
MCDM-549|up to you but maybe not because the DM knows everything because the DM is the ultimate authority of the table there's
MCDM-550|an overwhelming tendency for the players to just accept everything your NPC's say as the gospel because it's coming from
MCDM-551|the DM so I often make sure my NPCs say things that the players immediately go oh wait a minute of course this guy
MCDM-552|thinks this because of course he thinks the force is haunted he's a peasant of course he thinks that demons abducted
MCDM-553|the blacksmith's daughter because he's never seen a goblin before if they need it dwarf NPC the dwarf advises violence
MCDM-554|because dwarves in my setting are like short Klingons their honor obsessed they love alcohol and they love
MCDM-555|fighting I've had many instances where dwarf NPC advised just a frontal assault on whatever the problem was and the
MCDM-556|players go whoa is that possible are we gonna win and the dwarf like win who cares if we win at which point the
MCDM-557|players are like okay we we can't listen to this guy I know we've talked about this before so that's how I view NPC
MCDM-558|creation I don't worry about backstory I don't worry really about accents or voices I do concentrate a little bit on
MCDM-559|mannerisms I worry about their motivation what is this NPC what did I worry about their personality how do
MCDM-560|they express themselves and then I think about what is their station what place does this NPC occupy in the world are
MCDM-561|they a peasant are they a nobleman then I think about how does this NPC view the heroes because that's I think the best
MCDM-562|thing an NPC can do is show the players themselves show them a point of view each NPCs can have a different point of
MCDM-563|view toward the characters I'll give you some examples we're gonna talk about three different NPCs that I've used
MCDM-564|recently the first is Lord Edmund betta gar Lord Edmund betta gar is a 13 year old
MCDM-565|nobleman the players thought the family betta gar had been dead murdered by orcs but the orcs kept one of the family
MCDM-566|alive in case they needed to use him for bargaining purposes so when I created Lord Edmund I thought about two things I
MCDM-567|thought about what is his motivation what is his personality one his motivation is to do his duty he's a
MCDM-568|nobleman he's going to find out when he talks to the heroes that his entire family is dead that he is the last
MCDM-569|member of the family betta gar and also that he is the baron a minute ago he was a 13 year old kid how
MCDM-570|captive by the orcs but now not only is he free he realizes I'm the baron so that's his motivations motivation is
MCDM-571|to do his duty was his personality well he's a nobleman so he's gonna be very haughty imperious not because he's
MCDM-572|trying to be off-putting because that's how he was raised I think he was the first legitimate nobleman my players had
MCDM-573|met and so it was important to me to make sure that they understood that this is a feudal society and there is a
MCDM-574|proper way to treat noblemen here everything else about Lord Edmund fell out of those two things one his
MCDM-575|motivation do my duty to his personality very haughty and noble maybe the most important element of his personality
MCDM-576|came out during playes not something I had written down or anything it was the fact that I realized as I was playing
MCDM-577|him that he's a 13 year old kid but at the same time he's the baron and he is aware of that making your NPCs
MCDM-578|self-aware aware of how they are perceived as a big deal he knows I'm just a kid but he also knows I am the
MCDM-579|Baron so it was important to Lord Edmund that other people treat him like the baron that was a problem he needed to
MCDM-580|solve immediately if they just treated him like a 13 year old kid then they wouldn't give him the respect that he
MCDM-581|needed as a nobleman and the existence of nobleman is largely just a shared illusion there's no physical quality
MCDM-582|that makes a nobleman different than a peasant so when he dealt with the PCs he demanded they treat him like a nobleman
MCDM-583|and they didn't like that by the way they very quickly got sick of this kin he confronted them several times he made
MCDM-584|it an issue and in each case they backed off when he said you will address me as my Lord or sire graves played by my
MCDM-585|friend Phil was like all right Phil said several times I'm really starting to hate this kid but he did it this created
MCDM-586|a lot of interesting tension it was the first opportunity for the players to decide where do we stand on the whole
MCDM-587|feudalism thing whose side are we on when Lord Edmond said you will refer to me as sire or my lord he didn't do it in
MCDM-588|an accent he didn't do with any kind of crazy mannerism he just acted like a nobleman and it put a crisis in front of
MCDM-589|the players would they do that it forced them to think about how do we feel about this how do we feel not just about this
MCDM-590|kid but the idea of there being a bear and a better guard do we care who's in charge well it turned out they did
MCDM-591|because their enemy was Lord Saxton the usurper so even though they didn't like this kid he was the legitimate heir it
MCDM-592|was useful for them to keep him alive that moment where Edmond said you will refer to me as sire or my Lord became a
MCDM-593|kind of microcosm for the entire idea of feudalism the idea of chaos versus law where are the players going to fall on
MCDM-594|that spectrum and the fact that Lord Edmonds attitude was kind of annoying this imperious thirteen-year-old kid got
MCDM-595|their nerves because of the way he insisted they treat him it made it so that it was a real test it would have
MCDM-596|been easy for them to just lock him back up again they talked about that that's one of the things I enjoy doing with
MCDM-597|NPCs is testing the players beliefs sure the Paladin wants to do the right thing but it's kind of hard to do the right
MCDM-598|thing when the NPC who needs help is being a huge helping somebody who is sympathetic is easy helping
MCDM-599|somebody who is not sympathetic is a little bit more difficult and that's dramatic having conceded to Lord Edmonds
MCDM-600|request and treated him like a nobleman which he had insisted on them doing later on he returned the favor and made
MCDM-601|Nicodemus The Count of Rennes that's the reason Nicodemus is the count of Rennes if you missed that episode and at that
MCDM-602|moment I mean nothing about Lord Edmond had changed he was still the imperious haughty thirteen-year-old kid but at
MCDM-603|that moment they really liked this character because everything he had done had been consistent making Nicodemus the
MCDM-604|count of Rennes had been a noble activity just as insisting on being called sire or my lord was another NPC I
MCDM-605|enjoyed running was edrick I think you got to see me run edrick in the stream with girls playing variks now ed ryx job
MCDM-606|was to support Vargas he was an npc in for kisses party edrick was a cleric I created him because Gertz was playing by
MCDM-607|himself and in case he got in over his head I want to make sure that he had some help so of course the best support
MCDM-608|character is a cleric but I never wanted Adric to feel like an equal edrick was always someone who looked up to vork
MCDM-609|asst edrick was a peasant edrick was a cleric but he was just one of the guys at the church that you know lit candles
MCDM-610|and stuff like that he was never a hero he was never an adventurer he's very pious he knows some things he knows a
MCDM-611|lot about the church but doesn't know anything about the wide world he was always deferring to curse he was always
MCDM-612|deferring to variks there were several points in the adventure where Gertz turned to me as edrick and tried to get
MCDM-613|me to give him some clues as to what he should do but I never did I would give him several options but some of them
MCDM-614|would be crazy that forced Gertz to lead I got the sense that Gertz want to collaborate but
MCDM-615|I'm the DM don't collaborate with me lead be a leader be a hero and with edrick in tow it was kind of easy for
MCDM-616|vork us to be leader I know Eric's motivation which is survive follow forcas but now I need to know his
MCDM-617|mannerism I know what he would say now I need to know how he would say it I gave edrick and I kind of at the time thought
MCDM-618|of this as kind of cheating I gave edrick one mannerism and that is I gave him a stammer I watched a lot of I
MCDM-619|Claudius when I was a kid derek jacobi playing Claudius had a stammer so I just ripped that off you
MCDM-620|know derek jacobi the actor did a lot of work and study people that had a stammer wouldn't be comedic it wouldn't be
MCDM-621|disrespectful and I just stole it giving him a stammer giving this one kind of flamboyant mannerism unlocked all this
MCDM-622|other stuff about his personality that I didn't know until I was playing him he would be self-conscious of his damn er
MCDM-623|he would have issues with self-confidence he was constantly saying Devore Kasai I mean useless it was up to
MCDM-624|vork us to give him encouragement to say we're gonna make it you're gonna be okay and for Kurtz that made playing vork cos
MCDM-625|feel like playing a hero all that just from the stammer and I didn't worry about the self-confidence in the self
MCDM-626|loathing about that character until I was playing him he was born once I started playing him then when I stopped
MCDM-627|he died these were things I discovered as I was playing him based solely on the idea that he wanted to serve vork as he
MCDM-628|was a follower he want to get out of here alive and he had a stammer my last example and we're pretty close to the
MCDM-629|end of this video is a normal everyday peasant a farmer that the revenant vow met on their first adventure the players
MCDM-630|were first level in the adventure was against the cult of the reptile God we should probably do a series on the
MCDM-631|adventures that I have run and that I liked because if I tell you what I learned from running that adventure then
MCDM-632|you can run it and I will have saved you some time for my money against the cult of the reptile God is maybe the best
MCDM-633|starting adventure and it's all about this cult that has taken over a town when the players come to the town and
MCDM-634|against the cult of the reptile God they meet three kinds of NPCs first they meet normal everyday NPCs who just feel like
MCDM-635|our town is cursed and a lot of the people that I knew and grew up with are acting strange
MCDM-636|second they meet some of those people who are acting strange they're under the effect of a domination spell third they
MCDM-637|meet some of the bad guys in charge of this cult the ones who are putting the other NPCs under the domination spell
MCDM-638|but early on the players don't know this yet the first NPC the players met was a
MCDM-639|farmer they knew there was something going on in the town and they kind of used this farmer as a case study
MCDM-640|patient zero what's going on here in this town let's talk to this farmer so I thought about who is this guy he's a
MCDM-641|farmer he wants to provide for his family that's his goal that's what makes him toil all day in the Sun and I
MCDM-642|thought about how is he going to express himself what is this personality well that came from the way the PCs reacted I
MCDM-643|just made sure that this guy was incredibly deferential he wouldn't look the heroes in the eye if they asked
MCDM-644|questions he answered simply and didn't say any more than he had to because this guy has met adventures before he knows
MCDM-645|their trouble and he knows that the best thing to do is just leave them alone he thinks of adventures as being above him
MCDM-646|he's stuck here on a farm they can go travel the world yeah they're going to risk their lives doing crazy stuff but
MCDM-647|they're gonna make a lot of money doing it so from his point of view they're not noblemen but they are of a
MCDM-648|higher station than he is and anytime a peasant like him is interacted with them the best thing to do is just get out of
MCDM-649|there alive say as little as possible and try to make it out of the encounter alive that actually proved a little bit
MCDM-650|difficult because when he wasn't immediately forthcoming and open and just answer every question the heroes
MCDM-651|had they started to kind of get angry at him he was so deferential and monosyllabic that the players started to
MCDM-652|think maybe he is one of these dominated NPCs one of the players actually tried to provoke this farmer he would push him
MCDM-653|around flick his ear he'd dug up his vegetable garden and the funny thing about that was the more aggressive this
MCDM-654|PC this player character was the more convinced this farmer was that his beliefs regarding adventurers were right
MCDM-655|they are terrible people just leave them alone after the aggressive PC was done bullying this farmer the other players
MCDM-656|made him feel bad so the PC said well no hard feelings and through this farmer gold piece and the farmer literally does
MCDM-657|not react to the gold piece just falls in the dirt that was the farmers incredibly passive-aggressive way of
MCDM-658|telling the heroes to go screw I don't want your money once again I had created a dramatic
MCDM-659|situation I didn't really do it on purpose I just thought about what is this character's motivation and how does
MCDM-660|he express himself and at the end of that process we got to a point where one of the characters was bullying this guy
MCDM-661|and then as a kind of half-assed apology throws him a gold piece well that's exactly the kind of behavior that makes
MCDM-662|NPCs like this farmer hate adventures because all they think about is gold the gold piece itself became this kind of
MCDM-663|symbol for the relationship between adventurers and peasants and after that adventure that night I actually wrote up
MCDM-664|a whole scene I'll included in the doobly-doo covering what this farmer did immediately after encountering the
MCDM-665|heroes and I used it as an example to illustrate how bad things have gotten in the town a lot of people were leaving
MCDM-666|the town which is what the cultists wanted and that proved to be a very effective way to show the players how
MCDM-667|they were perceived and kind of motivate them to be better characters because after I wrote that thing they felt
MCDM-668|really bad for this farmer now in each instance I don't think any of those NPCs I just talked about were particularly
MCDM-669|flamboyant characters but they each provided memorable moments in the campaign because I focused on the
MCDM-670|characters motivation rather than some outrageous accent it grounded these characters and it made the world feel
MCDM-671|more real and it gave the players a lot of perspective on how they were perceived and how the world works
MCDM-672|hopefully some of this advice is useful but it's the advice I've got so if you have any questions please come by the
MCDM-673|comments and let me know maybe we'll do another video later NPCs part 2 I've had a couple people online
MCDM-674|plain isn't the right word but bring up the fact that we do fewer running the game videos now when we do campaign
MCDM-675|Diaries more and I talk about movies every once in a while I just want everybody know that like the campaign
MCDM-676|Diaries a lot of people like the campaign Diaries I think there's a lot of great DM advice in them and because
MCDM-677|we play every week and people are kind of engaged with the story I feel like I have to do those those are the minimum
MCDM-678|campaign Diaries I don't wanna get behind on and I don't want to skip any because then people who are watching
MCDM-679|they'll be like well wait what happened my goal is absolutely to continue doing running the game videos but the campaign
MCDM-680|Diaries are kind of the first video I have to make each week is how to D&D go that week and then sometimes I'm struck
MCDM-681|by an idea like I did that video on 2001 that a lot of people really liked but I know some people that's not what they
MCDM-682|come here for that's why I put all these videos in different playlists and I believe you can subscribe to the
MCDM-683|playlist you want otherwise the channel is called Matthew Colville it's not called how to be a better DM so you come
MCDM-684|here you get the kind of stuff I'm interested in I've had a couple of people actually following my campaign
MCDM-685|diary start doing their own campaign Diaries and I thought they were really cool i link to both of them in the
MCDM-686|doobly-doo I hope people do more I think the campaign diary and YouTube is a great way to memorialize your game plus
MCDM-687|who knows people like really engage with the story that's happening at your table that's it for the NPC video folks I hope
MCDM-688|there was some useful advice in there as usual there are no ads in front of my D&D content I do not have a patreon if
MCDM-689|you want to help support the channel I encourage you to come by my author page on Amazon there's a link in the
MCDM-690|doobly-doo I am an independent fantasy author that means I write fantasy novels and I sell them direct to you I am
MCDM-691|philosophically opposed to middleman it's one of the reasons I love YouTube I don't advertise my books in the movie
MCDM-692|stuff I do so you will see ads in front of those hopefully it's not too annoying until next time peace out
MCDM-693|it's well after midnight somewhere deep in the dungeon the players have chosen a room they already cleared out to hole up
MCDM-694|for the night and rest many of them are wounded they used up many spells they need to rest they need to spend the
MCDM-695|night in the dungeon fearful of the creatures that lurk outside they set up two watches two hours into the second
MCDM-696|watch check the door of an war priest with the high wisdom and therefore high perception here's something something
MCDM-697|outside the door he gestures to Nicodemus the half war fighter now count Nicodemus of rend Nicodemus looks from
MCDM-698|Keck to the door Nicodemus hasn't heard anything but he watches as Keck picks up his Moll and prepares for battle
MCDM-699|Nicodemus slowly and quietly stands up preparing his great two-handed war axe wound Keck presses his ear to the door
MCDM-700|and listens there is something without he says Nicodemus hisses keep your voice down
MCDM-701|what you hear on the other side of the door they hear a sound something sniffing they hear heavy footprints
MCDM-702|there's something just on the other side of the door that can smell them this is sniffing them out Keck wielding the
MCDM-703|two-handed Maul of zarach the lawgiver looks at Nicodemus and says we should attack should use the element of
MCDM-704|surprise Nicodemus looks down at the dwarf and says are you crazy wait Keck restrains
MCDM-705|himself they both listen at the door and they hear the sniffing sound move on whatever was on the other side of the
MCDM-706|door whatever was looking for them didn't find them and the night passes uneventful II that's because I asked the
MCDM-707|players to make two roles for random encounters I use a d12 I'll explain why later and I say if you roll an 11 or a
MCDM-708|12 there's a random encounter and the players rolled a 6 for the first watch and a 10 for the next watch so I just
MCDM-709|role played the process of something in the dungeon the players don't know what on patrol looking for them sniffing for
MCDM-710|them but in this case whatever was on the other side of the door whatever is looking for them didn't find them hey
MCDM-711|everybody matt covert here we're going to talk about some proper dungeon master advice this episode is about random
MCDM-712|encounters we're also going to do a giveaway at the end of the episode tied to a certain number of subscribers so
MCDM-713|stay tuned it's related to the map building stuff we've been doing on Twitch I hope you've had a chance to
MCDM-714|check it out if not don't worry I'm probably gonna make a video at the end summarizing the whole thing I didn't
MCDM-715|always use random encounters in my game in fact I know some dm's never use them I think it's purely down to your style
MCDM-716|of play and as a dungeon master my style of play changes almost with every campaign I run the game I'm currently
MCDM-717|running at Turtle Rock Studios is kind of a throwback to the old school way of running D&D we're just getting
MCDM-718|point A to point B is dangerous and that's where the idea of random encounters comes from so under no
MCDM-719|circumstance should you feel as though random encounters are something that you should use or have to use it is a tool
MCDM-720|in your toolbox and I really think it's down to your style of play it's something that either you do often in
MCDM-721|this campaign because you're going for a certain feel or it's something you hardly ever do because your game is more
MCDM-722|narrative focused it's more story driven we inherit the idea of random encounters from a game that existed before Dungeons
MCDM-723|& Dragons in fact if you went and bought the three little brown booklets the original version of D&D that was
MCDM-724|published in 1974 it explicitly told you that in order to play D&D you needed this other game actually needed two
MCDM-725|other games you needed chainmail in order to handle combat and then you needed something from another company
MCDM-726|entirely this was not a game that TSR made it was a game that they all owned and used from a company called Avalon
MCDM-727|Hill it was called outdoor survival there's a picture of it over here it was one of their bookcase game series not
MCDM-728|entirely unlike merchants of Venus which is a game I love I have lots of Avalon Hill bookcase games Avalon hills outdoor
MCDM-729|survival was its own self-contained game and it was a game that all the folks who ran and played Dungeons and Dragons back
MCDM-730|in 1974 all owned so it was an easy thing for them to just use it to deal with Overland movement you can see the
MCDM-731|outdoor survival map here was always the same map and the idea was that depending on the scenario you would start in one
MCDM-732|hex and your goal was to get remember hexes we're back to hexes you would start in one hacks and try to get to
MCDM-733|another hex and the farther away they were the harder it was to do and you would have to roll on these various
MCDM-734|charts to see what happened as you tried to go over these mountains or go through this forest and just getting from point
MCDM-735|A to point B was the entire game of outdoor survival the game they were playing was called Dungeons and Dragons
MCDM-736|the idea was that the game master designed a dungeon the rules explicitly tell the dungeon master you need to come
MCDM-737|up with six levels of dungeon before you start your first game the idea of playing in a city or playing in the
MCDM-738|wilderness or having an entire adventure just take place in the town did not occur to these guys when they first
MCDM-739|started the fun the juice of the game was exploring dungeons and each Game Master had his own dungeon we don't
MCDM-740|really play that way anymore but when you went from the dungeon back to town you would use this other game you would
MCDM-741|use outdoor survival to determine what happened when you got from the dungeon back to town
MCDM-742|just getting the loot the treasure that you got from the dungeon back to your town so you could spend it so you could
MCDM-743|use it was a big deal is considered an accomplishment that should explain a lot of how random encounters in Overland
MCDM-744|movement work and it also kind of explains some of the monsters in D&D there are lots of monsters and dungeons
MCDM-745|and dragons that you would probably never encounter if you never used overland movement random encounters in
MCDM-746|fact there used to be a stat monsters had a stat in the monster manual in the original Monster Manual and the stat was
MCDM-747|percent chance in lair the idea being if you encountered this monster as a result of an overland movement random encounter
MCDM-748|what are the odds that you came across it while it was in its lair you know it's a very different experience to
MCDM-749|fight a black dragon for instance on the wing so to speak it sees the players camp as it flies over hunting during the
MCDM-750|night that's one experience there the dragon kind of has the advantage it can swoop down it can breathe acid on you
MCDM-751|and it can fly away when it's wounded but fighting a black dragon in its lair is a very different experience for one
MCDM-752|thing that's where it's treasure is if you kill the black dragon because it attacked you while you were making camp
MCDM-753|in the middle of the forest then you probably didn't get any treasure as a result but if you fight it while it's in
MCDM-754|its lair then you will get treasure but the flipside of that is the black dragon can't really retreat this is its lair
MCDM-755|there's nowhere for it to retreat to so if you fight a black dragon out in the forest out in the wilderness in the
MCDM-756|middle of the night if things get too hairy for the heroes or if the black dragon gets too wounded the dragon can
MCDM-757|fly away not so in the lair so you get a sense of how built into the bones of Dungeons & Dragons random encounters are
MCDM-758|nowadays I think a lot of games are more narrative and story focused and so the idea of exploring of just getting from
MCDM-759|point A to point B being dangerous I don't think we use that I think it's somewhat unfashionable it is mentioned
MCDM-760|in the Dungeon Master's guide and there are other uses for it besides just making overland movement difficult
MCDM-761|random encounters are also incredibly useful in the dungeon in fact I think they are probably used in the dungeon
MCDM-762|these days more than for Overland movement I think in this day and age if you're just trying to get from point A
MCDM-763|to point B the only stuff that will happen to you is stuff that the dungeon master has already cooked up like
MCDM-764|somebody ambushes you like maybe bandits ambushed you it depends on the adventure you're running even dungeon crawls I
MCDM-765|think in this day and age or somewhat out of fashion I still use them I love dungeon crawls I
MCDM-766|probably always will but a lot of adventures these days are more narrative and story focused so the bad guys that
MCDM-767|you're fighting aren't all you know collected in some underground complex so it tells you
MCDM-768|a lot about me as a dungeon master that I am running a game that not only features dungeons like proper
MCDM-769|underground complexes but also making Overland Movement dangerous I am deliberately running a game that is a
MCDM-770|kind of throwback to the games they ran in 70s in the 80s because I have a kind of nostalgia for that even though I only
MCDM-771|started playing in the mid to late 80s I have this crazy nostalgia for an era that I didn't belong to we need a word
MCDM-772|for that in English nostalgia for an era that you weren't a part of so you may find that like wilderness survival a
MCDM-773|dungeons aren't to your taste which is fine but if you do use dungeons if you do have players exploring these
MCDM-774|underground complexes or castles or whatever where there are several combat encounters in a row and there's no way
MCDM-775|for the players to do it all in one day then it may be useful for you to use random encounters because ultimately the
MCDM-776|idea of exploring this underground complex of dealing with all these monsters that are all grouped together
MCDM-777|is a question of resource management players are of course risk-averse they want to risk as little as possible so if
MCDM-778|you give them the chance they will rest they'll take a long rest after every encounter I mean why not realistically
MCDM-779|speaking if you had to fight a bunch of orcs in order to survive just one encounter with orcs would probably wipe
MCDM-780|you out and you would say you know what let's stop and rest until we are fully healthy and have all our spells back so
MCDM-781|random encounters in the dungeon are a way to counter that desire it is a perfectly natural desire there was
MCDM-782|nothing wrong with the players deciding that they want to spend the night after the first encounter but you want to
MCDM-783|discourage that because it robs the adventure of tension and that's the whole point of doing this is drama right
MCDM-784|tension and resolution random encounters also reinforce the idea that the world is a dangerous place that the dungeon is
MCDM-785|dangerous to explore and that the wilderness is dangerous to explore of course this has to scale by level a
MCDM-786|ninth level party probably no longer worries about getting ambushed by goblins in the middle of the forest in
MCDM-787|fact a nice level party probably has lots of ways of getting from point A to point B that do not involve walking
MCDM-788|there so to a certain extent the idea of overland movement causing random encounters is based on the hero's being
MCDM-789|somewhat low level so let's talk about how I do it let's talk about how I run random encounters and of course if
MCDM-790|you've watched my videos you should know that I am NOT saying this is the right way to do it it's not it's not even the
MCDM-791|only way I have done it it's just the way I'm doing it right now typically the players start in town and
MCDM-792|they have some rumors so I'm word someone they've met that has told them about someplace out in the
MCDM-793|wilderness that is relevant to their interests like there's a goblin mine in the swamp or like those are ruined keep
MCDM-794|in the forest and the players can count the number of hexes between where they're starting where they're trying to
MCDM-795|get to and again we're back to hexes right now you're starting to understand why I like them they provide a nice
MCDM-796|little unit of measurement the players count the number of hexes and I have them make one roll for every wilderness
MCDM-797|hex they move through now that means if they're going a long way away if they're going 10x is 240 miles away they're
MCDM-798|gonna be making 10 rolls which is why I tend to have all the wilderness stuff near where the players are so let's
MCDM-799|imagine that the place they're trying to get to is 5 hexes away from the town they're starting in that means they have
MCDM-800|to make 5 rolls that's 5 chances for them to have a random encounter there are lots of ways to determine whether or
MCDM-801|not there was a random encounter in the woods and in fact I've played games where it was modified by whether or not
MCDM-802|there was a ranger in the party Rangers made it less likely that there would be a random encounter and in fact I also
MCDM-803|think that in the players handbook actual Rangers and fifth addition are impossible to surprise in their favorite
MCDM-804|terrain which is fantastic and actually at one point resulted in the players making different decisions when they
MCDM-805|traveled which i think is neat they went through the forest instead of taking the road because they had a ranger with them
MCDM-806|whose favourite terrain was forest and they were told that the road was dangerous that there were bandits on the
MCDM-807|road and in fact if they had taken the road they would have been ambushed by bandits but they listened to the Ranger
MCDM-808|who said we should go through the forest and as a result there was no encounter but typically what I do is for every hex
MCDM-809|they're moving through in the wilderness this doesn't count typically on roads or in civilization every hex they're moving
MCDM-810|through in the wilderness I have them roll a 12-sided die because I just like 12 sided dice and I don't think they get
MCDM-811|used that much they just use a six sided die back in the 70s and I think if you got a six there was a random encounter
MCDM-812|so if they're moving through five wilderness hexes I tell the players to roll five times and they get a random
MCDM-813|encounter if they get an 11 or 12 why 11 or 12 on a 12 sided die I don't know I just made it up I think it's because it
MCDM-814|harkens back to that old-school d6 way of doing things and I tell the players if you roll an 11 you're going to be on
MCDM-815|one sharp but if you roll a 12 then you get a harder encounter right rolling higher on the 12 side died rolling a 12
MCDM-816|is more dangerous so I imply that there are two charts for each type of train there is the easy chart and the
MCDM-817|difficult chart and it depends what they roll what chart they get and of course there's a 10 and 12 or a 5 and 6 chance
MCDM-818|that nothing happens now if you know me if you and paying attention you may have
MCDM-819|guessed I have no charts that notion the thing I lied my players I literally say that there is a different chart for an
MCDM-820|eleven versus a twelve but there are no charts I just want them to feel like these things are objective that these
MCDM-821|are the rules of the world that this isn't just something matt has made up so I lie and I say that if they roll an 11
MCDM-822|they get the easy chart if they roll a 12 they get the difficult chart got 1 through 10 nothing happens but the trick
MCDM-823|here is if they get an encounter once they get an encounter then that's it we deal with the encounter and they don't
MCDM-824|have to roll anymore the goal of the random encounter during Overland movement is just to make the world feel
MCDM-825|dangerous it's not to maximize how many bad guys they fight so once they get a random encounter we resolve it and then
MCDM-826|I take it easy on them and I say ok you manage to reach your destination the funny thing though is even though I made
MCDM-827|up the idea that there are two different charts a hard one if they roll a 12 and an easy one if they roll in 11 there
MCDM-828|actually is a tool online which we'll look at in a minute that has easy moderate and difficult charts you can
MCDM-829|roll on and now I use that so first I made it up and then I discovered that there was a tool online that made my
MCDM-830|nonsense seem real that's the great thing about running D&D in this day and age is whatever problem you're trying to
MCDM-831|solve other people lots of other people have tried to solve this problem and someone has probably created a tool to
MCDM-832|make it easy now I say there are two charts one easy and one difficult but even the easy chart is somewhat nasty
MCDM-833|the idea being that a random encounter that happens in the wilderness should be challenging it needs to be challenging
MCDM-834|otherwise it's a waste of time because the players will quickly learn they will conclude rightly that this is the only
MCDM-835|thing they're going to do that day when you're traveling through the wilderness days pass and nothing happens so if they
MCDM-836|encounter a bad guy out here in the middle of the forest the players know this is probably the only bad guy we're
MCDM-837|going to encounter let's use all our resources let's cast all our spells let's use our wild shape let's do
MCDM-838|everything now I have the players role once per hex but I have in the past and I've played with other DMS that have
MCDM-839|them role once period and modify the role by the number of hexes so maybe if you move far enough you guarantee the
MCDM-840|idea that you're going to get an encounter that's down to taste it makes perfect sense to me the idea that you're
MCDM-841|going to roll one die it's less die rolling right but I think players like rolling dice that's one of the reasons I
MCDM-842|have the players roll for the random encounters I could do it behind the screen and a lot of DMS do but I like
MCDM-843|the idea that their fate is in their hands so I tell the players to roll if they're traveling through many hexes
MCDM-844|then that might mean a lot of rolls and maybe for you it makes more sense if they all make one roll
MCDM-845|and then modify it by the number of hexes they're moving through or the number of miles they travel if you don't
MCDM-846|like hexes and in that case I probably wouldn't use the d12 I would probably use percentile dice because I would
MCDM-847|still want to be possible for nothing to happen so you might say there is a 25% chance of you guys getting a random
MCDM-848|encounter maybe it's down to terrain maybe it's 20% into 4 is 25% in the mountains and then modify it by one
MCDM-849|percent or three percent for every hex they move through that would make it unlikely that you'd ever end up in a
MCDM-850|situation where you would be guaranteed to get a random encounter because that would make it not very random but of
MCDM-851|course random encounters are also random because a you don't know if one is going to happen and then B you don't know what
MCDM-852|you're going to fight so there are lots of charts online there's a tool we'll look at in a minute for generating a
MCDM-853|random encounter but I have often pretended to roll on a chart behind the screen but really I'm just looking
MCDM-854|through the monster manual to see what's cool and my idea of what is fun to use in a random encounter is affected by the
MCDM-855|fact that some of the monsters in the monster manual you're probably never going to encounter unless you have
MCDM-856|random encounters out in the wilderness like the players were trying to get from point A to point B in my Thursday night
MCDM-857|game they had a random encounter and I decided to use a wyvern now of course I told them I rolled randomly but I didn't
MCDM-858|I just thought oh we Verne's are cool when was the last time I used one I may never use one let's use one tonight and
MCDM-859|it was a lot of fun actually it was the first time the players had had any kind of random encounter out in the
MCDM-860|wilderness and they learned a lot for instance when they found out when they decided to make camp that night they
MCDM-861|found out that side the elven Ranger he's an elf he doesn't need to sleep he just meditates and they were like well
MCDM-862|does that mean we don't need to take watch and they're like yeah I don't think that mean I think that the elf can
MCDM-863|basically watch for us cuz half the night he doesn't need to sleep and the other half he's just sitting there
MCDM-864|meditating so let's all just go to that which meant when the wyvern attacked only Sai was awake he was the only one
MCDM-865|in his armor everyone else was asleep and unarmored and that's when they found out it takes like 10 minutes to put your
MCDM-866|armor on I didn't give them any advice in this regard I let them play the way they wanted to they were very low level
MCDM-867|characters and this was how they learned to set watch because once you've said watches you have characters that begin
MCDM-868|battle in their armor super useful I had a lot of fun with that encounter watching the players scramble around
MCDM-869|trying to deal with the fact that only one of them had any armor on and a wyvern is an incredibly nasty thing to
MCDM-870|throw up against a low level party but I reasoned thusly wise yes it is a powerful bad guy and it may indeed very
MCDM-871|badly wound one of the heroes I made sure it didn't kill anybody but once the heroes had
MCDM-872|done enough damaged it I had it fly away because it's a wild animal it's out looking for food it sees some
MCDM-873|defenseless humans it decides to try to eat them once they put up enough of a fight I haven't leaved
MCDM-874|so this is one of the kind of interesting side effects of using a high-level monster as part of a random
MCDM-875|encounter if it attacks the heroes while they've made camp and are just spending the night then once it's taken enough
MCDM-876|damage it's going to run away I still award full experience in a situation like that because the players dealt with
MCDM-877|the random encounter but if the players come across the monster in its lair while they're traveling from point A to
MCDM-878|point B then the players have all the power the players are in a position to opt in to decide whether or not to go
MCDM-879|after this monster it's a very tough monster because that's the nature of a random encounter but it's with its
MCDM-880|treasure it's in its lair the players get a greater reward if they beat it and because the players have come upon the
MCDM-881|monster in its lair they have the advantage they have the opportunity to get all the information they want and
MCDM-882|they have the element of surprise it's time to put on your makeup and then missing a huge opportunity here because
MCDM-883|we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise so what could be more surprising than
MCDM-884|the first Battalion transvestite burgade so that's how I handle encounters in Overland movement the players in my
MCDM-885|campaign in one group their fourth level in another group their sixth level and I think the sixth level party is basically
MCDM-886|done with random encounters in the Overland they have their own method for getting from point A to point B that
MCDM-887|means they don't have to go through the forest they don't have to roll dice for every X and they're now high enough
MCDM-888|level that other stuff is going to start trying to avoid them this process of the player is kind of outgrowing random
MCDM-889|encounters also helps them feel like they've accomplished something like they've grown and developed as heroes
MCDM-890|the kind of stuff that used to really challenge them when they were first second third level now doesn't even
MCDM-891|happen anymore it's another thing that happens when you play D&D for a while you get a high
MCDM-892|level character you start missing that earlier kind of play where being low level you worried about just getting
MCDM-893|from point A to point B on the one hand it's an accomplishment when you don't have to worry about it anymore on the
MCDM-894|other hand it's a fun sense of accomplishment when you actually do it when you actually make it from point A
MCDM-895|to point B and deal with the random encounter using these creatures like with runes and we'll the wisps in their
MCDM-896|native environment and the wilderness makes the world feel richer and more plausible because the types of creatures
MCDM-897|the players encounter are widened not only are there creatures down here where this is their native environment and
MCDM-898|you're just moving through their home and that's why they're attacking you they're hungry they're looking for food
MCDM-899|the game also includes guys up here crazy things like B holders and mind flayers a game that has a wide variety
MCDM-900|of different bad guys to fight in different environments I think is a game that feels more plausible and more
MCDM-901|grounded which is again down to your style of play in the dungeon or whatever kind of underground complex they were
MCDM-902|dealing with or above-ground it could be a castle or a temple but anytime the players are trying to clear out a lot of
MCDM-903|rooms that are full of bad guys a place that has multiple levels the players are going to very quickly decide that they
MCDM-904|want to rest because they want to minimize risk now this is a very different experience than the overland
MCDM-905|movement thing or they're just trying to get from point A to point B here they're in a dungeon they're fighting for their
MCDM-906|lives they're questing after some bad guy they're trying to stop or some treasure they're trying to acquire and
MCDM-907|especially if you have new players after the first encounter they might say well I just took a lot of damage or I'm out
MCDM-908|of spells let's stop not let's rest for an hour let's spend the night and if they do
MCDM-909|that then it kind of removes the tension from the game so it's your job as the dungeon master to put the tension back
MCDM-910|in and that's one of the things random encounters are great for and I think sometimes just the threat of
MCDM-911|a random encounter is enough to keep the players going but again you want the random encounters in the dungeon to be
MCDM-912|nastier than the normal things they would be dealing with otherwise they'll just opt for the random encounter if the
MCDM-913|random encounters are skeletons but the stuff they're fighting in the dungeon is ghouls and whites then of course the
MCDM-914|players will stop and rest because they'd rather fight skeletons in the random encounter than ghouls and whites
MCDM-915|while they explore so that's another piece of advice whatever you're dealing with in the adventure the random
MCDM-916|encounter should be nastier because it disincentivizes the players from stopping and the way I do it is if they
MCDM-917|take a short rest they roll once if they take a long rest they roll twice once for each watch now that doesn't make any
MCDM-918|literal sense and my players always say wait a minute if it's one check for a short rest on a short rest as an hour
MCDM-919|shouldn't that mean eight checks for a long rest because a long rest is eight hours and indeed you could do that if
MCDM-920|you want but I think eight checks is pretty unforgiving so I say no it's it's once per watch as Dungeon Master's it's
MCDM-921|up to us to control the pacing of the game just because it's one check for one hour during a short rest doesn't mean
MCDM-922|it's eight checks for a long rest that's eight hours that would be pretty tedious and that's why I like tying into watches
MCDM-923|I say there are two watches who's on first watch who's on second watch and I have each watch roll random
MCDM-924|encounters on the dungeon also incentivized the players to look at the dungeon
MCDM-925|more like a battlefield more like this is a thing they are exploring this is a thing they're moving through when they
MCDM-926|clear out one room they think to themselves this is a easily defensible place we should remember this for when
MCDM-927|we have to sleep we'll come back here and we'll borrow the door or one of the things that players ask about is on the
MCDM-928|list of things they can buy our Pitons they're like one of these things I'm like well there's a little metal spikes
MCDM-929|that you can hammer into a rock cliff face if you need to climb but they're all so easily used as spikes that you
MCDM-930|hammer under the door between the gap that's where the door on the floor to hammer a door shut if the bad guys find
MCDM-931|them in the middle of the night the fact that the door has been spiked shut means the players are going to get a couple of
MCDM-932|rounds where they can get ready prepare spells wake their sleeping allies up put on their armor before the bad guys
MCDM-933|inevitably burst through the door and there's a lot of tension there as the bad guys start attacking the door the
MCDM-934|heroes can see the door is starting to break and splinter under the assault now of course if your players have a long
MCDM-935|adventuring day and you feel as though a random encounter is too nasty for them then you roll behind the screen don't
MCDM-936|have them roll and take it easy on them roll 1 or 2 or just you know roll a d4 and ignore it
MCDM-937|random encounters are purely a tool that you can use to make the world feel more dangerous more threatening which in some
MCDM-938|ways makes it feel more plausible and control the pacing of the adventure the pacing of the game and kind of
MCDM-939|disincentivize your players from playing in the most risk-averse way possible I found a great tool for generating random
MCDM-940|encounters that I have actually used in the middle of my campaign I just looked for andum Leon line and found and I
MCDM-941|really liked it there's a link to it in the doobly-do you may have found your own random encounter resources online or
MCDM-942|you made your own in which case please link to them in the comments the more the merrier let's take a look at how
MCDM-943|this random encounter generator works and how I use ok this is the tool that I have found to use online for generating
MCDM-944|random encounters I feel it's pretty straightforward easy to use and I told my players when they roll an 11 they get
MCDM-945|the easy chart when they roll a 12 they roll the hard chart so I use hard or deadly here this tool lets pick hard and
MCDM-946|let's imagine that we were using this for the Thursday night group which is six fourth level players so I'm just
MCDM-947|going to go level four add player that's one two three four five six and they are moving through let's imagine they're
MCDM-948|moving through the hills it's going to do its best to try to pick monsters based on the environment that I've
MCDM-949|chosen minimum number of monster and chances we can do single types so they fight one type of something like lots of
MCDM-950|bugs or mixed types I think mixed types is cool I own the monster manual I don't just
MCDM-951|own the basic rules so we choose the monster manual you can pick a seed monster and it will do its best to say
MCDM-952|well an adult black dragon and what else what hangs out with an adult black dragon but here I'll say no seed
MCDM-953|monsters 15 seems like a lot so let's reduce the max number of monsters to 6 and generate a random encounter in suit
MCDM-954|we get four six fourth level heroes out in the Hills right oh they fight a stone golem okay that is super cool but I
MCDM-955|don't know what a stone golem is doing I mean a golem out in the middle of the but but that question why is there a
MCDM-956|Gollum Gollum is an automat on it's a construct it only follows orders it must have a master golem must have a master
MCDM-957|so there's probably a wizard or something or maybe the golem has escaped from some dungeon that's nearby and that
MCDM-958|to me is super cool although you could just take this remember there's no virtue in using the output of this as is
MCDM-959|it's not like the this tool has any great insight if you look at stone golem and go no that's too crazy what about a
MCDM-960|stone giant right stone giant stone golem don't have anything in common but the one reminded you of the other and
MCDM-961|you felt like the stones it was cool so why not use it let's see what I get if I generate another
MCDM-962|encounter cool a bunch of ores there are two orc eyes of Grunch there's an o raagh which is a kind of work two of
MCDM-963|them and there's one regular work and you might change it up you might say no I think there's three orcs one or AAG
MCDM-964|and one eye of Grunch there's no there's no reason to exactly use the numbers they've given you this is just a tool to
MCDM-965|inspire you let's see what happened I mean these are pretty cool encounters actually I like these four berserkers uh
MCDM-966|what does the berserker I think it's in the appendix to the Monster Manual what else might we get for Griffins I think a
MCDM-967|bunch of Griffin's like a patrol like a like a flock of Griffin's would be a great idea for a random
MCDM-968|encounter let's change it to underground right so now we're in a dungeon and let's click deadly the players rolled a
MCDM-969|12 on their 12 sided die what do they get this is going to be crazy let's see we get to psych off C's that reminds me
MCDM-970|of my favorite joke which is from Yellow Submarine hey there's a cyclops um but he's got two eyes or must be a bicycle
MCDM-971|ops it's a bicycle ops I love that so two Cyclops is in a dungeon that sort of makes sense although I might just go
MCDM-972|cyclopses or things I expect to find in the hills of the mountains let's try again ooh three black puddings let me
MCDM-973|tell you one black pudding is enough three black puddings is crazy but it's up to you how many black puddings to use
MCDM-974|black pudding is definitely something I would expect to find in a dungeon and it makes a great random encounter because
MCDM-975|it can get under the door so it because that's it's an it's just it's just a fungus on the ground so the players even
MCDM-976|if they've spiked the door shut the black pudding can still attack them I love that idea let's see what else might
MCDM-977|we get a bunch of orcs and a Manticore they keep these orcs and their Warchief keep this Manticore as a pet again why
MCDM-978|are there orcs in the dungeon isn't an orcish dungeon maybe if not if i feel as though i don't
MCDM-979|know that there were orcs down here I just clicked generate encounter again and I get a vampire that is a heart that
MCDM-980|is a deadly encounter that is definitely a deadly encounter what is the vampire doing down here well one of the things
MCDM-981|now I might just dismiss that or I might actually use it because one of the things I like about old-school
MCDM-982|adventures is that for instance I believe in against the cult of the reptile god the bad guy explicit to
MCDM-983|codify Ellis is in her lair she's asleep on a pile of coins but you might encounter her Elle
MCDM-984|we're in the dungeon she doesn't just stay in one place she goes on Patrol she visits her minions she gives them orders
MCDM-985|right she needs food so you might encounter the bad guy of this adventure not in his lair not in the final room
MCDM-986|not in the last room of the adventure and it might give the players an opportunity to encounter this bad guy
MCDM-987|fight them and then the bad guy retreats or the players retreat and now they have some information about who the bad guy
MCDM-988|is and how the bad guy operates I think that stuff is cool let's do one more I love random encounters this is fun
MCDM-989|this tool is neat is fun to use and it is also a great opportunity to be inspired as a dungeon master you don't
MCDM-990|have to use a vampire you could use a Janos Fink's our guy knows thinks it's a girl's Fink's Andros Fink's and guy
MCDM-991|knows Fink's and I think that you know what is one of these things doing wandering around they used to call
MCDM-992|wandering monsters I don't know let's see what else a flames call three flames calls that sounds cool a bunch of undead
MCDM-993|patrolling I think that's a cool idea especially in a dungeon the idea that there's a bunch of undead patrolling
MCDM-994|around so that's the random encounter episode I'll put a link to the tool in the doobly-doo it's up to you whether or
MCDM-995|not use random encounters and how you use them I hope you can see that I use them kind of I have a system but my
MCDM-996|system is kind of ad-hoc thanks for watching I hope that was useful I think random encounters are a great tool for
MCDM-997|new DMS to use we've been doing a lot of world-building and twitch on the weekends on Sunday at 11 o'clock we'll
MCDM-998|do another stream this coming up Sunday at 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time for this world building we've been doing in
MCDM-999|twitch I've been using hex OGG refer which I really like I enjoy using hex OGG refer because I like those
MCDM-1000|old-school kind of maps I've done maps by hand I've done maps in campaign cartographer but for this campaign for
MCDM-1001|this setting that I'm running right now I like that old-school feel and hex ographers a lot of fun to use it can
MCDM-1002|generate like a random world and it does its best to kind of figure out where mountain ranges would go and where
MCDM-1003|forests should be it's not literally just random terrain everywhere so in the spirit of the twitch building a world
MCDM-1004|stream and because I like the software and because I actually like contests and giving stuff away I am going to give
MCDM-1005|away a free copy you'll get serial numbers for every product that company inkwell ideas makes they make hex Agra
MCDM-1006|fur they make dungeon Agra fur which we talked about earlier they makes it iographer so you can make cities and
MCDM-1007|they have a great heraldry tool if you want to create your own heraldry so we just hit 14,000 subscribers a couple
MCDM-1008|days ago let's do the giveaway when we hit 17,000 subscribers and it's going to work the way it worked when we gave away
MCDM-1009|the meteoric iron day 20 or one who comments below is entered to win and once we hit 17,000 subscribers I'm
MCDM-1010|going to randomly draw someone the winner gets a copy of hex Agra fir dungeon Agra fir and Sid iographer and
MCDM-1011|their heraldry tool so you can make coats of arms for your world and that's about a hundred bucks actually you know
MCDM-1012|the last giveaway was a die that was worth two hundred bucks so let's give away two copies of each of those pieces
MCDM-1013|of software we'll have two winners I'll draw two names from the entries down below everybody who comments is entered
MCDM-1014|once we hit 17,000 subscribers I'll pick two people and each of them will get one copy of each of those pieces of software
MCDM-1015|so the faster we get to 17,000 subscribers the fewer comments there will be in the more likely it is that
MCDM-1016|you'll win so feel free to share this channel share this video share some other video share the alignment video
MCDM-1017|share the your first adventure video it's up to you I'm a big believer in social media I love it I'm on Twitter
MCDM-1018|all the time I'm on reddit you can follow me on Twitter at Matt Colville I'm also Matt Koval on twitch that was
MCDM-1019|the random encounters episode I hope it was useful as always there are no ads on this channel I don't have a patreon if
MCDM-1020|you want to help support the channel come by my amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo I'm an independent
MCDM-1021|fantasy author I have two novels out I'm working on my third novel a lot of people have bought them and some people
MCDM-1022|seem to like them there's not gonna be a campaign diary this week I don't think because the two groups I have at Turtle
MCDM-1023|Rock Studios I am merging into one group because with the advent of this YouTube channel I basically don't have time to
MCDM-1024|run for two campaigns so I'm gonna run one campaign and the good news for you is I am going to film our campaign film
MCDM-1025|I'm going to shoot I'm gonna record our games and you're gonna meet all the players and I'm going to use that I'm
MCDM-1026|not gonna stream them so you're not just gonna be able to sit there and watch us play for four hours not yet I think
MCDM-1027|we'll probably get there but in the first instance I'm just gonna put a camera on the players a camera on me and
MCDM-1028|I'm going to record the sessions and then I'm going to cut them down and use them as b-roll for future videos so
MCDM-1029|we'll be able to actually talk about the meat and potatoes of running the game as I am doing it actual lessons from the
MCDM-1030|table rather than some of this abstract Theory stuff but it's gonna take me about a week I think to figure out how
MCDM-1031|to bring the two groups together we might play this week stay tuned that's it for this episode next episode I think
MCDM-1032|is going to be one for the players I've talked about doing this before I want to do a welcome to D&D episode that is just
MCDM-1033|for new players because I think there are a lot of unspoken unwritten assumptions that reading The Player's
MCDM-1034|Handbook or reading the basic rules will not explain a lot of things we take for granted and
MCDM-1035|want to kind of pull the veil back and explain those things until next time peace out
MCDM-1036|wait wait wait wait no no no don't go I don't go I don't go I don't I'm here I'm here everything's fine everything's fine
MCDM-1037|we're all we're all fine down here how are you everybody Matt Koval here I know it's been like a month since the last
MCDM-1038|video I hope it won't be a month before the next one but I'm still super busy I'm about 3/4 of the way through the
MCDM-1039|secret project and then on to the stronghold rules but once all that stuff is wrapped up we're gonna go back to
MCDM-1040|making lots of Dena tea videos I promise I'm just super busy and I hope you'll put up with it for a little while longer
MCDM-1041|if you want to keep tabs on me and what I'm doing come follow me on Twitter or my subreddit slash are slash Matt Koval
MCDM-1042|there'll be links in the doobly-doo I just posted a long thread on reddit saying hey here's what I've been up to
MCDM-1043|just FYI keeping people abreast of what's going on I know I said the next video is going to be prepping an
MCDM-1044|adventure but that is a very production heavy video I already started working on it but it means me spending a lot of
MCDM-1045|time recording my process recording my screen and then going back and editing all of it and doing voiceover for it and
MCDM-1046|so that's probably that's not this video and it might be the next video we'll see this video is a sequel to an earlier
MCDM-1047|video and it's prompted by me texting a friend of mine and asking him what the days of the week in his campaign are
MCDM-1048|called and he responded and said I don't know I never really thought about it that surprised me only because he's been
MCDM-1049|working on this campaign setting for like 20 years and from my point of view at that point you should have probably
MCDM-1050|figured out what your calendar is but that just betrays the difference between the kind of game he runs the kind of
MCDM-1051|game I run this video is about time and specific as of that time it's specifically about calendars and the
MCDM-1052|usage and tracking of time and we're gonna start with a statement a somewhat controversial statement made back in the
MCDM-1053|70s by the progenitor of our hobby Gary Gygax Gary Gygax had a lot of different and often contradictory things about
MCDM-1054|running and playing D&D but they only they were contradictory because he was saying them at different
MCDM-1055|points in his career and there was certainly a point where Dungeons & Dragons was being challenged by
MCDM-1056|third-party companies companies that weren't making an original game they were making products for Dungeons &
MCDM-1057|Dragons and Gary couldn't stop them but he wanted to discourage people from buying them so he was he would say stuff
MCDM-1058|like if you're not playing with official TSR products then you're not playing the real game right and then he would have
MCDM-1059|to say stuff like if you're not playing with every single rule in the book then you're not playing the
MCDM-1060|game because he wanted people to buy his books and on other books and it was a purely business decision I think it's
MCDM-1061|safe to dismiss a lot of those statements because they came from the head of the company not the designer and
MCDM-1062|Dungeon Master by and large and so much Wow super glad to be back and have machine working yeah you know I think I
MCDM-1063|think we can largely ignore a lot of the stuff gary said late in his career focus on the stuff he said early in the 70s
MCDM-1064|back when you could just call the dude up a lot of people did this they would just go get they didn't know how to play
MCDM-1065|the game it was kind of weird it was a game unlike any other they would just go get a phone book from Wisconsin and look
MCDM-1066|up Gygax comic Gary and call the dude up and he would answer and the refrain you would get from people who had talked to
MCDM-1067|him and had and put questions in front of him about scenarios that came up that they didn't feel were covered the answer
MCDM-1068|he would give to questions like that was well what did you do right that's how Gary thought back when he was designing
MCDM-1069|the game he felt like it was his job to empower you the dungeon master to make your own rulings and then the rulings
MCDM-1070|you made at your table were just as valid as the ones in the book so those of us running and playing in the 80s
MCDM-1071|would hear these statements from Gary and some of them sounded super encouraging make it up what do you think
MCDM-1072|and then some of them would be really dogmatic and didactic and we couldn't figure out how did the same person say
MCDM-1073|all these things but later on you find out that oh these are the things he was saying when he felt like his company was
MCDM-1074|under attack throw those out but one statement he made it was difficult to tell where in the spectrum it fell it
MCDM-1075|was somewhat notorious caused a lot of arguments online largely I think by people who misinterpreted it this is a
MCDM-1076|statement we would read this from Gary he would say in the Dungeon Master's guide from 1979 you cannot have a
MCDM-1077|meaningful campaign if already this is a super controversial state right what is he gonna say I can't my campaign is
MCDM-1078|worthless unless unless what if strict time records are not kept Wow what what what is he talking about
MCDM-1079|because certainly lots of people have run D&D and had a lot of fun and been completely vague and you know about the
MCDM-1080|time and how much time has passed and it wasn't clear when you just got that statement out of context what do you
MCDM-1081|mean did he mean like tracking minutes and seconds and combat and hours or did he mean days and weeks and months as
MCDM-1082|controversial as that statement is I'm gonna say maybe equally controversially that I think
MCDM-1083|is basically right but that's because I'm taking the statement in the context it was meant which is back in 1979 in
MCDM-1084|the Dungeon Master's guide he's talking about time in your campaign and certainly I mean I I do not follow this
MCDM-1085|advice but I believe my campaign would be better if I did Gary is not talking about tracking minutes and seconds and
MCDM-1086|hours he's talking about tracking days and weeks and months because the passage of time for it from his point of view
MCDM-1087|and I largely agree it is the passage of time which lends drama to the events now this was more true back in 1979 where
MCDM-1088|the only way apart from clerics healing you the only way to recover hitpoints was by resting and you recovered back in
MCDM-1089|1979 one hit point per day and I remember my friends and I thinking well surely it's one hit point plus a
MCDM-1090|constitution nope it was one hit point I think there was a rule in second edition D&E where if he didn't go anywhere if
MCDM-1091|you stayed bedridden all day you would recover three hit points per day but again there was no concession made to
MCDM-1092|your Constitution or anything like that so back in the day recovering hit points leaving the dungeon spending time
MCDM-1093|outside of the dungeon to recover your hit points was critical to healing but even in later editions even in third or
MCDM-1094|fourth or fifth edition D&D I believe that it is the passage of time that lends weight to the proceedings and I'm
MCDM-1095|reminded of this when I read for instance the Lord of the Rings or I recommend a series of books by Tolkien
MCDM-1096|son Christopher Tolkien called the history of the Lord of the Rings it's a three and a half volume series of books
MCDM-1097|that are inside the much larger history of middle-earth and in the history of the Lord of the Rings Christopher
MCDM-1098|Tolkien details the the process of writing the Lord of the Rings I should do a whole video just on that because it
MCDM-1099|is fascinating but one of the things Tolkien was obsessed by and he spent a substantive percentage of his entire
MCDM-1100|time writing was figuring out the calendar and the days of the week and where everyone in the Fellowship was at
MCDM-1101|different points in the story this makes sense when you consider that early on in the Lord the ring was talking to
MCDM-1102|something crazy that any like writing teacher would have told him not to do and that is he splits the party he sends
MCDM-1103|half the party to Minas Tirith and he sends the other half into Mordor and he wanted a attentive player player he
MCDM-1104|wanted an attentive reader to notice and be able to tell where each group was in the process by
MCDM-1105|tracking things like the phases of the Moon now this is crazy and I do not recommend it but he wanted to know that
MCDM-1106|when Frodo and company were here on September 29th for instance the Aragorn on company
MCDM-1107|would be here and they would be seeing the same stars in the same phase of the Moon he was super worried and I'm not
MCDM-1108|sure why I don't think he needed to be he was super worried about the fact that the fellowship departed they split up
MCDM-1109|and then they get back together again and that an attentive reader might discover that this span of time was
MCDM-1110|shorter than the span of time and he would say that doesn't make any sense so tracking time and calendars and days and
MCDM-1111|weeks was super important to Tolkien and I think it is something that all of our campaigns would benefit from even though
MCDM-1112|like I said I don't do it I have done in the past and every time every campaign were I have strictly tracked time there
MCDM-1113|was a noticeable increase in the sense of reality right verisimilitude the illusion of reality because without
MCDM-1114|tracking days and weeks and months suddenly you discover that your characters have gone from first level to
MCDM-1115|ninth level but technically it's only been like seven days or you know maybe twenty days or thirty days it doesn't
MCDM-1116|matter the point is the players have this sense that surely months and maybe a year or more have passed since we work
MCDM-1117|you know farmers and sailors and mercenaries but then when you sit down and actually try to go back and review
MCDM-1118|how much time you've spent you can't account for it and it turns out that maybe you've done all this adventuring
MCDM-1119|in just a couple of days and that makes it seem less significant again this is just my opinion but it explains for
MCDM-1120|instance why I use hex a graph I showed you my maps in hex are here's one of them this is the campaign map I'm
MCDM-1121|currently using and obviously the reason I do in hex Agra fur one reason is because I'm not an artist and hex Agra
MCDM-1122|fur allows me to very quickly make what is obviously a fantasy map of my campaign and that saves me a lot of time
MCDM-1123|and it looks good enough that I'm not embarrassed to hand it out to my players that's the other thing not an artist and
MCDM-1124|I'm not a cartographer but also this using hexes helps me track time when the players say how long is it going to take
MCDM-1125|us to get from Black Bottom to or Lane I can count the number of hexes and one hacks equals one day of travel along a
MCDM-1126|road right that's the rule I use and I think I got that for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons it might be
MCDM-1127|true in I don't know probably an every edition of D&D if you're traveling along a road you go quicker than if you're
MCDM-1128|just traveling over hills and plains which are quicker than traveling through forested mountains so the rule I use is
MCDM-1129|if the players follow the road they get there one day per hex if they go over hills and plains it takes two days per
MCDM-1130|hex if they're going through forests and mountains it takes three days perhaps and obvious obviously depending on how
MCDM-1131|how much detail you prefer you can get even noodler right you can have different spans of time different for
MCDM-1132|each type of terrain you can say Oh swamps take four days and forests take three-and-a-half days or whatever that's
MCDM-1133|up to you but that sense that it's going to take the players weeks to get from point A to point B that they left the
MCDM-1134|town four or five days ago to get to the dungeon out in the middle of swamp and then they've spent three or four days
MCDM-1135|down there that accumulation of time makes it feel real helps again helps give the proceedings a sense of weight
MCDM-1136|the psychology of time is very interesting to me because something I've noticed is that players want to conserve
MCDM-1137|time when possible even though it doesn't cost them anything right if they're going along the road and they
MCDM-1138|have to travel a long distance 300 miles and it's going to take many many days to get there they will sit there and go oh
MCDM-1139|my god it's gonna take three weeks there's got to be a faster way but why if you're traveling along a safe road
MCDM-1140|the Dungeon Master is just going to say okay three weeks pass and you get there so even though it doesn't take any time
MCDM-1141|at all at the table players are always going to want to find a faster way to get there and that choice that decision
MCDM-1142|helps create drama should we go through the forest the forest is dangerous but the road goes way around will take
MCDM-1143|forever in the forest we can get through in three days so I encourage you to try it I encourage you to just try and see
MCDM-1144|as an experiment to see what it's like to actually track the amount of time it takes get a journal get a piece of paper
MCDM-1145|get a notepad or something that you stick and you're Dungeon Master's guide you pull out any time you run and just
MCDM-1146|tick off the number of days that pass I think you will find that if you go from having a purely narrative fluid game
MCDM-1147|where time is kind of up in the air and everyone kind of basically agrees it's been I don't know a couple weeks since
MCDM-1148|we left town - strictly tracking time suddenly the events become more dramatic things seem more real and that's maybe
MCDM-1149|the number one job of a dungeon master is to impress upon the players the reality of the secondary world I think
MCDM-1150|you'll also discover if you start tracking time how much time is going past that the players it might take a
MCDM-1151|month and a half or two months or three months just to get from first to third level and the characters will start
MCDM-1152|aging and that is also a fascinating process is seeing your age go up on your character sheet I played one of my
MCDM-1153|favorite characters Anthony DeVries the Paladin in my friend Brad's campaign he ran in the late 80s
MCDM-1154|and early 90s that character started off as seventeen and Brad kept strict track of time and by the time we were done by
MCDM-1155|the time my character died he was like fifteenth level I think I was like 34 or 35 and the player was still 19 years old
MCDM-1156|but that sense that my character over the course of a year and a half two years I remember how long it was about
MCDM-1157|that long had aged had gone from being a callow youth to a responsible adult leading armies was it's something that I
MCDM-1158|have often wanted to recapture for what should be obvious reasons so don't feel bad if you're not tracking time like I
MCDM-1159|said I'm not doing it right now in my campaign I'm kind of winging it I think of Matt Mercer for instance I think
MCDM-1160|basically wins it and the players there's this consensus that builds but then every once in a while time will
MCDM-1161|become important to you or the players if you haven't been tracking it strictly up until then it's gonna seem weird when
MCDM-1162|you start doing it all of a sudden because that's when people will start disagreeing regarding how much time has
MCDM-1163|gone by so give it a shot try tracking time and in order to track time here's part two of the video in order to track
MCDM-1164|time well you're gonna need a calendar and I think building a calendar is one of the most fascinating aspects of being
MCDM-1165|a dungeon master something if you haven't done I strongly encourage you to give it a shot because so much of our
MCDM-1166|culture is expressed and defined by our calendar that once you start looking into why are the months called what they
MCDM-1167|are why are the days of the week called what they are why are there how many days there are in a year you discover a
MCDM-1168|lot about our world both the physical reality of the world and the cultural reality of the world and then when you
MCDM-1169|start answering those same questions in your world you learn a lot about your world for instance our months are named
MCDM-1170|after a combination of the ninth month the tenth month the 11th month and also famous rulers
MCDM-1171|August and July right if you go back and figure out why is obvious called August you discover wasn't always called August
MCDM-1172|until there was a guy Caesar Augustus who was a Roman Emperor and they part of deifying him was naming a month after
MCDM-1173|him and Julius II Oh Emperor Julius Caesar got the same treatment so that's how we get July and August and that is
MCDM-1174|fascinating and notice we have July and August we also have September and October we have two completely different
MCDM-1175|standards for naming months and that's because human beings are not consistent they're messy the calendar changes in
MCDM-1176|unpredictable ways and studying how the calendar in the real world has changed it creates these layers in the real
MCDM-1177|world of time passing like for a long time the calendar the months were called this and then we change them at a
MCDM-1178|certain point and if you do the same thing in your world you will discover that you are inventing this history for
MCDM-1179|your world why are the months named what they were and how did that change and why and now you've created depth and
MCDM-1180|layers for your world and that is one of the fun parts of being Dungeon Master the players may never know anything
MCDM-1181|about this but you having the answers behind the screen will again you know how the sense is going to end right will
MCDM-1182|make it seem more real of course you can do what Tolkien did you can just say listen my characters don't speak English
MCDM-1183|they speak you know common the common tongue in that planet but we as players speak English so that was a conceit that
MCDM-1184|Tolkien enjoyed deploying was the idea that Frodo and Aragorn are not speaking to each other in English but what they
MCDM-1185|they're speaking to each other in you know a Western I guess or whatever it was and Tolkien was translating it into
MCDM-1186|English so obviously since they're not speaking English they aren't referring to the English days of the week or the
MCDM-1187|English months so Tolkien translated those so in the Lord of the Rings he talks about events happening in August
MCDM-1188|or in July or on a Monday or on a Friday right and you understand well they don't have the same calendar we have a Tolkien
MCDM-1189|has translated for us of course you can do the same thing you can say listen I don't want to spend hours or days coming
MCDM-1190|up with a calendar that's plausible I'm just going to use but I do want to keep strict time records I do want to try
MCDM-1191|that so just use the real world calendar and that has the advantage of your players understand it when you say oh
MCDM-1192|the shipment is going to arrive at the docks that the smugglers are going to drop off the ship and on a Friday right
MCDM-1193|next Friday the players understand what that means and they can ask what day is it right
MCDM-1194|now you can say oh it's Tuesday and a players understand what that means so that's kind of the tier 1 solution right
MCDM-1195|tier 0 is don't track time right which is what a lot of us are doing right now but tier 1 is track time but just use a
MCDM-1196|regular mundane calendar again that has the advantage of being known and comprehensible to your players but then
MCDM-1197|if you decide to invent your own calendar it has the disadvantage of your players don't know what that calendar
MCDM-1198|means and every time you mention a day of the week or a month they're gonna have to go to some handout you've given
MCDM-1199|them and translate and figure out what day is that how many days away is that how many
MCDM-1200|months away is that from now but it does have the advantage of seeming real of making your worlds seem like it has more
MCDM-1201|depth and also conveying certain ideas about how your cultures think of and reference time for instance there are 12
MCDM-1202|typically 12 or 13 months in the typical earth year because that is linked to the cycle of the moon well how many moons
MCDM-1203|does your world have doesn't even have moons you know does it have a moon like ours or does it have more than one moon
MCDM-1204|and one of the phases of those moons suddenly now you're getting to some really interesting questions about the
MCDM-1205|cosmology of your world not just the cultures but the physical reality of it our world has 365 days does yours why
MCDM-1206|why don't have 360 Wow the Babylonians would have been a lot happier if the earth took 3 exactly 360 days to go
MCDM-1207|around the Sun but of course we don't have 360 days it's messy it's 365 and a bit and technically I think that number
MCDM-1208|changes over the course of centuries or millennia so now you've got a grapple with how often how long does it take for
MCDM-1209|your world to go around its Sun and what do you do with those little rounding errors you know a lot of old calendars
MCDM-1210|had this idea that there were some days that don't belong to any month they would have like feasting days or
MCDM-1211|holidays that would just exist between two months and just floated there I had their own name and that was completely
MCDM-1212|unambiguous everyone knew that if you were talking about midwinter for instance that was this day that took
MCDM-1213|place between these two months and didn't belong to any month what year is it in your world we track time obviously
MCDM-1214|from the birth of Christ right which we've now kind of historians trying to remove a certain kind of bias from
MCDM-1215|calendars now call the Common Era and before the Common Era but of course that's completely
MCDM-1216|arbitrary every civilizations calendar has to pick some arbitrary point to start from and what point they pick is
MCDM-1217|fascinating because that tells you what's important to them right what year you start counting from tells your
MCDM-1218|players that something important happened that many years ago and that import that thing was important to these
MCDM-1219|people in this world this culture when you pick a year for your campaign to happen and let's pick a random here
MCDM-1220|let's say that your campaign takes place in the year 378 you just told your players something important happened 378
MCDM-1221|years ago it specifically something important to these people in the culture the campaign is taking place in what was
MCDM-1222|it what happened 378 years ago I have no idea but I really want to know don't you a lot of dictators in the real world
MCDM-1223|have decided have renamed the calendar and started that Year Zero to say this is the year of the revolution and work
MCDM-1224|hours start we're throwing out all the old stuff and starting new a lot of civilizations didn't keep a constant
MCDM-1225|record of years they would reset every time there was a new king or a new emperor and there was okay this is the
MCDM-1226|16th year of this king or Emperor's reign and you just knew everyone who grew up in that era knew that this king
MCDM-1227|ruled after this king who ruled after this king it was just in the common memory so when you referred to the 17th
MCDM-1228|year of this Kings reign everyone knew how long ago that was even though we now looking back on a calendar like that
MCDM-1229|would have to do a bunch of math but the people who lived back then didn't have to do that kind of math they just knew
MCDM-1230|why are there seven days in a week that's a good question when you start asking these questions you start
MCDM-1231|discovering that some of these things are completely arbitrary right you could certainly have you know ten days in a
MCDM-1232|week if you wanted to depending on how your months work and how many divisions of a month you want to have but then
MCDM-1233|other measurements are not entirely arbitrary like a year is a real the earth really does go around the Sun and
MCDM-1234|tracking one revolution around the Sun is not arbitrary but it's certainly not a physical constant it's always
MCDM-1235|fascinating to go online and research other calendars and see how other civilizations in the real world tried to
MCDM-1236|track time for instance I remember the French after the during the Revolution the French kind of went a little insane
MCDM-1237|with like the metric system and rationality and we're gonna have a perfectly rational world and they tried
MCDM-1238|to have a metric calendar for a little while I don't think it really worked out and but they I love this one idea where
MCDM-1239|they decided to name every day of the year with like a unique name right so like August 17th might be called lamp I
MCDM-1240|just picked a random and they and actually they ran out of good dramatic words pretty quickly it had to come up
MCDM-1241|with all sorts of crazy like like June 18th is bread or whatever but the result of that was somebody could say well when
MCDM-1242|were you born and you might say I was born in bread in 1970 and they would know that bread was this one specific
MCDM-1243|day that's actually a pretty cool idea so what are the names of the days of the week how many weeks are there in your
MCDM-1244|month why are there 12 months are the 13 months are there 360 days or the 365 days how long does it take your world to
MCDM-1245|go around the Sun how many moons does it have these are all fascinating questions and as you go to the process of
MCDM-1246|answering them you learn a lot about your world I have my calendar I put my calendar in the doobly-doo that I use
MCDM-1247|for my game and I put a lot of work into it and what I did for this campaign was I went into our world and looked at our
MCDM-1248|months and other calendars in medieval Europe that are not the typical like Roman calendar and what they named
MCDM-1249|months of the year and then came up with my own kind of versions of those so if you know what the words of my calendar
MCDM-1250|mean you know why that month was named that but that's just one way to do it you could very easily just make up names
MCDM-1251|right I think that's one of the two basic divisions of how to do a fantasy world is you just make stuff up and I
MCDM-1252|think a lot of like the Forgotten Realms just sounds like they made up a bunch of words and many of which don't sound to
MCDM-1253|me like they could be plausible words and that's one of the criticisms I have against the Forgotten Realms but it's
MCDM-1254|still a setting that I have played a lot in and then also there's the I'm gonna try and replicate the real world and try
MCDM-1255|to figure out why were things in a real world called what they were and then come up with my own versions of those
MCDM-1256|neither of those is better than the other there are virtues to both of them
MCDM-1257|certainly the virtue of the Forgotten Realms was it's easy just make up 13 cool sounding names and those are your
MCDM-1258|months I think you'll find if you make your own calendar not only is it kind of fun also you get the opportunity to then
MCDM-1259|hand it out to your players and once you've done that some of your players will be like ooh
MCDM-1260|they will think it's neat they will enjoy using your hand out their own personal version of your calendar to
MCDM-1261|track when they left the city when they arrived in town how long they spent in the dungeon their copy of your calendar
MCDM-1262|will become their own idiosyncratic Journal of your game that is also fun it's fun for them as
MCDM-1263|players it's also neat for you as the dungeon master if you're like me and you're running Dungeons & Dragons and
MCDM-1264|you're not keeping track of time I encourage you to give it a shot give it some thought
MCDM-1265|and I think you will find that it does lend the proceedings more weight I'll put a link in the doobly-doo to a great
MCDM-1266|tool you can use to build your own fantasy calendar you tell it how many days of the week there are in your world
MCDM-1267|and what the names of the days are did Oh months and it will build a calendar for you I did mine in Excel and I did it
MCDM-1268|because I wanted to have certain days a certain number of days that didn't belong to any month although I liked the
MCDM-1269|idea that hundreds of years in the future of my campaign eventually this period will be called a month called
MCDM-1270|like midwinter or something like that and you get this sense at least I like having this sense of the language
MCDM-1271|changing over time that's something that is a hallmark of my campaign and if you have player decides to actually try to
MCDM-1272|figure out why things are called what they're called they learn things about the world I like tracking for instance
MCDM-1273|when the spring and autumnal equinox are equinox is a latin word meaning equal night they're the two days a year where
MCDM-1274|there's as much exactly as much daylight as there is nighttime and now we're starting to get into celestial mechanics
MCDM-1275|and we start thinking about things like what is the sky in your world look like not only how many moons are there but
MCDM-1276|what are the constellations and I love stuff like that you could even say that there are a number of constellations
MCDM-1277|equal to the number of months in your world and they're named after the constellations that notion of what do
MCDM-1278|people see when they look up in the sky to me is a fascinating question and the answers are culturally revealing that's
MCDM-1279|the second video on time folks consider making a calendar no pressure obviously it can't be that important
MCDM-1280|because I don't do it I don't think Matt Mercer does it but I know I have done in the past and the campaign's where I have
MCDM-1281|kept track of time I do feel as though the the campaign was more meaningful the characters progression and
MCDM-1282|accomplishments were more meaningful and so I encourage you to give a shot lots of stuff has happened since the last
MCDM-1283|video unfortunately it's all happening behind the scenes like I said I'm about three-quarters of the way through the
MCDM-1284|secret project and then when that's done we're going to move on to me working on finishing the stronghold rules the rules
MCDM-1285|and charts and all that are all done I just have to write up what everything means and then I'm also building like I
MCDM-1286|said a multi-camera studio because I want to stream D&D again except I want to look good
MCDM-1287|and be easy and fun and maybe have some innovations regarding how we deal with stuff like twitch chat and that takes
MCDM-1288|time I spend about one day a week now with my friend Jerry my producer working on the setup for the studio and testing
MCDM-1289|new technology people send me stuff I got this fantastic campaign guide in the mail from somebody older than me who's
MCDM-1290|been running D&D since before I started running and who had gotten burned out on it because of that we get together on
MCDM-1291|game night and we play D&D because that's what we do on Thursday nights and he saw my West marches video and was
MCDM-1292|blown away it's funny because I had a couple people say I watch the whole video I still don't know what a West
MCDM-1293|marches campaign is I think they're expecting a more complex answer than the real answer which is it's just a
MCDM-1294|campaign that is run basically by the players there is no specific game night it's up to the players to decide where
MCDM-1295|they're going to go and what they're going to do and who they're going to play with they self organize and then
MCDM-1296|tell you we want to play this Tuesday night me and Bob and Carol and Doug and then you say okay I will have the
MCDM-1297|adventure ready that Tuesday so it's you reacting to the players rather than the other way around and that style of play
MCDM-1298|caused this game master to completely revolutionize this game and have a lot of fun he sent me his campaign setting
MCDM-1299|which I read big chunks of I thought was fantastic reminds me to reading this run minded me to a certain extent of reading
MCDM-1300|the arguing grimoire when I was a kid which if you don't know what that is well maybe we'll do a series of videos
MCDM-1301|on the arguing grimoire I also got a whole bunch of these in the mail like 50 of these coupons for M&Ms because one of
MCDM-1302|my viewers works at Mars mmm and said hey I just wanted to say thank you and sent me a whole bunch of coupons so we
MCDM-1303|have a whole bunch of like M&Ms and Twix game night now because of that thank you very much I also got this in the mail I
MCDM-1304|don't know exactly what it is or who sent it or why but you know I don't pretty sure I didn't kickstart this so
MCDM-1305|this is something that when I have more time I will check out it's like book on game mastery it's got a bunch of a got a
MCDM-1306|couple of dungeons it's got traps and puzzles in it people ask me about puzzles all the time and that's
MCDM-1307|something that don't have any advice on anytime I've ever needed a puzzle I kind of just made one up on the spot and it
MCDM-1308|either worked or didn't work I used to use grim truth grim tooths traps but those are kind of real old-school
MCDM-1309|funhouse dungeon traps I'm not sure I could recommend them to a modern Dungeon Master and I
MCDM-1310|also remember the book of challenges from 3rd edition DD if you're looking for trap like encounters the book of
MCDM-1311|challenges has some pretty cool ones in it but when I need a puzzle I do the same thing you do I go online I look for
MCDM-1312|stuff I try things out I made up a chessboard puzzle once that was really cool and really effective I just again I
MCDM-1313|I I don't think I really know anything about making puzzles I've always thought that puzzles belong in D&D they give you
MCDM-1314|that sense of a earlier fantastic powerful world with mages that could bend reality and create these puzzle
MCDM-1315|trap things that's a neat part of the history of D&D but certainly you can run an entire game without any puzzles it's
MCDM-1316|my hope that the next video will be the prepping an adventure and you get to watch me go through the process of
MCDM-1317|prepping against the cult of the reptile God because I think it's a great adventure and I think watching me how I
MCDM-1318|prep an adventure is going to be somewhat enlightening I get the the spoiler is that it's you're going to
MCDM-1319|learn that less is more and that for me the process of prepping an adventure is largely just just trying to decipher
MCDM-1320|what's in the adventure and what do I actually have to read and pay attention to because a lot of the information in
MCDM-1321|adventure I think is is nonsense you can skip the folks who write adventures I think have a lot in common with other
MCDM-1322|kinds of writers in that they make the mistake of thinking that the reader has to understand everything I know about
MCDM-1323|this adventure in order to appreciate my brilliance and so they front-load the adventure with all this history that the
MCDM-1324|new player thinks they have to read and understand but usually that history is pretty meaningless and doesn't actually
MCDM-1325|come up in the adventure as written and you can skip it and that's something I have learned over decades of running the
MCDM-1326|game may not be obvious to a new player so watching me prep an adventure is I think largely going to be figuring out
MCDM-1327|what stuff I throw out at ignore and what stuff I actually pay attention to that's your tiny microscopic preview of
MCDM-1328|the next video as usual I don't have a patreon there are no ads in front of my D&D videos although I did have somebody
MCDM-1329|on reddit say Matt you should you should turn on ads for your videos and I was like oh no I don't think I'm gonna do
MCDM-1330|that because ads I think are really annoying mostly because the ads they put in front of videos are not ads for
MCDM-1331|things you are going to want to click on or buy if I had if I had some belief that the ads
MCDM-1332|that would be turned on were ads for things that you wanted I would be a lot more comfortable turning to mom because
MCDM-1333|that's what I want I want ads that are actually for things I buy I'm like the I'm a you know a deeply American
MCDM-1334|consumer when it comes to like spending money I spend lots of money on lots of frivolous stuff like all this stuff for
MCDM-1335|making videos for instance and I would love it if the ads I saw were tailored for the stuff I buy but of course
MCDM-1336|they're not and so it'll turning on ads is just an annoyance and they don't make that much money you tube tells you how
MCDM-1337|much money you would be making from ads if you turn them on and the answer is not much I make way more selling books
MCDM-1338|and the books or things I own and make and people fall in love with them and want more and that makes me want to make
MCDM-1339|more videos and write more books so it's a great ecology and I have no plans to really ever turn on ads if I can at all
MCDM-1340|avoid it I think I can as long as you folks buy books so come by my Amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo
MCDM-1341|I've written two fantasy novels I haven't done really any work on the third one for a while because I've got
MCDM-1342|the I've got dungeon here's the list of stuff first of all I have a job I have a full-time job work at Turtle Rock
MCDM-1343|Studios and we're doing lots of cool stuff that I'm proud of and can't wait to share with you folks a lot you know
MCDM-1344|really I think interesting and innovative game spaces that were exploring and then after that I run
MCDM-1345|Dungeons & Dragons every week and that takes you know not only one of my evenings but typically about half my
MCDM-1346|weekend to prep for and then I would like to make more D&D videos and that usually takes a day to record and edit
MCDM-1347|and then I'm working on the top-secret project which is a lot of fun and I'm enjoying it's some of the most vital
MCDM-1348|work I've done recently I can't wait to share it with you but again that takes a lot of time and then on top of that I'm
MCDM-1349|going to do stronghold rules and I'm building a D&D studio and our streaming studio and all sorts of nonsense so
MCDM-1350|unfortunately not a lot of time has been spent on the third novel but the first two novels I think are a lot of fun and
MCDM-1351|if you like Dungeons & Dragons on this channel I think you would probably like them check them out that's it folks
MCDM-1352|thanks for being patient it's probably going to be another couple of weeks before you get a video but by that time
MCDM-1353|I should be done with the secret project moving on to the stronghold rules which everybody wants and we're gonna have the
MCDM-1354|Battle of castle rend next week in my campaign those of you who were following the campaign Diaries it's my hope that
MCDM-1355|we will at some point get caught up maybe with a big livestream where I got all the players
MCDM-1356|the other we talk about everything this happened since last campaign Diary I know that's not exactly what people want
MCDM-1357|but it would be fun and it's something that I can actually get done right we can spend two hours talking about what
MCDM-1358|happened in the game since last we left our heroes and it will culminate with two armies showing up at Nicodemus
MCDM-1359|castle lord Saxton's army and then ladies Ariel's army of the undead and the hero's attempts to fight them
MCDM-1360|off and that will be using my warfare system which is the sequel to my stronghold system both of these are
MCDM-1361|systems I've been using for quite a while they just need to be adapted for fifth edition and I'm super looking
MCDM-1362|forward to that come by my twitter feed there's link in the doobly-doo if you want to see photographs of the game
MCDM-1363|every Thursday when we play we take pictures and upload them my friend Anna who plays a hundred in Modesto the bar
MCDM-1364|the Rioja and bard she often live tweets the game as we play it it's all it's a blast her gift game is strong so I know
MCDM-1365|there have been a lot of videos but there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and I think become you know
MCDM-1366|like was April May June somewhere late May early June there'll be a flood of new content and you'd be like holy crap
MCDM-1367|I'm getting sick of Matt Koval how do you think I feel I have to live with the guy until next time folks have a good
MCDM-1368|time peace out  
MCDM-1369|there was a moment early in my current D&D campaign where one of the players was behaving in a manner contrary to the
MCDM-1370|well-being of the party nails the team's sorcerer played by my friend tom was suddenly exhibiting
MCDM-1371|godlike powers and has his power grew his humanity evaporated at one point nails grew impatient with an NPC the
MCDM-1372|wizard butts and the NPC exploded no spell was cast there was no rule in the players handbook that granted a sorcerer
MCDM-1373|of this power he just did it one of the other players Anna wanted Tom to just explain what was happening with his
MCDM-1374|character when Tom offered no explanation and I got frustrated she was slowly realizing that tom was not on
MCDM-1375|their side she even said this sucks what is going on she was frustrated but she was slowly realizing along with the rest
MCDM-1376|of the party that part of their current adventure one of the challenges they had to solve was what to do about nails I
MCDM-1377|think maybe the biggest problem through all this was the fact that the players many of whom were new had a hard time
MCDM-1378|contextualizing their reactions in character having been through all this once I don't think they'd had that same
MCDM-1379|problem again it's one of the more dramatic things that's happened in the campaign it was crazy it was cool it was
MCDM-1380|fun it was memorable the players had to figure out how do we stop nails and they had a few different tools they could use
MCDM-1381|good ideas and it played out in a way that was close to what I expected what with some interesting twists I was able
MCDM-1382|to do this highly narrative dramatic plotline because I collaborated with Tom Tom originally had an entirely different
MCDM-1383|character of mind boots but I said hey go watch the original series Star Trek episode where no man has gone before and
MCDM-1384|tell me what you think he watched it that day and reported back that it was cool and I said how about we do that Tom
MCDM-1385|hadn't really played D&D before and so he was excited at the possibility that the hobby could contain such nonsense he
MCDM-1386|didn't know in other words how weird and non-standard this is I explained it would mean
MCDM-1387|creating an entire fake character I was collaborating with Tom apart from the other players I was sort of bringing him
MCDM-1388|behind diem screen with me on purpose to create a dramatic moment that probably couldn't
MCDM-1389|have happened any other way everybody Matt Koval here you know we've covered a lot of ground in the running
MCDM-1390|the game series and I'm always thinking about what kind of advice to give new DMS but I think this counts very much as
MCDM-1391|next-level DM techniques not something you want to try your first time running because it relies on you relying on
MCDM-1392|another player to play their part if I just gave this power to Tom with no price no explanation and no discussion
MCDM-1393|outside the game the players including Tom would spend their time trying to figure out how to tame this power how to
MCDM-1394|keep it but that's not drama that's min maxing Phoenix is way more powerful than Marvel girl she's so
MCDM-1395|powerful she renders the rest of the x-men obsolete and that's okay because the author knows dark Phoenix is coming
MCDM-1396|and dark Phoenix is a problem to solve that was the core of my discussion with Tom I told him no matter what nails his
MCDM-1397|power could not be controlled you know maybe he could be cured that's reasonable but that kind of solution
MCDM-1398|requires time and resources it means research and that was not on the table many people watching were
MCDM-1399|disappointed the whole thing resolved itself in only a couple of episodes they wanted the problem to grow over weeks
MCDM-1400|and months but as soon as the players feel like they're in control of the situation if they felt like they could
MCDM-1401|ignore the problem with nails until they got back to civilization if they felt like they had the time to do research
MCDM-1402|and experiment then the drama dies drama requires tension and in this scenario the tension is the ticking clock nails
MCDM-1403|as power grows his humanity fades if you had more time if you were in capital and you could see a powerful wizard well you
MCDM-1404|might be able to cure him but you do not have time you do not have resources you're going to have to do something
MCDM-1405|desperate that is drama pushing the players past their comfort zone or the only choices they have to make is which
MCDM-1406|goblin to attack and really forcing them to think outside the box this isn't that different from just playing out a
MCDM-1407|character's backstory lots of players enjoy making characters with a dark secrets that will play out over the
MCDM-1408|course of the campaign which only the DM and the player know about it's a big part of what makes the
MCDM-1409|secondary world feel like a real place each of the players has the potential to know something about the world that the
MCDM-1410|other players don't just like the real world as Tom played nails is growing power and loss of humanity I was able to
MCDM-1411|sort of sit back and watch this was amazing to me as tom was a completely new player and I realized that what
MCDM-1412|we're doing when we collaborate with a player to create some dramatic moment or arc is we're promoting the player to the
MCDM-1413|sort of quasi DM role Tom playing Omega nails has to react to the other players exactly the same way I would if I were
MCDM-1414|playing an NPC and this gets to the collaborative element of all role playing there is always in every RPG
MCDM-1415|session that element of playing along even if the players don't know it there is an unspoken or maybe spoken agreement
MCDM-1416|that the players will play along with whatever adventure the DM has ready within reason in a sense the players are
MCDM-1417|already sort of acting as little mini DMS they are not always only ever interested in what would my character do
MCDM-1418|they are also interested even if they aren't thinking about it in party cohesion and drama and keeping the flow
MCDM-1419|of the adventure moving it may seem radical or dangerous to bring a player more toward the DM side of the game
MCDM-1420|asking them to collaborate with you to create drama but it should not seem radical it is perfectly ordinary for a
MCDM-1421|player to include hooks in their backstory the DM can use to create drama what happens when the assassin who
MCDM-1422|killed their parents shows up in that scenario the player definitely knows things about
MCDM-1423|this new mysterious assassin that the other players don't know which they may not reveal in these strict service of
MCDM-1424|problem-solving and overcoming the challenge they may choose to reveal what they know about this enemy assassin when
MCDM-1425|it best serves the narrative so I say it's a very small leap from that which is normal to the player shifting even
MCDM-1426|farther over to the DM side and collaborating to create a dramatic beat you the DM take the player aside and
MCDM-1427|pitch them on this dramatic arc your pitch is not just an idea hey it would be neat if we collaborated together to
MCDM-1428|create some cool drama it needs a structure when we launch to the chain I wanted to start with a bang
MCDM-1429|so I busted out the same hook I used when I ran this campaign at pandemic studios for the mercenaries design team
MCDM-1430|I took two of the players aside in this case Lars and Phil the two players I thought
MCDM-1431|would naturally gravitate toward the commander role and I just asked them hey which of you is gonna be the commander
MCDM-1432|they talked about it and they agreed on Phil so I said okay Lars here's my pitch you're going to make a fake character
MCDM-1433|the commander and Phil is going to be the lieutenant then in the first episode you are fake character is killed and
MCDM-1434|Phil's lieutenant becomes commander they loved that idea the other players had no idea any of this was happening this was
MCDM-1435|an easy plot to play out because it was all going to happen in the first combat I didn't really need Lars or Phil to do
MCDM-1436|anything except play their characters I told him let me worry about how Lars is fake character dies so they didn't have
MCDM-1437|anything to do except play D&D normally they didn't know about realm they didn't know ajax was going to show up all of
MCDM-1438|their reactions to that were perfectly authentic the setup with nails was much more complex I was lucky because Tom
MCDM-1439|very much wanted to serve the drama he wasn't interested in gaming the system he was able to take the guidelines I set
MCDM-1440|out and be creative within those boundaries we talked a lot about what nails could do I gave him certain beats
MCDM-1441|to hit like detonating a junior officer and we would talk about it and then during the session I'd message him to
MCDM-1442|let him know now is the time we talked about how his power was going to grow in stages and what the limits of his power
MCDM-1443|were at each stage stage one you can cast your spell's without using spell slots pretty straightforward didn't
MCDM-1444|require a lot of role-playing from Tom by the time he got to stage three his power was basically limitless so we had
MCDM-1445|this plan certain moments how his power would grow and what he would do with it but when confronted by the other players
MCDM-1446|that was all Tom it was up to him to play the part he improvised stuff like being able to command the somnium to
MCDM-1447|neveress with his mind he invented the idea that he could just know where everything and everyone on the ship was
MCDM-1448|meanwhile I invented the idea that like dr. Manhattan nails could be in two places at once
MCDM-1449|I didn't tell Tom I was going to do that he was as surprised as everyone else when angel reported it and said they had
MCDM-1450|won the battle against the duo are below decks because nails was down their fire balling everyone but nails was here some
MCDM-1451|of the players said those moments where tom is hearing about some crazy stuff his character did and didn't
MCDM-1452|know about it are so unique to D&D in that moment tom was still a player still reacting to my nonsense but instead of
MCDM-1453|reacting in a manner designed to resolve drama which is what the players are normally trying to do he was reacting in
MCDM-1454|a manner designed to increase it now your first reaction may be that takes putting a lot of trust in your players
MCDM-1455|yes that's that's the point first of all it might not work just because a player thinks it's a cool idea it doesn't mean
MCDM-1456|it will go off without a hitch but this is D&D it's not open-heart surgery there aren't lives on the line if an idea
MCDM-1457|excites you and you share it with a player and they're excited that's reason enough to try it and if it doesn't work
MCDM-1458|running one of a million reasons that doesn't mean it was a bad idea it might work next time I've never had a
MCDM-1459|player not want to collaborate with me to create a moment they are always excited and eager to try it my friend
MCDM-1460|Steve Howard ran a DC heroes game in which I played a speedster a flash type character named mister in between it was
MCDM-1461|set in Long Beach and the players were each going to invent a member of a now-defunct superhero team the team
MCDM-1462|broke up years ago after the group's leader was murdered under mysterious circumstances
MCDM-1463|he asked each of us to tell him privately why our character was responsible for killing the group's
MCDM-1464|leader he would then pick which of our stories was the real reason it was a great setup because it meant we each had
MCDM-1465|to invent a character with a reason to kill our old leader but only one of us or maybe none of us actually did it very
MCDM-1466|Agatha Christie I emailed Steven said I killed our old leader because my character is actually a robotic
MCDM-1467|duplicate of the original mister in between I was created by one of our old arch-nemesis placed on the team secretly
MCDM-1468|and no one knows what happened to the original mister in between i bided my time until our leader was weak and alone
MCDM-1469|and I killed him Steve loved that idea but he said no no you didn't kill him you were nowhere near the place you are
MCDM-1470|a robotic duplicate of the original mister in between and you were put on the team to kill the team's leader but
MCDM-1471|someone else beat you to the punch and your programming didn't account for this so you've spent the last three years
MCDM-1472|continuing to be mister in between you're in this limbo where the trigger you were created to
MCDM-1473|pull cannot now ever be pulled infinite loop we played for a couple of months some external threat possibly related to
MCDM-1474|the death of our old leader has got the team back together we don't exactly trust each other but we all want to know
MCDM-1475|the truth about what happened years ago I enjoy dropping these little hints into the game that my character wasn't human
MCDM-1476|I'd suggest logical but absurd solutions to some problems and then as the team got closer to the truth the real mr.
MCDM-1477|in-between showed up he changed his identity become another hero whom we'd met and dealt with and in a critical
MCDM-1478|moment he pulled off his mask revealing my face confronting the heroes about who he was and who I was this was an
MCDM-1479|incredibly memorable moment my friends I still talk about it 20 years later as I tried to convince them I was me and the
MCDM-1480|GM tried to convince them he was me like the problem with nails the players didn't know what to do they were sort of
MCDM-1481|lost at sea they could no longer rely on their character sheets to solve the problem they had to think and make a
MCDM-1482|decision on imperfect datum that is drama Steve and I had talked about this this robot I was playing was actually a
MCDM-1483|villain and therefore has enormous power enough power to take on the entire group he's pretending to be this other
MCDM-1484|character and so is balanced with their power level but if the ruse is ever discovered he would drop the act and use
MCDM-1485|all his power he could kill the entire team role playing in character all of us arguing about who the real mister in
MCDM-1486|between was was memorable but not as memorable as what happened when combat broke out and my character revealed
MCDM-1487|himself to be a robot in disguise when initiative was called the players thought they were going to watch me and
MCDM-1488|this doppelganger fight but in the middle of the combat I turned on the heroes and Steve and I traded character
MCDM-1489|sheets he gave me the PC version of my hero and I gave him the robotic villain version of my hero and I took over the
MCDM-1490|role-playing smoothly transitioning into making the same arguments and using the same dialogue Steve had been doing
MCDM-1491|because I was now playing that character how badass is this role-playing games everyone it's the most fun you could
MCDM-1492|have with your brain if you can get your players on your side collaborating with you to create drama then you can do
MCDM-1493|almost anything I'm not going to this always plays out without a hitch sometimes it does but you can't count on
MCDM-1494|that what plans of ours do go off without a hitch to me the surprises the things I
MCDM-1495|never thought of like sweet sacrificing himself to stop nails because Phil really really wanted to play a gift
MCDM-1496|Yankee is what makes the game fun but collaborating with a player to create a dramatic moment with a satisfying
MCDM-1497|conclusion does take more work than normal DMing because there are more moving parts this is why I think this is
MCDM-1498|advanced deeming one of the reasons I wanted to open the chain of Akron campaign with some player collaboration
MCDM-1499|I wanted to show people the game can be a lot more than just the DM describes the challenge the players try to solve
MCDM-1500|it we have the freedom to blur those lines in really interesting ways but it requires some experience guiding
MCDM-1501|characters and working with your players I've never really done this with more than one or two players at a time I
MCDM-1502|think it's important that you limit the number of variables the number of things that can go wrong to one or maybe two of
MCDM-1503|your players plus doing it with all of your players would be weird who in that scenario is reacting authentically
MCDM-1504|although now that I think of it I am reminded of one classic paranoia adventure and it's rare that I do this
MCDM-1505|more than once in a campaign although the chain of Akron is an exception I think the fear for some people is that
MCDM-1506|once you've had a moment like this how will the players know any given scenario isn't a setup with a player collaborated
MCDM-1507|to create drama no they don't but this I think is more problem for the audience watching a stream than the actual
MCDM-1508|players since the god factor scenario with nails none of the players have ever questioned is this another one of those
MCDM-1509|scenarios there was a point at lunch with the whole group where I just explained flat-out tom is collaborating
MCDM-1510|with me for this the challenge is how are the rest of you going to solve the problem of nails I have no problem just
MCDM-1511|explicitly stating the nature of a challenge in a very meta how would the characters know that sense because the
MCDM-1512|players are not their characters and sometimes pulling the curtain back removes frustration while preserving
MCDM-1513|drama I can't tell you step by step how to do this because the solution is going to be totally unique to your scenario
MCDM-1514|but I've given you three examples me and nails me and the commander of the chain and Steve and I in his superhero game
MCDM-1515|like a lot of my advice just being aware this as possible is most of what you need but remember that you and your
MCDM-1516|candidate player can sit down talk about what you want to happen explore ideas and then key certain moments to triggers
MCDM-1517|I'll text you when it's time for you to reveal yourself oh I've also given you a fourth example
MCDM-1518|if you remember the DM keeping control of the triggers it was up to Steve to decide when the real mr. McQueen was
MCDM-1519|going to confront us means you're still in control of the pacing of the adventure and that's important don't try
MCDM-1520|this on your first time out it's super common to want to do everything cool all in one go but as you get to know your
MCDM-1521|players and their characters you'll come up with some cool ideas and you'll know which of your players is the best
MCDM-1522|candidate it might not work but if it does i 100% guarantee you it will become one of the most talked-about
MCDM-1523|and remembered parts of your game thanks for watching everybody that is the player collaboration video just one of
MCDM-1524|the tricks I use to create drama and make the game memorable we've taken a break from the chain of Akron we've been
MCDM-1525|playing in my friend Phil's game and streaming it live on Wednesday nights for the past of three weeks but next
MCDM-1526|week the Wednesday after this video goes up we will be back to me being behind the screen and we will continue with the
MCDM-1527|exploration of ring well if you like this video and you want to support this channel we do have a patreon you can
MCDM-1528|come by I post my notes for my D&D campaign before we run on Wednesday nights we've also got a store where you
MCDM-1529|can pick up a new t-shirt designed by Tom schmuck and of course strongholds and followers
MCDM-1530|available in print and PDF we are getting ready for the next Kickstarter if you want an alert when the kingdoms
MCDM-1531|in warfare Kickstarter goes live there is a link in the doobly-doo if you're looking for advice on running the game
MCDM-1532|we have a great an active discord there are links to all our social stuff in the doobly-doo until next time peace out
MCDM-1533|Hey, everybody, I had  a great idea for starting this episode about the D.M. Screen by having me sitting behind the D.M. Screen.
MCDM-1534|but unfortunately, my mic is right here, and when I put the D.M. Screen up like this, all the sudden I sound like I'm at the bottom of a well. so that is not the most...Wait, I have an idea, hang on one second.
MCDM-1535|Hey! There we go! Fantastic. Okay, so how was I going to...oh When last we left our heroes...See that's how you can tell D&D has started,
MCDM-1536|we're not talking about movies or work anymore. I am sitting behind the D.M.'s Screen, and I say "When last we left our heroes." Okay, we can get rid of this.
MCDM-1537|This week we're going to talk about the Dungeon Master's Screen. About why some people use one and why some people don't. We'll talk about some of the history of it and
MCDM-1538|some options as a D.M. when it comes to choosing your D.M. Screen. Yes, there is more than one choice. So, you saw how I begin my D&D game.
MCDM-1539|I say, "When last we left our heroes." And the players know, "Oh hey, it's time to play." It's a tradition of mine, and the players like it.
MCDM-1540|I used to, then, recap what happened the week before, but I don't do that anymore. Because one of the things that I noticed was that when the D.M. tells the players, "Here's what happened last week."
MCDM-1541|Suddenly, they're getting a view of what happened the week before from my point of view. And because I sit behind the D.M. Screen, and because of my authority as a Dungeon Master, my description of what happened the week before
MCDM-1542|sounds more authoritative, it sounds more real, than how they remember it. And, even though you may not realize it, there is almost always a difference between how you remember things and how your players remember things.
MCDM-1543|That's something you are going to learn pretty quickly once you start running the game. Every session of D&D is kind of like Rashomon. Each player, including you, remembers things differently.
MCDM-1544|And when you jump in, and you start describing how you remember things suddenly they feel like that's the real way it happened, and when it disagrees with what they think happened, now you've got a problem.
MCDM-1545|So, one of the things I've noticed is that asking my players, "Okay, who wants to sum up what happened last week?" Acts as a terrific diagnostic tool,
MCDM-1546|it helps me understand "what do you guys think happened last week?" And it's useful because often, it turns out, they don't realize what kind of a jam they're in, or, alternatively, they think that this is going to be a horrible fight coming up
MCDM-1547|but in fact it's not, or maybe think this N.P.C.'s angry at them when I didn't think that, or maybe they think they solved a problem when I didn't think they did. And rather than contradict them,
MCDM-1548|it gives me the opportunity to kind of change things behind the scenes to accommodate them. Because, I don't feel comfortable contradicting them and saying "no, no, that's not what happened, let me tell you what happened."
MCDM-1549|I mean, sometimes at critical points, obviously that's necessary. But, generally, I like to err on the side of the players. So I try to keep my mouth shut, and I try to actually encourage my players to tell me what they think happened
MCDM-1550|because then I get their point of view, and that helps me decide what really happened last week. There's a tendency to be like, "No, this is how I remember it, and I'm the D.M., so that's the right way." When in fact, if that brings you into conflict with the players it's best to err on their side.
MCDM-1551|So that's just a little piece of advice about how to start your game. So I do use a D.M. Screen. I have ever since I started. And the 5th edition D.M. Screen, I think is actually pretty poor.
MCDM-1552|At least it's not, let me put it this way, it's not well suited for the way I run the game. You can kind of tell, based on what information Wizards of the Coast put on the D.M. Screen, what they expect you to be doing with the game.
MCDM-1553|For instance, there's a whole panel here, I don't know if you can see it, for N.P.C. generation. Rolling a random N.P.C. including giving him a random name. One quarter of this whole thing is dedicated to making random N.P.C.s
MCDM-1554|and that's not something I really need. It's easy for me to make up names and invent N.P.C.s on the fly; I'm a writer. So maybe you find that useful, maybe you like this D.M. Screen. There was also a cool chart on here which I like a lot, but never use called, "Something Happens."
MCDM-1555|And you roll a d20 whenever your game kind of grinds to a halt and the players are bickering and this helps you get inspiration for what to do next. For instance, you roll an 11 and someone gets angry.
MCDM-1556|And that's all good and well, but I have different needs as a D.M. In fact, one of the things I find baffling is that there is no list of things players do in combat telling me what types of actions they all are.
MCDM-1557|That's something I definitely need, because my players will often ask me, "Can I draw my weapon? Can I drink a potion? Can I use this magic item?" And I have to kind of make a ruling on the fly,
MCDM-1558|which is sort of how D&D 5 is supposed to be run, but there are answers to these things, they're in the Player's Handbook or the D.M.'s Guide, and I can never remember them off the top of my head.
MCDM-1559|That's one of the problems with having run the game for 30 years I remember lots of answers I remember the right answer from several different editions of the game,
MCDM-1560|which are now wrong answers. So it would be nice if that stuff were on here, and it kind of bums me out that it's not. But, the good news is, with only a little bit of work,
MCDM-1561|you can find online variations on this that other people have made. PDFs and Google Docs that you can download and print out and if you buy one of these you can just paperclip your own version to it.
MCDM-1562|I'll put a link in the doobely-do [description box] to a bunch of different versions. You can look at them, and pick the one you like. That is, if you decide to use a D.M. Screen. Like I said, not everybody does. I tend to think of not using a D.M. Screen as something old-school D.M.s do - older school than me.
MCDM-1563|But in point of fact, I read an article with Jordan Weisman, the guy that founded FASA and WizKids, in which he describes going to a game store that Dave Arneson ran, Dave Arneson is one of the guys who invented D&D,
MCDM-1564|and Dave Arneson ran D&D for Jordan and his buddies, and he did it from behind a full-body screen. He was completely obscured while he was running the game,
MCDM-1565|and I think the effect he was going for was the voice of an omniscient narrator coming from nowhere. Except of course, it's coming from behind that screen which is kind of weird to me. And I remember when this article came out, a lot of people said they thought that was weird,
MCDM-1566|and then a lot of people came out of the woodwork who had played back in the early 1970s and said, "No, actually, a lot of people, including Gary Guygax ran the game from behind full-body screens, you wouldn't see them at all." I'm not sure how long that tradition lasted,
MCDM-1567|but the idea was that you were exploring the dungeon, not reading the Dungeon Master and that obscuring his face meant that you couldn't see what his reaction was to the things that you were doing. It also gave him the opportunity to change maps behind the screen, and you wouldn't even know that he was doing it.
MCDM-1568|So, that seems pretty weird to me, but I bet if I had played back then I would have thought it was pretty neat. So, my friend Jim Murphy has been running D&D since around then, around 1976, and he never uses a D.M. Screen.
MCDM-1569|He thinks of them as a kind of crutch, and also he doesn't like that feeling of being separated from the players. And, keep in mind, this is one of the best D.M.s I've ever played with. But, and uh, he's not here to defend himself - I actually interviewed him for this
MCDM-1570|in fact, maybe I will, maybe I'll go and have coffee with Jim and I'll do a little Q&A with him. So, if you have any questions for a guy who ran D&D back in 1976, let me know and I'll ask Jim. So, I think the reason Jim doesn't use a D.M. Screen, is that he feels it's a kind of cheat.
MCDM-1571|He feels like if the players see you rolling behind the screen, then they will think the results aren't real. Whereas, if he rolls the dice in front of you, then you all know that is objectively what would have happened. "I rolled a 20 for the orc, he critically hits you."
MCDM-1572|I didn't just decide the orc critically hits you because  you've had an easy time of it this evening, We all saw the die, it said 20, you were critically hit. And that is undeniably true. When the players see you, the D.M., rolling in front of them
MCDM-1573|they suddenly get apprehensive. That is a real roll, and there's nothing anyone can do about it once it's done. And that's probably the number one job of the D.M. Screen, is to give you, the D.M., the opportunity to roll behind the screen.
MCDM-1574|Jim does not have the opportunity to roll behind the screen, he does not have the opportunity to, as they call it, to fudge the die roles. Why would you want to fudge the die rolls? Why would you want to lie to your players?
MCDM-1575|Well, don't think of it as lying to your players; think of it as curating the experience. In fact, original D&D, back in 1974, the D.M. rolled all the dice. He rolled the dice for your character's stats when you made your character.
MCDM-1576|Right, I want you to think about that. You didn't get to make your own character. The D.M. rolled all your stats, he rolled your hit rolls, he rolled your damage rolls.
MCDM-1577|Now, again, that seems super weird to me, But, when you think about it, that means that D&D back then was a much more curated experience. Let's say you wanted to play a fighter.
MCDM-1578|I would tell you "Oh, yeah, no, I rolled an 18 strength for you, fantastic, but I got a 6 intelligence." Right, I could give you a character with stats that were good in the things they needed to be good in, but I could one or two things that were not that good to give you some interesting roll playing challenges.
MCDM-1579|We don't do it that way anymore, although I think there still is a good reason for the D.M. to make some rolls. For instance, one thing many D.M.s do, and I have done in the past and I probably will do in the future, is they'll make a little cheat sheet behind the screen with each P.C.s name on it
MCDM-1580|and they'll have on there what each character's perception bonus is and their stealth bonus is. So that when the player says "I'll hide in the shadows," they don't roll, you roll. Okay, why would you do that?
MCDM-1581|Because, I think there's an argument to be made that it's unrealistic for a player to know, "Is my character successfully hiding in the shadows?" It doesn't matter what you roll, your character certainly thinks he's hiding in the shadows.
MCDM-1582|As opposed to an athletics check. If you try to jump a chasm, you objectively know if you've failed or not. But, something like hiding, I think, your character doesn't know how well hidden he is, so why should the player? And then you get some interesting drama. The player starts to wonder, "Did I make it? Did I do a good job?"
MCDM-1583|Now, that's not to everybody's taste; I don't do that currently. But, I'm thinking about doing it again; I think my players would like it. And there's a good argument to be made for doing the same thing with perception.
MCDM-1584|when you tell the players, "Okay, make a perception check." You just told them that there was something to notice. And if they all fail, they know that they didn't notice it.
MCDM-1585|And that is another way to break their similitude, I think. Break suspension of disbelief. Suddenly the players go "Ah, what did we miss?"
MCDM-1586|Which is not really what you want them to be thinking. So, again, there's not a right way to do this stuff, these are just suggestions. These are things I know D.Ms do, things I've done as a D.M.
MCDM-1587|And, in fact, I got the idea from my friend, Brad, who was one of my favorite D.M.s, he ran for me when I was a teenager, And, I, as a player, really liked the style of play. So, my friend Jim Murphy doesn't use a D.M. Screen, he always rolls all his rolls in front of the players.
MCDM-1588|And, as a result, there's a lot more tension when he rolls, because you know it's real quote, unquote, but the flip side of that is, and I'm not making this up, almost every campaign Jim has started, began with a total party kill.
MCDM-1589|Or sometimes there was one survivor. Whatever. And that's because often, Jim starts a new campaign when there's a new edition of D&D out, and since it's a new edition of D&D, he doesn't know the rules that well yet.
MCDM-1590|I've actually had conversations with him after the fact where he said, "Wow, you know, I thought that four spectors wasn't going to be that hard for you guys." Because he remembers and edition of D&D where four spectors wasn't that hard for us.
MCDM-1591|And because he doesn't roll behind the D.M. screen he doesn't have an opportunity mid-combit to go, "Wow, this battle is a lot tougher than I thought. I didn't mean for it to be this hard." So that's one of the purposes of the D.M. Screen. It's to help hide your screw-ups.
MCDM-1592|You didn't mean for this combat to be this difficult, but because you are rolling behind the screen you have the opportunity to kind of miss every once in awhile, do less damage than the dice actually said to do.
MCDM-1593|And this is something where the first time you do it, it might be obvious, but after you've gotten the hang of it you'll know how to do it in such a way that your players don't notice. I've gotten to the point now, I've been doing this for a while, where I generally roll in front of the players,
MCDM-1594|to increase that feeling of verisimilitude, but about 20-30 percent of the time, I roll behind the screen. And, most of the time the only reason I'm doing that,
MCDM-1595|is so that when I need to roll behind the screen it doesn't look so suspicious. Right, if you only every roll behind the screen, because you need to fudge a roll, your players will notice. One thing I try to avoid doing is fudging my dice to keep a bad guy alive just because I like them.
MCDM-1596|Trust me, there are better ways to do that. One trick I've used, and this works especially well when the bad guy is an evil priest of a dark god, is if the bad guys isn't being as effective as I thought he would be and the players are going to kill him earlier than I thought,
MCDM-1597|I just let them do their thing, the bad guys dies, and then I have their god kind of show up and say, "No, I have plans for you; rise." And now they fight an undead, more empowered version, of that same bad guy. That may seem kind of video-gamey, but when it's happening to the players in the heat of combat,
MCDM-1598|and it's the villain of the adventure, it will seem epic. So, that's the D.M. Screen episode. Actually, I pulled out all my old D.M. Screens, you can see my old Birthright Screen here,
MCDM-1599|this is from 1994, 1996 I think? It's pretty epic. I apologize, the my mic quality is going to drop a little bit, here. And you can see that back in the day, the D.M. Screen was not, it wasn't landscape, it was portrait.
MCDM-1600|I also have my slightly less-old Third Edition D.M. Screen. I have run every edition of D&D since A D&D I love them all for one reason or another, and in every instance I got burned out on them eventually.
MCDM-1601|Just because, the burden of some rules became, wow...holy crap, look at this. There is, I have...this is a little bit of memorabilia here, for me... This is a little cheat sheet I made.
MCDM-1602|I'll take a picture of it, and put it up there so you can see it. I would do this all the time; you know, I should start doing it again. It's just a list of all the different P.C.s in my game, and then a bunch of columns.
MCDM-1603|And, in one column is their armor class. That saves a lot of time because I roll the dice and I know whether I hit or not. I don't have to say, "What's your armor class again?" I also have on here each character's max hit points, and I would keep track of their current hit points over the course of the battle.
MCDM-1604|Now that does cost more work from your point of view as a D.M., and it may not be worth it for you, but I liked knowing what the players' current and total hit points were for a couple reasons. For one thing, as the P.C.s level up, the difference in their hit points starts to become significant,
MCDM-1605|and doing 20 points of damage to one character might bring them from full hit points to almost dead, whereas that same 20 points to another character might only take them to half damage. And it's useful to know, "Which character am I about to kill with this attack?"
MCDM-1606|Also, keeping track of the running total means you know when you are about to kill a character, and I find that is useful information. Now, the goal here isn't to kill or not kill characters.
MCDM-1607|The goal here is just to provide a plausible dramatic experience. And sometimes you may discover that your own ignorance, or the players' ignorance, or the dice, undermine that. I've had evenings where I couldn't roll less than a 17, and I realized, "If I keep doing this, the players are all going to die!"
MCDM-1608|This wasn't a tough encounter until I couldn't miss. The opposite also happens. Sometimes I can't roll higher than a three and I think, "this is ridiculous, this is a cake walk." and the players feel let down. They were expecting something dramatic, and in fact, it turns out to be not that memorable.
MCDM-1609|Now, not every fight needs to be memorable. You should only be challenging the players at certain moments in the adventure. I'll have another episode talking about pacing.
MCDM-1610|It's one of those things that, once you've done it a couple times, you start to get the hang of it, but when you know each character's current hit points, that gives you the opportunity to have the bad guys discreetly switch targets from one to the other, so you don't end up accidentally killing a character when you didn't mean to.
MCDM-1611|Lastly, I wrote down each character's saving throws, and I put a box around which one had the worst saving throw in each category, and that helped me making decisions running the bad guys. In a certain sense it's cheating, because obviously the bad guys don't know what the different character's saving throws are,
MCDM-1612|but in another sense, the bad guys, I think, are roughly as intelligent as the good guys, usually, and you can tell which of these characters is the priest, just like the good guys can tell which of the bad guys is the shaman, and typically the priest has a high wisdom save, so don't cast spells on that character that require wisdom save.
MCDM-1613|Just like you can tell the thief is the nimble, dexterous one; don't attack them with something that requires a reflex save. I think it's reasonable to assume you can tell by looking at a character which one's the smart one, which one's the nimble one, which one's the heavily armored one, and make decisions accordingly.
MCDM-1614|But if you don't have these numbers, then actually it can kind of get confusing. It's also useful, because as the players accrue abilities and magic items, it may seem harder and harder to challenge them.
MCDM-1615|Remember, they out number you, you know, 5 or 6 to 1. So, having a little cheat sheet like this with their hit points and armor class and their saving throws which gives you some idea of what the party's weaknesses are, can make combat a little more interesting.
MCDM-1616|I guarantee you that some people are going to say that this is cheating, and that's fine, don't do it if you don't think it's a good idea. I don't do this anymore; I haven't done this in a long time. Although, I'm thinking that maybe I should do it again. So that's the D.M. Screen episode. Like I said, you'll find links in the doobley doo [description box] to lots of other,
MCDM-1617|alternative D.M. Screens that other players, like you, have made, that you can print out, and if you go and buy a D.M. Screen, you know, from your game store you can then just paperclip the printouts to the inside, and that allows you to customize your D.M. Screen
MCDM-1618|and put whatever you want in there. Thanks for watching. I hope you liked that episode. If you want to help support the channel, there's a link to my amazon page in the doobley doo [description box].
MCDM-1619|I'm an independent fantasy author in my spare time; I write fantasy novels. If you like D&D, or you just like fantasy, you might like them. Read the reviews, read the descriptions, see what you think, check it out. I'd also like to give a shot out to my friend Jay, Jason Hill, who is one of the people who inspired me to start this channel.
MCDM-1620|Jay has his own channel where he will help teach you how to be 3-d modeler and a character designer. That's what he does for Turtle Rock Studios. Jay's an incredibly talented guy. He's one of my best friends. I feel lucky to know him.
MCDM-1621|Jay, I love you. Jay has a great video where he sculpts Judge Dredd in Zebra. I'll put a link to that in the doobley doo [description box]. Go to his channel, watch his video, let him know what characters from movies you'd like to see him sculpt, that'll motivate him to make more videos.
MCDM-1622|He and I are having kind of a friendly rivalry where we are trying to see which one of us can get to 5,000 subscribers first. He has a huge head start on me, but I'm catching up. So, go check out his videos, and subscribe, but not until I hit 5,000 first.
MCDM-1623|Next week we are going to talk about, what is in the box, [box clanks as shaken] and why it might destroy your campaign, unless you are clever, and take my advice and use it in an interesting way. Till next time. Peace. Out.
MCDM-1624|I know how it seems running D DS is crazy juggling act keeping all these balls in the air you feel like you're
MCDM-1625|riding a catastrophy weight that could collapse at any minute well the good news is when you fail it's question a
MCDM-1626|win not if your friends will remember they'll be impressed you could do it at all
MCDM-1627|Kent at the end of the day the price of failure is no big deal Oh shucks I would've brought him out if
MCDM-1628|I didn't know how to use them shucks I wouldn't put it on less I'm good at it on today's episode we're
MCDM-1629|gonna talk about failure Cass trophic failure like happened to me a couple of weeks ago in my D&D game so those of you
MCDM-1630|who have been following my videos and who remember the episode about the black pudding you may remember me talking
MCDM-1631|about how that one encounter with this news changed my campaign in fact it did a lot more than that it resulted in me
MCDM-1632|killing my boss and I phrased it that way because that's the most dramatic way I can think of doing it but that's not
MCDM-1633|how I felt I felt like I had killed my friends character and that was awful I hated it I hated everything that
MCDM-1634|happened that night it was a terrible evening but we survived it and we're gonna talk about
MCDM-1635|how in order to really understand what happened there's gonna be a lot of stuff in the doobly-doo for you to download
MCDM-1636|and read at your leisure it's all optional you should be able to understand the story without it for the
MCDM-1637|second Turtle Rock Studios D&D group I sent an email out to the players and the title of the email was the baron of beta
MCDM-1638|guard is dead his family murdered now the political situation in the barony in which the game started I considered
MCDM-1639|somewhat optional if the players were interested in engaging with it that's cool if they weren't that's cool too I
MCDM-1640|had an adventure ready that would have hooks into that politics but didn't require the players being interested in
MCDM-1641|it they could just be interested in dungeon delving and they still have a lot of fun I thought now that email is
MCDM-1642|in the doobly-doo there's also a description of my campaign setting which is a one-page description because I
MCDM-1643|think that way people are more likely to read it and there's a map and all the stuff you would expect and in this
MCDM-1644|description it talks about how humans don't trust elves and dwarves for various reasons there is the bad guy
MCDM-1645|who's like 17th level so it's not something you worry about at low levels the invincible overlord
MCDM-1646|and he has taken over the entire area and in order for the dwarves to continue to govern themselves how they want they
MCDM-1647|have to give the invincible overlords slaves so now the dwarves are famous as slow
MCDM-1648|now how do you as a door feel about that that's up to you one of the players as a dwarf player and he read that stuff and
MCDM-1649|he was aware of it but I think he thought of it as kind of not applying to him that's Matt's weird campaign stuff
MCDM-1650|what do I care I'm a cool dwarf war cleric again that didn't bother me I didn't think the players had any
MCDM-1651|obligation to engage with this stuff I think a lot of players like playing non-human characters because they play a
MCDM-1652|human in real life but I like running games that have a political element to them and so I tend to run a humano
MCDM-1653|centric campaign one of the players in fact said I'm gonna play a human druid because everyone you're setting is a
MCDM-1654|xenophobe that's not literally true there's nothing racial about the wait humans treat dwarves it's purely because
MCDM-1655|the dwarves made this bargain this Faustian deal with the invincible overlord I thought that'd be a cool hook
MCDM-1656|for a dwarf player to be disgusted with that and be here with the humans because he's trying to do something about it
MCDM-1657|this is all important to the story stay tuned so there's the original email I sent out describing the central tension
MCDM-1658|of the campaign and we'll do a video on central tensions later I think they're critically important to a good campaign
MCDM-1659|and then I sent out the campaign one-page summary which talked about how many of these species don't trust each
MCDM-1660|other because of the pressure of the invincible overlord and then the players found this super important artifact
MCDM-1661|called the shield of and rim the shield of and room is one of a set there's a shield as a sword as a crown and they
MCDM-1662|confer nobility and room is the name of the entire map that I present the players and there hasn't been a king of
MCDM-1663|and room for a long time somebody with the shield of Andrea could declare themselves the king of and Rim and
MCDM-1664|especially if they were a hero who would save the town or maybe even the entire barony people would follow them and when
MCDM-1665|our players took the shield to their friendly neighborhood high level wizard NPC he expressly told them whatever you
MCDM-1666|do with that do not take it to the city of Boettiger keep because stuff that's happening there is bad news I don't
MCDM-1667|trust the regent it's best that you guys keep it you're going to go into the swamp anyway and go fight some goblins
MCDM-1668|so armed with this information the players made a decision they needed new armor they needed better weapons and the
MCDM-1669|only place they could get heavy armor and heavy weapons was Boettiger key so they strode into Boettiger keep all
MCDM-1670|unawares up until this point there was no need for them to pay attention to the politics of the city but from one point
MCDM-1671|of view that ignorance cost them in fact it cost one player his character when the players entered Boettiger cape i
MCDM-1672|showed them the map which you can see here and i described place is the word to visit they go to
MCDM-1673|the blacksmith they go to the tavern there's a church in town and that's unusual because up until now I described
MCDM-1674|every town in the area as having a ruined church in fact the players had visited a ruin to church and I described
MCDM-1675|that the invincible overlord does not like organized religion in fact it isn't like much organization that isn't his
MCDM-1676|own and in each instance I thought there was a reason the players would visit each of these one of the players needed
MCDM-1677|new arms and armor so he'd go to the blacksmith I expected the thief to want to go to the in the tavern and do some
MCDM-1678|investigation and find out hey what's going on in this town I expected maybe one of the players to go to the church
MCDM-1679|and check it out why is there a church here but the players didn't do at almost any of that they wanted to go visit the
MCDM-1680|wizard and get their stuff identified they had magic items I want to get identified and there were friends with
MCDM-1681|this wizard but they also had a note which you can see here which you can download describing the bad guys plan to
MCDM-1682|kidnap this wizard so they arrived in town and they all decide to go see the wizard with one exception
MCDM-1683|the dwarf says I don't care about visiting the wizard I want to go to the blacksmith and get a new suit of armor
MCDM-1684|and a new weapon because the black pudding corroded his so the dwarf war priest goes to the blacksmith everyone
MCDM-1685|else goes to visit the wizard they knock on the door and a knight opens the door now the last time the players had
MCDM-1686|visited this wizard it was in his mobile tower his Darrin's instant fortress which was something they found in the
MCDM-1687|road while they were trying to track him down and just like then when they arrived at his mobile tower there was a
MCDM-1688|knight there and when they knocked on the door this Knight opened the door but that night was an ally of the wizard and
MCDM-1689|the players got to know her lady Avelina these Knights were unknown to the players now there were two knights in
MCDM-1690|the tower at this point Knights of the Black Rose and unbeknownst to the players these are high-level bad guy
MCDM-1691|Knights most of them are fighters a couple of them are evil paladin's specifically I think of them as ill
MCDM-1692|riggers from this great issue of Dragon Magazine stay with me this story has an ending the two Knights look at each
MCDM-1693|other and say who are you guys and the hero say we are friends of the wizard taste and they say really will the
MCDM-1694|wizard is missing and the players say well we just saw him not even a week ago and the two Knights look at each other
MCDM-1695|and they whisper they talk to each other and they say you may be the last people to see the wizard alive would you be
MCDM-1696|willing to come talk to the regent and tell him what happened now this is a critical moment because
MCDM-1697|from this point forward the players options begin to narrow and they sense this but didn't know what they could do
MCDM-1698|about it one of the players said wait are these Knights the same Knights that we met last time and I said no these
MCDM-1699|Knights have black roses on their Harold so that was an ill omen now these Knights had a plan let's get these rat
MCDM-1700|catchers these mercenaries into the keep away from prying eyes where we can accuse them of whatever we want and then
MCDM-1701|hang them and in the morning the townspeople will wake up and see these dead adventurers and we'll tell them
MCDM-1702|these are the people that kidnapped and killed our wizard thereby relieving themselves of any guilt
MCDM-1703|so these Knights are acting suspiciously but I didn't want them to act too suspiciously because then it would be
MCDM-1704|obvious and they are trying to trick the players the players agreed their leader is the wizard skoros their pc wizard who
MCDM-1705|is a very lawful good character and basically goes along with whatever the law says and whatever the right thing to
MCDM-1706|do is so when these Knights say will you come with us and talk to the region he's like sure and everyone goes with him so
MCDM-1707|as they go from the Wizards tower to the keep they pick up another Knight now there are three Knights guarding them as
MCDM-1708|you can see their window has narrowed now they can take on two knights probably three Knights that's still
MCDM-1709|doable but then they enter the keep without any objection and they end up outside the region's receiving room in
MCDM-1710|this a little for yay and now there are four knights and the players are now very suspicious one of them says can I
MCDM-1711|make a roll to see if I suspect anything and that kind of baffled me because I felt like you suspect them you obviously
MCDM-1712|have a suspicion otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that act on that suspicion but I realized that what the player
MCDM-1713|really wanted was some kind of objective omniscient narrator confirmation of that suspicion so I said yeah go right ahead
MCDM-1714|and roll make an intuition check he rolled really high and so I texted the player you are being set up now at that
MCDM-1715|point I really think the only thing the players could do would be attack these four Knights because from this point
MCDM-1716|forward things are only going to get worse their options are only going to narrow but the player tried to go to the
MCDM-1717|bathroom do you mind if I excused myself go to the Privy and the four Knights of course don't want these people going
MCDM-1718|anywhere they're trying to trap them and say no no one visits the Privy while you're waiting to talk to the Regent and
MCDM-1719|at that point the players were ushered in to see the region too now there are six nights there is the evil priest and
MCDM-1720|the Regent the regent of Boettiger Lord sexton I tried to pick a name that was ominous
MCDM-1721|the players are now in this long hallway with big stained-glass windows this is where the Baron of betta gar used to
MCDM-1722|receive people and his throne remains empty nearby is a much smaller throne that the Regent uses and he asked the
MCDM-1723|players to describe what happened when they saw taste and they start telling him but he is not really interested this
MCDM-1724|was all a ruse the players away from the public getting them away from the townspeople into this
MCDM-1725|yo room where it's just him and his knights and they can do whatever they want so he starts saying some ominous
MCDM-1726|things to the players the PC Wizards Kouros says hang on the minute wait a minute we didn't have anything to do
MCDM-1727|with the disappearance of taste we have this note from the bad guys saying how they're gonna kidnap the wizard the
MCDM-1728|region says may I see that note and the wizard Skaro says absolutely here you go the region takes it looks at it and rips
MCDM-1729|a tie he says arrest those men because I want to remove any ambiguity at this point
MCDM-1730|and the players were wondering why they're being arrested I had the Regent turned to his priest and say we can pin
MCDM-1731|the disappearance on the wizard on these rat catchers no one will guess that we had anything to do with it now that was
MCDM-1732|the end of that session I said we'll pick it up next week and it'll be initiative the players spent the next
MCDM-1733|week talking about what they could do the thief's player asked me is it reasonable for me to have my thieves
MCDM-1734|tools like hidden about my person so that if I'm captured and searched they won't find them I said do it as far as
MCDM-1735|I'm concerned you always have your thieves tools hidden about your person you're a thief I mean unless you're in
MCDM-1736|the dungeon in which case it makes sense to have them handy otherwise when you're in town why would you have them anywhere
MCDM-1737|else I wanted that player to understand that if he got captured he would probably be able to get out of a jail
MCDM-1738|cell using as these tools meanwhile the wizard player said guys I don't know about you but I'll be able to get out of
MCDM-1739|here I have invisibility memorized also the druid player said I don't about you guys but I can turn into a spider and I
MCDM-1740|can get out of here if we end up in jail I can just slip through the bars so I felt as though we had a pretty good
MCDM-1741|session lined up for the next week the players were gonna get arrested they were going to end up in jail and they
MCDM-1742|were gonna try to find a way out and they would discover what had happened to the dwarf player who wasn't with them
MCDM-1743|remember the dwarf war priest was talking to the blacksmith and something extraordinary happened I would switch
MCDM-1744|between the players in the kief and the dwarf at the blacksmith and go back and forth to try to keep everybody engaged
MCDM-1745|and so the dwarf Wahoos that the blacksmith walks up to this huge cumin so very large blacksmith there are lots
MCDM-1746|of people in here doing work and lots of customers the dwarf says excuse me master Smith I need some new armor and a
MCDM-1747|new weapon and the Smith spits on the ground and says I do not deal with slavers now this was the first time the
MCDM-1748|dwarf player ever had to deal with that prejudice and I was sort of curious as to what he would do because this was a
MCDM-1749|player who hadn't done a lot of role-playing up until now I was kind of amazed the dwarf player went for it he
MCDM-1750|role played he spoke in character he was a dwarf he wasn't gonna let this guy talk to like this and he wasn't a slaver
MCDM-1751|and he told the Smith I'm not flavor in fact I saved the people of gravis further nearby town near to betta
MCDM-1752|gar keep there was being attacked by Undead and my friends and I saved that whole place
MCDM-1753|he gave an impassioned in character speech I was impressed but I thought it would probably take a little bit more
MCDM-1754|than you know one mouthy dwarf to change this blacksmith's mind so I said alright I'll give you a 20% chance that someone
MCDM-1755|from the nearby town of gravis bur that you had saved is here in betta gar keep I mean this is the local big city so of
MCDM-1756|course there's people moving back and forth all the time so the dwarf player rolled percentile dice enrolled a 19 so
MCDM-1757|I had a customer in the Smith who say he's right he's telling the truth I was there I remember him they're heroes they
MCDM-1758|saved us the blacksmith was like wow I I guess I was wrong at this point the dwarf pushed his luck I think because he
MCDM-1759|was trying to get better prices for his gear and he said you're right I'm a hero in fact I'm a friend of taste the Beres
MCDM-1760|wizard tastes yours towns wizard you should be nice to me at that point he feels fingers pinching his elbow and a
MCDM-1761|figure a small figure at a siding he turns and he looks and there's a halfling there and the halfling says uh
MCDM-1762|excuse me friend your voice carries shouldn't we be talking about this outside and the dwarf player realizes
MCDM-1763|that something strange is going on he goes on uh yeah let's talk outside he asks the Smith to hang on a minute and
MCDM-1764|he and the halfling go outside so this point I take of the dwarf player outside and we roleplay his conversation with a
MCDM-1765|halfling out of your shot of the rest of the group so they and for the next week have no idea what happened between the
MCDM-1766|door for the halfling the halfling says what's wrong with you don't you know what's going on don't you know that
MCDM-1767|taste is missing because he was loyal to the Baron the Baron and his family were murdered and everyone thinks the regent
MCDM-1768|did it and the dwarf says whoa no I had no idea the halfling says where are your friends where's the rest of the party
MCDM-1769|that saved the people of greatest verse and the dwarf says well they're all talking to the wizard and a thing says
MCDM-1770|oh my god the Black Rose are going to arrest them take them to the region and they're going to be accused of the
MCDM-1771|Wizards murder the halfling says what would you be willing to do to save your friends and the dwarf said I would be
MCDM-1772|willing to do anything I would risk my life to save my friends of course he would he's a dwarf the halfling says
MCDM-1773|yeah okay having you guys owe us a favor isn't bad and if you guys can find taste and save him
MCDM-1774|then taste would owe us a favor and that's not bad either all right I'll help you out the halfling says and
MCDM-1775|reaches behind his neck and pulls out like a leather thong this key he snaps the key off and he says this is a
MCDM-1776|skeleton key to the Barons prisons now the Regent may have changed the locks but if he hasn't this will get you in or
MCDM-1777|out of any door in the jail he says how can we hide this about your person so that they won't
MCDM-1778|find you if you happen to get arrested they'll search you I know come here he says now the player who plays this dwarf
MCDM-1779|has this great beard so I walk up and make like I'm trying to fiddle with his beard and I say the halfling starts
MCDM-1780|braiding the key into your beard he says they'll never look forward here the dwarf player thinks this is awesome
MCDM-1781|he's like oh this is going to be amazing yeah my beard smart then the halfling draws a picture of the keep in the sand
MCDM-1782|and says this is the keep and this is the Wizards tower nearby and this is the secret corridor that connects the two
MCDM-1783|underground in the same level as the jails so if you can get your friends out you don't have to try to escape through
MCDM-1784|the keep you can escape through the secret corridor and up and out through the Wizards tower the dwarf is now
MCDM-1785|incredibly stoked because he is certain he knows what's gonna happen they're gonna get arrested they're gonna be in
MCDM-1786|jail and he's gonna help bust him out and that's kind of what I thought was gonna happen but that's not what
MCDM-1787|happened so here is this week's lesson never take away your players agency I mean I'm sure there can be people in the
MCDM-1788|comments that say oh I've done it before and it worked great well fine I'm sure there are exceptions but I have now done
MCDM-1789|this three or four times since I was 15 and every single time it is failed any time you set your players up in a
MCDM-1790|situation where they have to surrender they will not you can begin an adventure with the players captured in jail in
MCDM-1791|fact that's how out of the abyss begins and I think it's fantastic but you can't put the players in that scenario they
MCDM-1792|will never go for it they will always try to fight their way out in fact they will fight their way out on purpose even
MCDM-1793|if they know they will fail just to be stubborn just to show you how much they hate it and you know what I've done the
MCDM-1794|same thing as a player even as a player this is why I should have known and whatever happens from here on out it is
MCDM-1795|not the players fault it's my fault I set them up for this I should not have I should have known better I've had the
MCDM-1796|same thing happened to me as a player and I hated it and I rebelled at it the same way they did nobody throws me my
MCDM-1797|own guns and says ride nobody nobody throat me my own gun it says run nobody so the next week when it was
MCDM-1798|initiative the dwarf player is sitting there waiting for them to get captured he's super excited to see what's going
MCDM-1799|to happen but the players have concocted their own plan now since the week before they have sort of realized the scenario
MCDM-1800|they're in they realize they have brought the shield of and room to the Regent they have brought him the thing
MCDM-1801|he needs to legitimize his rule the one thing their NPC buddy tasteless who told him not to do so now they're going to do
MCDM-1802|anything to stop him from getting that shield including risk of their own lives including suicide if it comes down to it
MCDM-1803|and you know what that's super dramatic and in a sense it worked there was an epic battle in which the wizard gave his
MCDM-1804|pack to the half-orc fighter the half war fighter has the shield and now the half war fighter has the shield and the
MCDM-1805|Wizards spell book the wizard was very afraid of his spell book getting captured by the bad guys the wizard then
MCDM-1806|casts invisibility on the half work he had originally planned on casting on himself kind of selfishly so that he
MCDM-1807|knew he would escape but now he's doing it selflessly he's saying you go invisible take the shield take all our
MCDM-1808|gear get out of here and this amazing chess game played out where the bad guys attacked the player-character wizard to
MCDM-1809|disrupt his concentration that caused the half-orc to go from being invisible to visible then the bad guy priest casts
MCDM-1810|whole person on the orc and freezes the orc then the good guys attack the evil priest and disrupt his concentration
MCDM-1811|causing the orc to be able to move again back and forth it goes players go down players go back up these Knights turn
MCDM-1812|out to be incredibly tough but so are the players three of them escape two of them are captured the wizard is attacked
MCDM-1813|by one of the paladins and goes down in one shot because I had sort of forgotten or maybe I didn't even really know that
MCDM-1814|the third-level wizard at max hip points has ten hit points so in fact I did enough damage to him
MCDM-1815|to kill him outright and I said no no they're not trying to kill you they're attacking to subdue remember they want
MCDM-1816|you guys to hang in the morning they want to kill you here where no one's watching now from one point of view that
MCDM-1817|was an epic battle but from another point of view it was miserable because the players were constantly describing
MCDM-1818|how they felt like they had no choice they felt like there was nothing they could do they felt like they had been
MCDM-1819|railroaded and that made me feel bad so I wasn't having a good time so even though if this had been any other
MCDM-1820|scenario I think everyone would have thought wow that was an epic battle it didn't feel that way it felt like this
MCDM-1821|intense struggle for or control over player agency the three players escape they steal some horses
MCDM-1822|they ride to the blacksmith they find the door for they say we got to get out of here the dwarf says wait a minute
MCDM-1823|wait a man I need to tell you what happened and the players say no no no time to explain
MCDM-1824|get on the horse the dwarf says ok and gets on the horse and they ride out of town so for the players are out of town
MCDM-1825|two of the players are captured the two captured players wake up in the jail they're not sure how much time has gone
MCDM-1826|by I think that's maybe an important point as far as they knew they could be about to be hung you'll be caught and
MCDM-1827|damn well hung I think he looks pretty well madam please we have no time the guard is one of the Knights it's not a
MCDM-1828|typical man-at-arms this is a powerful night one of the nights that almost killed them a minute ago the two players
MCDM-1829|who were captured the wizard in the druid asked me to describe the jail cell really requests they say can I see the
MCDM-1830|other player are the walls barred or are they stone walls I said well let me draw it out for you that was a mistake
MCDM-1831|me drawing it on the battle map sent the signal that this was a combat encounter and the implication with a combat
MCDM-1832|encounter is that there is a way to win but I didn't mean either of those things I didn't intend this to be a combat
MCDM-1833|encounter at all and I certainly didn't think there was a way for them to get out of this they were both manacled so
MCDM-1834|they couldn't cast spells but I didn't know what kind of signal I was sending so I drew the jail on the mat and I put
MCDM-1835|the Paladin guard where she was and I put the PCs where they were in opposite jail cells and they shared a language
MCDM-1836|they could talk to each other which I didn't know which meant when they were in the for yay and the Druids suspected
MCDM-1837|that these guys were trying to set them up he could have said something in a language that the paladins and the
MCDM-1838|guards couldn't understand and maybe come up with a scenario where they could jump the guards when there were only
MCDM-1839|four of them so these two players captured start talking about how they might be able to get out and the wizard
MCDM-1840|player incredibly bravely said I am going to say the worst most hateful most disgusting things I can to this female
MCDM-1841|guard to get her to come over here and face me now the actual player my friend Phil is not that bad a guy so he doesn't
MCDM-1842|know what to say that would cause her to do that but just telling me my character says those things was enough and it
MCDM-1843|worked they may be in a dire role I don't remember and the guard walks up opens the door to his Jail walks into
MCDM-1844|his cell and says you're to hang in the morning no one said you needed a tongue to do that the implication here was
MCDM-1845|clear she's going to cut out his tongue if he keep talking at this point because of the way
MCDM-1846|the jail cells were situated she has her back to the druid player and unbeknownst to me wild shape is not a spell you
MCDM-1847|don't need your hands-free to be able to do it so the druid player turns into a spider behind the guards back and
MCDM-1848|escapes and now at this point everyone has escaped except the wizard player the Paladin on guard lady Morgan seeing that
MCDM-1849|the druid has escaped behind her back draws her sword and executes skoros the wizard and at that point all hell broke
MCDM-1850|loose the wizard player had no problem with the reality of that it was clear to him that he was at her mercy and she
MCDM-1851|could do this anytime she wanted he was just trying to distract her so the druid could escape but what he didn't know or
MCDM-1852|what he hadn't considered was that this humiliated her and that made her incredibly angry and she is not a
MCDM-1853|regular man-at-arms she is an evil bad guy paladin that we are setting up to be the recurring villains of this adventure
MCDM-1854|first of all she had no idea that either of the PCs could escape and now one of them under her charge is gone and as far
MCDM-1855|as she was concerned the other player character could do the same thing and there was no way she was going to her
MCDM-1856|boss the region is saying I let them both go angry at being humiliated and wanting to make sure that she was at
MCDM-1857|least able to tell her boss one of them didn't get away she executes the wizard now it's reasonable for somebody
MCDM-1858|watching this listen to this to think I did that to teach somebody a lesson but nothing could be further from the truth
MCDM-1859|in fact he was maybe the only player I would have gone that far with because of all the players at the table my friend
MCDM-1860|Phil playing the wizard was the one who was the most skeptical of me letting the players off the hook he's the one who
MCDM-1861|would say Matt's taking it easy on us in fact at one point he said you took it easy on us last night and I'm like what
MCDM-1862|are you talking about and he goes no I know what you did you stopped kind of paying attention to how we were managing
MCDM-1863|light because you knew that otherwise we were gonna get smoked by these goblins in the mine and I was like Phil I don't
MCDM-1864|really know how the rules for light work I didn't do anything to take it easy on you I just forgot but that's how he
MCDM-1865|thinks and I guess maybe I'm projecting too because that's how I think as a player I'm always kind of because I'm a
MCDM-1866|GM I'm always kind of aware of when the dungeon master is making allowances behind the screen to keep the players
MCDM-1867|alive when it otherwise wouldn't be realistic so I thought of all the players there he was the one who
MCDM-1868|wouldn't let me get away with it I felt like I had to do the most realistic plausible thing and in that
MCDM-1869|moment to me there was no way a humiliated evil night was going to let this guy live when lady Morgana realized
MCDM-1870|all the awful things the wizard had said or just a trick and not only had she been tricked but the result of the trick
MCDM-1871|was that the druid player de scaped she was humiliated and in her anger she was capable of anything
MCDM-1872|now when the druid player heard this he said you know what I go back in there and commit suicide against the night I
MCDM-1873|don't want to play anymore this is how unhappy everybody was a large percentage of the players thought this is it we're
MCDM-1874|not playing gened anymore everything has collapsed Phil got up and left now we were playing at work so Phil is
MCDM-1875|now walking around the office at nine o'clock at night and the other people who are there late working or like hey
MCDM-1876|Phil what's going on how's D&D and he is furious my friend Wes said well Matt runs a
MCDM-1877|pretty fair game I guess if you died then there was a good reason and feels like no there was not a good reason part
MCDM-1878|of this is the fact that all through this the players had kind of been bouncing around from one encounter to
MCDM-1879|the next without a whole lot of rhyme or reason and of all the players phil was the most upset by this he was often
MCDM-1880|asking why are we doing this he was the player who was the most upset that they didn't think enough and he's the one
MCDM-1881|that paid the price for everything so it was maximally unjust Phil walked around and talked to some of the other
MCDM-1882|employees blew off some steam and came back sat down and said okay I just need to talk about what happened and that's
MCDM-1883|another lesson when a catastrophe like this occurs it's important that everybody just talk it out describe your
MCDM-1884|perspective to the players why did everything happen you know normally I do not tell the players what their choices
MCDM-1885|are I do not tell the players what they could do in town I do not tell the players what they could do in battle
MCDM-1886|because I sort of feel like that's taking some of the fun away from the players it's disrespectful part of the
MCDM-1887|fun of D&D is you as a player coming up with this stuff but a lot of these players have never played before they
MCDM-1888|literally don't know what the traditions are that I take for granted so we spent the next two hours talking about what it
MCDM-1889|just happened the druid player explained that the reason he committed suicide against the paladin was because he
MCDM-1890|didn't want to play anymore if Phil wasn't gonna play but Phil's reaction was what are you talking about
MCDM-1891|NACA where as far as Phil was concerned we were gonna keep playing he was just really angry now
MCDM-1892|and wanted to talk about what happened I explained the palette of this point of view which I normally don't do but this
MCDM-1893|situation demanded it and Phil thought about it and said okay yeah all right that makes sense I buy it and the party
MCDM-1894|kind of talked the druid player down admittedly he had been complaining about having migraines
MCDM-1895|all night so that's another lesson don't play angry don't play with migraines you know there are a lot of
MCDM-1896|things you know we'd all been at work for eight hours up until then and so there are a lot of things that
MCDM-1897|contribute to players making bad decisions there are a lot of things that contribute to DMS making bad decisions
MCDM-1898|after about half an hour Phil start to think about his new character I said you want a role stance and he said yes now
MCDM-1899|if you've watched my videos before you know I have my own system for generating stats a role for d68 is three but you do
MCDM-1900|them in order so your first role is your strength your second role is your decks and that way players don't bring their
MCDM-1901|own baggage to the table and you get this cool or ocular process of discovering your character but the flip
MCDM-1902|side of that rule is if that character doesn't live you get to roll the normal way which is rule 46 take the highest
MCDM-1903|three and place them wherever you want so you can play whatever character you want immediately Phil started to roll up
MCDM-1904|a new warlock and he was really excited by this warlock and I quoted my friend Mark who once said to me you know Matt
MCDM-1905|when you kill one of my characters I am really legitimately angry at you for about half an hour I am furious at you
MCDM-1906|and he said let me be furious do not try to change what happened to bring my character back from the dead just
MCDM-1907|because I'm unhappy because that's also not satisfying that's not what would have happened just let me be angry for
MCDM-1908|about half an hour and then I'll relax and I'll start thinking about my new character and when I told the party this
MCDM-1909|Phil smiled and nodded and said it's literally been half an hour and now I'm back to wanting to play this new
MCDM-1910|character the other players had never really thought about what would happen when someone died for many of them a
MCDM-1911|player dying meant that was it that was the end of D&D and we had to explain especially Phil and I would play D&D a
MCDM-1912|lot before that look no player dying is not the end of the game when the Drude player realized this he said okay well
MCDM-1913|then in that case I would not have gone in the commit suicide and at this point it started to feel like okay we're all
MCDM-1914|gonna get to keep playing together now the door player finally says guys can I tell you what happened with me and the
MCDM-1915|halfling and he describes this whole scenario they had in their pocket the entire time the opportunity for the
MCDM-1916|dwarf to bust them out of jail but the party never really got arrested only two of the players did and then one of them
MCDM-1917|escaped and the other one was killed so the dwarf never got to do his cool stuff now we've played several times
MCDM-1918|since then we're gonna play again Monday and everything seems to be back to normal and the players are a more
MCDM-1919|cohesive group now than they were before in fact I think every time we play the group is a little bit more tight-knit
MCDM-1920|and my friend Phil who lost his wizard is now playing a warlock and he spent more time on that characters backstory
MCDM-1921|then all the other players put together he made it a point to make his character from the bearing of betta gar so he
MCDM-1922|knows all this stuff he knows who all the bad guys are he knows what happened to the Baron
MCDM-1923|he knows what anyone from this area would know all the stuff that the players have up until now kind of been
MCDM-1924|ignoring so even though he lost a character he is super engaged with what's going on also he has a lot more
MCDM-1925|hit points now so it's a lot more likely to live so what are the lessons to be taken away from this one my overwhelming
MCDM-1926|piece of advice to you is never put the players in a situation where you're taking their agency their ability to
MCDM-1927|decide their own fate away from them in other words never put a gun to their head and say surrender because they
MCDM-1928|won't they will come up with a perfectly plausible reasonable way to escape and try to thwart whatever plan you have
MCDM-1929|like I said I'm sure there's someone who's gonna say no no we've done it before it works fine but in my
MCDM-1930|experience that's never happened even as a player whenever I'm a DM anytime the players are in a scenario where the DM
MCDM-1931|thought they should or would surrender they'd never do that when Phil's character scores died Phil was very
MCDM-1932|mature about the whole thing he got incredibly angry right but he got up and he left he walked it off and then he
MCDM-1933|came back and said let's talk about what happened I need to understand and I explained my point of view and now of
MCDM-1934|course thanks to the dwarf the players have made contact with the local Thieves Guild that have some interest in maybe
MCDM-1935|getting some new allies I wrote up a cool little narrative thing you can download the doobly-doo that I then
MCDM-1936|emailed to the players to show them they're not alone I also wrote a long email to the players I basically
MCDM-1937|recapitulated the video the railroad versus a sandbox and I explained to them something I never had I had given them
MCDM-1938|all this setting material but I had never told them what kind of game do I run what am I like as a DM right now if
MCDM-1939|you're just starting out you might not know what you're like as a DM but I do I know exactly what kind of game I run I
MCDM-1940|know what kind of players I value I know what kind of scenarios I concoct and I didn't communicate any of this to the
MCDM-1941|players why not because I'm an idiot you're an imbecile because I am perfectly capable of
MCDM-1942|screwing up just like anybody else so when I finally wrote this email saying look guys I put these things in front of
MCDM-1943|you the politics of the area the various adventures I have ready and you can pick any of them up or ignore them I don't
MCDM-1944|mind but I also run the kind of game where you can get your cells in over your head you can get yourselves in
MCDM-1945|trouble I don't expect that just because I set up a combat encounter that there is a way
MCDM-1946|for you guys to solve it it's entirely possible you guys could get yourself into a situation because of the choices
MCDM-1947|you made that is suicidal in which case I would expect you to retreat or surrender and the players had never
MCDM-1948|thought about that they didn't know that because I had never told them so if you have some idea of what kind of DM you're
MCDM-1949|going to be tell your players ahead of time say this is the kind of game I run don't just say this is the campaign
MCDM-1950|setting don't just say well hear how my elves are different than D&D elves talk about who you are as a Dungeon Master
MCDM-1951|what kind of game you like running what kind of players do you value or maybe a better way of putting it is what kind of
MCDM-1952|behavior do you value in your players right I like players who are motivated who have their own ambition who want to
MCDM-1953|achieve things in the world so for instance the players have found through their own decision-making I did not put
MCDM-1954|this in front of them they found and took the shield of and room for themselves which means now if they
MCDM-1955|wanted to one of the players could declare himself king of and room and if that player has saved a lot of people
MCDM-1956|people would flock to him but again that's up to the players so I took the time to write an email to explain to
MCDM-1957|them this is the kind of game I run which I should have done months ago we sat down and talked for two hours about
MCDM-1958|what had happened I explained my point of view I explained why the bad guys behave the way they did and the players
MCDM-1959|at the end of the night ultimately thought okay well actually that was pretty epic
MCDM-1960|skoros gave His life so that the druid could escape and as a result everyone had escaped except the wizard if there
MCDM-1961|was any player at the table who was going to sacrifice his character his life so that everyone else could escape
MCDM-1962|it was Phil that's why Phil didn't cast invisibility on himself he cast it on the fighter so the fighter could get out
MCDM-1963|with the shield so they could achieve their new objective of do not let the regen get the shield of and room and he
MCDM-1964|didn't and now they've got some epic bad guys that are on their tail right I mean what a great way to introduce some bad
MCDM-1965|guys maybe there's a way to do it without sacrificing a player though so at the end of the day I don't think the
MCDM-1966|players did anything wrong I don't think they did anything stupid I do feel their choices got more and
MCDM-1967|more narrow as they went and they didn't detect that at first and once they did detect it they weren't sure what they
MCDM-1968|could do and I didn't tell him what they could do because I felt like I don't want to tell you guys what to do then
MCDM-1969|I'm kind of taking some of the fun away from you but since then I have made it a point to remind them of things they know
MCDM-1970|to remind them of their options you know the players interrogate an orc and say is there
MCDM-1971|a secret way into black spire keep in New York says no and I say well he seems to be telling the truth and the players
MCDM-1972|talk about and I have to remind them don't forget you guys know of a secret way in you found out back in the mine
MCDM-1973|from the goblins now normally I wouldn't tell my players that I would expect them to live or die on their own you know on
MCDM-1974|their wit's but again these are new players with one or two exceptions none of them have ever played D&D before so
MCDM-1975|that's the catastrophe episode lesson number one do not take agency away from your players lesson number two
MCDM-1976|communicate to your players and tell them what kind of DM you're going to be what kind of eventually are going to run
MCDM-1977|and don't be afraid to tell them what you think is likely to happen based on this scenario they've concocted don't be
MCDM-1978|afraid of failure because it's going to happen failing doesn't matter what matters is how you respond to that
MCDM-1979|failure be open to your players complaints speak openly about what you thought about your motivation about why
MCDM-1980|things went the way they did my campaign suffered well I thought for a little while might be a fatal catastrophe but
MCDM-1981|my friends and I talked about it and we got over it and we fixed it and we're still playing next time we get the other
MCDM-1982|in play which is tomorrow night the players gonna try and infiltrate broken spire keep which I think is going to be
MCDM-1983|part of the climax of this first book of the campaign they have a lot of ideas about how to lay siege to or infiltrate
MCDM-1984|broken spire keep they thought about sending the druid in disguised as a tiny animal they thought about sending the
MCDM-1985|warlock in using visibility or having the warlock cast invisibility on the Ranger or the thief so they could go in
MCDM-1986|and scout the place and get a map and find out where all the bad guys where are the prisoners but so far they've
MCDM-1987|managed to ambush and kill several different patrols and they've gotten some information about what's going on
MCDM-1988|inside to keep and they've reduced the numbers of the people in the keep a little bit and they even know about a
MCDM-1989|backdoor a secret way in but it's going to require them doubling back and that might take a while and the bad guys
MCDM-1990|might get reinforcements so I'm as excited as anybody if I know what happens next
MCDM-1991|I'm feeling a lot better by the way I'm not iron person I'm like 95% let me know what you guys want to see next as far as
MCDM-1992|episodes go I'm thinking about doing an episode on alignment I'm thinking about doing an episode on setting up cool bad
MCDM-1993|guys I still want to do an episode where we build a campaign together because I think that's the kind of thing that
MCDM-1994|makes running Dungeons & Dragons uniquely fun also of course we're gonna do episodes about prepackaged campaign
MCDM-1995|setting we'll talk about The Forgotten Realms and Grayhawk and about a bunch of other campaign settings that might be a
MCDM-1996|little more obscure but if we do build a campaign together it's probably going to be something where we get together on
MCDM-1997|Twitch and I run hexa prefer and we generate a random map and I look to the chat channel and say okay what are we
MCDM-1998|gonna call this mountain range and who lives here and tell me something interesting about this
MCDM-1999|mountain range that's a secret that the players might not know and after we've done that with all the different regions
MCDM-2000|and features we'll have a campaign map I'm on the Pacific coast so if we get together on Twitch it's probably gonna
MCDM-2001|be on the weekend it's probably gonna be around you know in the afternoon let's say noon ish so far this is like episode
MCDM-2002|16 or 17 and I've promised to do a lot of stuff in these episodes but I've forgotten most of those promises so if
MCDM-2003|you remember when I said oh we'll talk about this in a future episode let me know in the doobly-doo as always there
MCDM-2004|are no ads in this channel and I have no patreon but if you want to support the channel I encourage you to come by my
MCDM-2005|Amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo I am an independent author I write fantasy novels if you like D&D if
MCDM-2006|you like fantasy you might like them read the description read the reviews you might like them next week we talk
MCDM-2007|about well what do you want to talk about I'm as eager to find out as you are until next time peace out
MCDM-2008|well the best-laid plans of mice everybody Matt Koval here I had a plan today to record myself running D&D
MCDM-2009|Thursday night game night and before the game I recorded a short video describing what I thought was going to happen and
MCDM-2010|describing the prep that I had already done so that you get to see the map of the dungeon in my notes and meet walking
MCDM-2011|you through the process of what do I think the players are going to do and then I recorded the game of four hours
MCDM-2012|of video of me running D&D unfortunately there was no audio so rather than scrap the whole thing I mean there's a plan to
MCDM-2013|do this again in the future episode but we're going to cut after this to me just doing the setup and then instead of
MCDM-2014|watching I'm just going to recap what actually happens so you're gonna get a chance to see how I prep and what I
MCDM-2015|thought the players were going to do and then we'll talk about what actually happened it's still a useful exercise I
MCDM-2016|think so in the coming weeks we'll do it again I'll record myself describing what I think is going to happen and show you
MCDM-2017|the prep that I do before a game and then you'll get to see me running the game and then afterwards we'll talk
MCDM-2018|about how things went I really don't think there's any substitute for another DM who is starting out to see a DM do it
MCDM-2019|like I said in another video we all started with older brothers or kids in all you know grades ahead of us running
MCDM-2020|the game when we were 13 14 and 15 so we got to see it live in person and you start going I can do what that guy does
MCDM-2021|so here's me talking about what I think is going to happen Thursday night so tonight's game night at Turtle Rock
MCDM-2022|Studios this is the second group of players they are third level they are about to go into the second level of a
MCDM-2023|dungeon I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to explain how I set up how I prepare and what I think is
MCDM-2024|going to happen and then we'll have another segment after that talking about what actually happened compared to what
MCDM-2025|I thought would happen so a little bit of background this is a mine in the super module night below and if you're
MCDM-2026|familiar with night below I've mixed some of the stuff up to accommodate my players but a bunch of goblins live down
MCDM-2027|here normally and some orcs have moved in and taken over and are making the goblins do things the goblins don't want
MCDM-2028|to do so before descending into the second level of this mind the players captured one of the goblins on the first
MCDM-2029|level and after questioning him realized what the relationship between the goblins and the orcs is the goblins
MCDM-2030|don't like having the orcs as masters so the players came up with an idea we will send this goblin down to the second
MCDM-2031|level of the mine will send him to talk to their chieftain and tell the chieftain listen
MCDM-2032|we are coming we're on your side we can help you against the orcs in the final battle with the orc chieftain be on our
MCDM-2033|side betray your orc masters turn against them and I thought quite cleverly they gave this little goblin
MCDM-2034|miner a pack full of orc heads heads they chopped off the orcs they had already killed to kind of send the
MCDM-2035|message to the goblin chieftain that they were serious look we can kill orcs so that's the setup going into the
MCDM-2036|second level let's take a look at the map of the second level of the dungeon and we'll talk about what kinds of
MCDM-2037|encounters I have planned for them and how I think it's going to go it should be interesting to see the difference
MCDM-2038|between what I had planned and what actually happens for instance right now Thursday morning about 10 hours before
MCDM-2039|we play I really have no idea whether or not their plan is going to work I don't really think it should be up to me if
MCDM-2040|that makes any sense I mean I guess I could just decide but I don't want to decide I want to see what happens as the
MCDM-2041|players play through and explore the bottom level of this mine I guess it's my experience or my
MCDM-2042|instinct that enough things will happen on the way there to meet the head of the orcs in his lair with the goblin
MCDM-2043|chieftain that any ideas I might have about what might happen will at that point be thrown out there's a great
MCDM-2044|quote no plan survives contact with the enemy and in this case the enemy is just the adventure itself we're all going to
MCDM-2045|find out what happens together but I guess if I thought about it a little bit I would conclude that there should be a
MCDM-2046|chance their plan will work of course there should be a chance the plan will work it's a good plan but they
MCDM-2047|know now that goblins and orcs are not lawful creatures they are not civilized creatures they respond only to strength
MCDM-2048|so right now that one goblin I think I named him Gore bag or something a Gore Gore but Gore Gore got borghi boar gut I
MCDM-2049|think I named him Porco we'll find out anyway the Goblin anyway the Goblin that they captured he responded positively to
MCDM-2050|their interrogation because they seemed stronger than the orcs right I think that's a big part of the chaotic
MCDM-2051|alignment when it comes to gobble annoyed and non-human creatures is that it's ruled by strength so as long as the
MCDM-2052|players continue to succeed in this level of the dungeon they should be okay I think if they arrived in that final
MCDM-2053|chamber where the orc lieutenant he's not the head of all the he's just the head of the orcs in this
MCDM-2054|mind we're the orc lieutenant is where the goblin chieftain in the Goblin Shannon are and the players are beat up
MCDM-2055|if they're wounded if they've lost a player then the goblin chieftain will conclude these guys don't have what it
MCDM-2056|takes we're sticking with the orcs but that's just my high-level view of things it's my expectation that the players and
MCDM-2057|their actions will have a big impact on my idea of what will happen in the final confrontation all right so here we have
MCDM-2058|a map of the lower level of the mine and you can see the major rooms this is the hold-down which let's see we can zoom in
MCDM-2059|here this is the first area the players are going to encounter so this is area 11 this is where the players emerge when
MCDM-2060|they come down the ladder which is what this whole this ladder goes from the upper level down to here and I'm not
MCDM-2061|sure there's anything to do here in level 11 we will find out I think maybe I made some notes on the printout of the
MCDM-2062|map that I don't have but the first choice the players have is going left or going straight now there's no light down
MCDM-2063|here this was a human mine originally but the goblins took it over and now the orcs run the goblins and both goblins
MCDM-2064|and orcs have dark vision so they can see perfectly fine out to like 60 feet so it's up to the players to carry light
MCDM-2065|around them and it may be when the players descend down here into area 11 that the McDowell the goblins and the
MCDM-2066|orcs on the upper level so I think there is some expectation that the goblins and the orcs know they're coming so maybe
MCDM-2067|the orcs have set up a barricade maybe there's a cup they've set a couple of goblin archers to shoot at these guys
MCDM-2068|it's going to be an interesting encounter to see what do they find when they emerge in room 11 here we have the
MCDM-2069|blue garl cavern I don't know what garl is but this is one of the choices the players have if they go left they see
MCDM-2070|this and there's this is a hut that the miners the human miners used to use it's now in disrepair and this is going to be
MCDM-2071|an area where the orcs have the goblins mining this mineral and in the original adventure there's like a monster down
MCDM-2072|here in area 14 and this path is a you know a down down from this area to where there is
MCDM-2073|some gold glittering down here and it's all a ruse it's not meant to in the original adventure so I think I just cut
MCDM-2074|it because the players have enough to do down here so the players could go left and go
MCDM-2075|check out the blue girl cavern but there's just orcs and goblins and in fact the goblins and orcs probably won't
MCDM-2076|be mining they'll be waiting because they know the upper levels been wiped out if the players go forward they find
MCDM-2077|another abandoned Hut from the human miners where there are some tools and there might be some resources in there
MCDM-2078|maybe some weapons or something the players can use but they're pretty well armed so now the players have a little
MCDM-2079|branch here they can go forward or they can go they can go forward or they can go to the right and if they go to the
MCDM-2080|right they end up at the dome and the dome is a very shallow lake each one of these squares is 20 feet and so this
MCDM-2081|place is huge and out here it's only about I think ankle deep they can wade through it quite easily but over here
MCDM-2082|they're going to find a corpse floating in the water laying in the water I guess I should say face down and it's old and
MCDM-2083|it's rotting and I think the players have a grappling hook that they could try to throw out here and capture this
MCDM-2084|thing and drag it back to shore because if they've in the past they've discovered that bad things happen in
MCDM-2085|water and in fact if they're suspicious of this shallow water with a corpse floating out here they should be because
MCDM-2086|there's also a purple worm under the ground here in the dome and it's just it's not a full purple worm a real
MCDM-2087|purple worm would just annihilate the party it's kind of a you know I got half purp or it's a baby purple worm has
MCDM-2088|about half the hit points of a regular purple worm and it'll come out of the ground attack the players and give me a
MCDM-2089|great opportunity to use my very nicely painted purple worm miniature and it's also something that I have several
MCDM-2090|players in a group that played back in the 80s and I have several new players and so I'm deliberately kind of running
MCDM-2091|an old-school adventure with a lot of Gygax Ian naturalism in it if you don't know what
MCDM-2092|that is you can go I'll put a link in the doobly-doo below so you can check it out but it basically means that there
MCDM-2093|are different tribes of intelligent chaotic creatures down here orcs and goblins and lots of monsters and the
MCDM-2094|players might wonder how do they get along you know what's going on down here so the corpse that they have the
MCDM-2095|opportunity to recover has a pin him it's a courser pin because this is the corpse of a dead elf Ranger and the
MCDM-2096|coursers are like the Harper's in my setting they are a loose affiliation a kind of secret society of chaotic good
MCDM-2097|mostly rangers and druids chaotic good heroes who try to stop all the evil stuff in the wilderness from
MCDM-2098|taking over and there's an elf ranger in the party one of the players is playing an elf ranger and so recovering this
MCDM-2099|corpse and getting a courser pin is an opportunity for him to a learn about the coursers and be maybe decide that he'd
MCDM-2100|be interested in joining those guys and I'm going to keep this pin and hang on to it so that if we meet one of these
MCDM-2101|guys later on I can be like hey I've got one of your pins so that's the dome and after they go through fairyland which
MCDM-2102|I'm not even really sure what is I think it's just the description I think the walls here are opalescent so it gives it
MCDM-2103|a kind of weird fairy like Sheen to it they have another choice now they go left or right and if they go right the
MCDM-2104|end of it the crab pedals I have no idea why it's called that these are all the names that the humans who ran this mine
MCDM-2105|originally gave it and here in the crab pedals the players are going to meet you can see the text over here I have note
MCDM-2106|you can stop the video if you want pause it and read this there's a bunch of corpses in here this is where the orcs
MCDM-2107|that run this mine now they take all the slaves and prisoners they capture in the world above they bring them down here
MCDM-2108|and any spell casters are taken below spell casters go down too you can see there's like a secret door here at a
MCDM-2109|path leading downward to who knows what but that's where all the spell casters go including the druid the master druid
MCDM-2110|that one of the players is looking for everyone else who's not a spell caster is basically thrown in this pit and left
MCDM-2111|to die and so there's a whole pile of corpses here and amongst the pile of corpses is of course a carrion crawler
MCDM-2112|carrying crawlers are awesome classic D&D bad guys again that 1980s feel and in and amongst the corpses there's
MCDM-2113|someone still alive a dwarf zouk are the fleet and he was a slaver so he has a pair of manacles twisted around his neck
MCDM-2114|the orcs kind of in a black humor sense have throttled this dwarf with the chains that he used to make money in the
MCDM-2115|world above it in my setting dwarf our slavers because that's the bargain they made with the invincible overlord
MCDM-2116|the invincible overlord said if you want your freedom if you want to be left alone to run your dwarf civilization the
MCDM-2117|way you want all you have to do is give me slaves that's the tithe they give to the invincible overlord to buy their
MCDM-2118|independence quote unquote and so this dwarf actually has a message to say like look that bargain the
MCDM-2119|bargain our Thane made with the invincible overlord has been subverted right the orcs are taking our cow are
MCDM-2120|using us they're capturing us they're grabbing our slaves they're they're grabbing us and they're bringing them
MCDM-2121|below and any spellcasters disappear and everyone else is killed this is an opportunity for the dwarf player who is
MCDM-2122|super engaged with a game but hasn't really yet found like a purpose a thing to do a way to engage with the meta plot
MCDM-2123|other than dwarvish greed this is an opportunity for him now to have a message he now knows something about the
MCDM-2124|bargain between the dwarves and the overlord is that there's some other entity that has inserted itself in
MCDM-2125|between there and now the dwarves who were working kind of like reluctantly for like a lawful evil bad guy are now
MCDM-2126|finding themselves you know in the pay of monsters and this is a dramatic moment that may not make any literal
MCDM-2127|sense by the rules because though car the fleet is going to deliver his message and then die because I think
MCDM-2128|that's a dramatic moment and it happens in movies and books and narratives all the time is these are his dying words
MCDM-2129|and there's no rule for that that's something I've made up because I think it suits the narrative and some of the
MCDM-2130|players will get it they'll go oh that's cool but other players are gonna be frustrated they're gonna say I don't
MCDM-2131|understand why we can't save this guy he's awake and talking and I'm just have to explain these are his dying words he
MCDM-2132|is beyond help that it's a special narrative condition that exists outside the strict rules of fifth edition D&D
MCDM-2133|and you listening to this may think well that's not fair but this is the power the DM has it's up to me to decide where
MCDM-2134|do I put that needle between storytelling and pure game mechanics now traditionally that needle pegs pretty
MCDM-2135|far to the left of the game mechanic side but in this case I'm moving a little bit more toward the center and
MCDM-2136|doing some narrative stuff so they fight the carrying crawler they meet the zouk are the fleet just in time to hear his
MCDM-2137|last words then they get the chance to go to the chamber of all hearing gods again the players don't even know these
MCDM-2138|names because the humans that ran this place they are long gone and this chamber you can see again it's
MCDM-2139|20 feet on a side so this chamber is huge and this is where all the goblins live this is where the female and the
MCDM-2140|children goblins are so this is an opportunity for the players to see how the goblins have been treated by the
MCDM-2141|orcs and the fact that they're miserable so this is an opportunity for the players to feel a little bit of sympathy
MCDM-2142|or empathy for these goblins they already like the goblins because the one they captured was this little
MCDM-2143|megalomaniacal creature who wants to take over the world but his little tiny guy with no power they're like oh he's
MCDM-2144|so cute so hopefully this gives the players a little bit of a more motivation to be on the goblins side
MCDM-2145|before they get to the Grand cabin here in the cavern is the chieftain of the blue-skinned tribe and his shaman they
MCDM-2146|have already heard about these guys there's what the shaman has prepared the chief does a potion of growth this is
MCDM-2147|gonna be the first encounter in the entire campaign where the bad guys have magic the bad guys have spells and magic
MCDM-2148|items and of course the bad guys use of the magic items they have the players aren't gonna like that they're gonna
MCDM-2149|wait a minute we want that potion that's our treasure but of course if the bad guys have treasure that they can use I
MCDM-2150|think they would and of course there's the orc lieutenant he's not the head of the broken skull orcs that's bone break
MCDM-2151|or Doric or but he's got he sent his lieutenant down here to run these goblins and he has a potion of stone
MCDM-2152|giant strength that he's going to drink at half hit points and that man I I'm telling you that now but by the time the
MCDM-2153|players get to the Grand have urn I may decide whoa that is bad news the players are not strong enough to fight bad guys
MCDM-2154|with all this cool stuff in fact I may have to put some treasure down here yeah you know probably at lunch today
MCDM-2155|I'll stop take a break and put some treasure down here so the players have something they can use in the battle in
MCDM-2156|the grand cavern maybe the goblins in the chamber of all-hearing gods the these goblins here the female goblins
MCDM-2157|and the child goblins have heard that these heroes are coming and they have secreted away from the orcs some magic
MCDM-2158|items that they can't use maybe out maybe an axe or something but they give to the heroes so that the heroes have
MCDM-2159|some cool weapons to use or at least maybe some consumable magic items in the Grand cavern and if they defeat the bad
MCDM-2160|guys here in the grand Cameron and regardless of what the goblins have done they'll get some treasure and they will
MCDM-2161|find a letter I will try our printed out and kind of crumpled up that is from the human who's kind of
MCDM-2162|masterminding this whole thing and even that human is only a pawn in a much larger story who has sent a letter to
MCDM-2163|bone breaker Dora core and this letter basically says hey the wizard that the heroes have been relying on you know how
MCDM-2164|there's the druid player and he has this druid master well there's a wizard player and there's a high-level wizard
MCDM-2165|that he likes and has been relying on the orcs are like go get that dude so when the players leave this area and
MCDM-2166|they leave the mines and they go back up to the world above and they go try to talk to this high-level wizard NPC who's
MCDM-2167|kind of been helping them out they will discover that he is gone and there's a whole human politics subplot that the
MCDM-2168|heroes are going to get involved in so that is my plan for this adventure it's relatively straightforward we just have
MCDM-2169|some goblins and orcs in here we have a purple worm in the dome we have a carrion crawler in the crab pedals we
MCDM-2170|have some NPC goblins or non-combatants here in the chamber while hearing gods and may be the last opportunity for the
MCDM-2171|players to kind of gear up and get ready before the final battle in the grand cavern and the final battle is the Oh
MCDM-2172|lieutenant the a goblin shaman a goblin chieftain and however many orcs and goblins I think is sufficient for a six
MCDM-2173|level party at this point I'm sorry for six third level characters at this point okay so that's what I thought was going
MCDM-2174|to happen I thought the players were gonna explore the mines I thought they were gonna find
MCDM-2175|the dead core sir I thought they were going to talk to the dying dwarf and I thought they would confront the orc
MCDM-2176|lieutenant and his goblin thralls so what actually happened well I told you that I hadn't decided whether or not the
MCDM-2177|Goblin gambit was going to pay off I like leaving that stuff to the last moment I don't want to make plans too
MCDM-2178|early because if I decide something is super cool this is a cool idea early on in the week or before the game then it
MCDM-2179|becomes more solidified it becomes more real it becomes harder for me to feel comfortable deviating from it later I
MCDM-2180|mean I had a framework right we had the lower level of the mines and we had the central conflict the heroes versus the
MCDM-2181|orcs and we knew that there was a subplot with the orcs versus the goblins so I actually knew quite
MCDM-2182|a lot about what was going to happen once the players went down that ladder but I left myself open to possibility
MCDM-2183|over the rest of the week so only a few hours before the game started I had an idea I like to kind of yes but
MCDM-2184|storytelling where the players get what they want and things kind of went the way they thought but there was an
MCDM-2185|unforeseen consequence and that's great kind of Pulp adventure storytelling you know Indiana Jones successfully leaps
MCDM-2186|onto the truck carrying the ark but he slips and now he's hanging by his fingernails so he got what he wanted
MCDM-2187|he's on the truck but things didn't go exactly according to plan so the plan was to send a goblin down to the lower
MCDM-2188|level to communicate with the Goblin shaman which is I think in the players terminology the head of the goblins
MCDM-2189|really it's a goblin chieftain and say listen there are some heroes upstairs who can beat the orcs if we side with
MCDM-2190|them in the final conflict then we will be free of our orc masters and I decided that worked boar got the Goblin that
MCDM-2191|they talked to boar gut successfully communicated this idea to the goblin chieftain and the goblin chieftain was
MCDM-2192|prepared to side with the heroes in the final conflict but off-screen unbeknownst to the heroes I decided that
MCDM-2193|the orcs found out about this and punished them so this created an interesting moment because it's very
MCDM-2194|beginning of the session picking up where we left off last the players are standing around this five foot hole with
MCDM-2195|a iron ladder bolted into it that goes down to the lower level of the mine and they're trying to figure out how do we
MCDM-2196|go down there but I mean should we go single file like should we all go at once should we send the the Ranger down
MCDM-2197|there to scout and see what's down there are they aware of us they must be aware of us we just killed a whole bunch of
MCDM-2198|orcs up here are they gonna ambush us when they get down there they wanted to find a way to get down to the lower
MCDM-2199|level without exposing any weakness that's typical of the players they want to advance they want to make progress
MCDM-2200|but they want to expose themselves to as little risk as possible and of course D&D is all about risk so that's
MCDM-2201|ultimately a fruitless endeavor it is my job to make sure that their plans work sorta if their plans never worked they
MCDM-2202|would get really frustrated and if their plans always work flawlessly they would get really bored so this is an example
MCDM-2203|of that as they're debating what do we do they start to hear the sounds of battle below that's the first hint that
MCDM-2204|things are not going according to plan so now suddenly motivated they quickly descend the ladder see problem solved
MCDM-2205|what had been a scenario where the players were debating and arguing about what to do instantly became we know what
MCDM-2206|to do go down the ladder quick our goblin allies are being slaughtered you know I like when I design an adventure
MCDM-2207|or really when I an adventure to make sure that regardless of where the players go
MCDM-2208|something interesting is going to happen either a combat encounter that furthers the plot or a combat encounter that
MCDM-2209|doesn't really further the plot but is super interesting like the purple worm or a black pudding or a carrion crawler
MCDM-2210|or some kind of interesting role-playing encounter like a dying dwarf or a clue to some other events happening in the
MCDM-2211|campaign like the coursers and largely I've done that because most of the time in the 80's and 90's when I was playing
MCDM-2212|the players regardless of who I was playing with they always had kind of the same attitude which is follow the left
MCDM-2213|wall follow the left wall is kind of a way of solving getting lost in the dungeon and not knowing how we explored
MCDM-2214|everything no you just pick one of the walls of the dungeon and you follow it along and you open every door and you
MCDM-2215|search for secret doors you go down every corridor so that by the time you ultimately come back to the entrance you
MCDM-2216|know we have explored everything the players I'm used to playing with are used to exploring everything as the rule
MCDM-2217|but recently in the past couple of years I've noticed that I think things become a little bit more plot driven now and if
MCDM-2218|the players know their objective they will go to the objective they will if they have a choice left or right and
MCDM-2219|they know that left is where the orc lieutenant is that runs the mines they're going to go left even if right
MCDM-2220|has something really interesting down it so that's something I hadn't counted on the players basically made a beeline for
MCDM-2221|the orc lieutenant and the final fight at the end they skip the first branch which at that point had been orcs you
MCDM-2222|know commanding goblin miners but it turned into a slaughter where all the goblins were dead and the orcs had
MCDM-2223|retreated once I realized that the players were not going to go down the first branch and not going to see the
MCDM-2224|orcs who had just slaughtered a bunch of goblins I decided well I still want there to be an encounter down here at
MCDM-2225|this point now on the actual map in front of the players as they go forward there is a little Hut on the map the hut
MCDM-2226|that the foreman used to use back when this was a human mind so there's a little building in the middle of this
MCDM-2227|dungeon these are these corridors are huge like one square on that map is 20 feet so I decided that since the players
MCDM-2228|were skipping the first branch I would kind of move the first branch in front of them instead of coming upon the orcs
MCDM-2229|having just killed all the Goblin miners because they betrayed the orcs the orcs decided to retreat to the hut and use
MCDM-2230|the hut as cover and shoot the heroes with arrows as they came up the mine and that work that was an interesting
MCDM-2231|encounter but then the players just went straight forward there was the branch that led to the pool with the
MCDM-2232|dead courser in the purple worm the players never went down there they didn't even explore they just kept going
MCDM-2233|straight and they had heard the sounds of battle echoing from up ahead the battle was persistent but they couldn't
MCDM-2234|really catch up to it and that's what they were trying to do they were trying to catch up to where is the next battle
MCDM-2235|between the orcs and goblins because I think they were trying to save the goblins so I made sure the sounds of
MCDM-2236|battle died down to give them a little bit of release from the tension of the clock ticking like can we stop this from
MCDM-2237|happening once they heard the sounds of battle died down they started to realize whatever had been happening was now over
MCDM-2238|and that made them a little bit more cautious a little bit more interested in exploring so that's two branches they'd
MCDM-2239|ignore they had ignored the first branch with the orcs you know running the Goblin miners they ignore the second
MCDM-2240|branch with the dead courser and the purple worm and now we're at the last branch so now they're presented with a
MCDM-2241|choice left and right it's no longer forward or a branch it's now a fork many of these players are new players and
MCDM-2242|none of these players have played before this is the first time I mean this is our fourth session but as a group in a
MCDM-2243|campaign this is a new team so they haven't developed a lot of the kind of standard operating procedure that other
MCDM-2244|groups have and they spent a little while trying to come up with some reason to pick left or right they look for
MCDM-2245|tracks they didn't find any tracks they listened they didn't hear anything they tested the air was there air current
MCDM-2246|coming from one of the other they were desperate to find some piece of information that would lead them to
MCDM-2247|making the right decision and after about a half hour of analysis paralysis I just suggested and this is very
MCDM-2248|unusual for me typically I let the players work out what they want to do but I said listen all the other times I
MCDM-2249|run D and D the heroes send a thief or Ranger ahead to scout that's what those guys are for and after I suggested that
MCDM-2250|there were like oh yeah that's a good idea so I guess that's another lesson is don't be afraid to suggest things to
MCDM-2251|your players on the other hand be afraid to suggest things to your players because it's very difficult for the DM
MCDM-2252|to suggest a course of action in a neutral way if you tell the players they can do something just out of the blue if
MCDM-2253|you just say hey you know you guys could try this they will think they will suspect that you're telling them that
MCDM-2254|for a reason it won't sound like the suggestion coming from another player so I work very hard to say look all I'm
MCDM-2255|saying is of the many other groups I run D&D for this is typical send the Ranger down there send the thief down there
MCDM-2256|send some stealthy send somebody who can see in the dark to have an elf Ranger they
MCDM-2257|nominated him so the elf Ranger did his job he went down one corridor and he saw the pile of bodies he saw there was a
MCDM-2258|dead end he didn't investigate the pile of bodies once he was relatively sure that there
MCDM-2259|wasn't a way out of this branch he you know retraced his steps and went and told the players what he saw and that
MCDM-2260|was fun actually because for the first time with this group I took the player outside the room and we talked about
MCDM-2261|what he saw it was then up to him to come back and relay what he saw in his own words so it didn't seem as though
MCDM-2262|there was anything down that branch that was very important they never investigated the corpses so they went
MCDM-2263|down the other branch the Ranger snuck ahead and he found the goblin bivouac the place where the goblins live what's
MCDM-2264|going on we're only too big way and they sleep and he saw that there had been a slaughter here there were still female
MCDM-2265|goblins there were still children goblins being protected by their mothers but there were male goblins slaughtered
MCDM-2266|all over the place weapons laid by the bodies and of course the Ranger was curious is Bourget here
MCDM-2267|is our goblin buddy here and I asked are you gonna check are you gonna give the female goblins a chance to see you
MCDM-2268|because at this point he's hiding he's just scouting things out he said no I'll go back to the party and
MCDM-2269|tell him what I saw which he did and they're like okay well there's nothing down one corridor let's go down the
MCDM-2270|other corridor and as a result they never saw the dwarf and that sucked I liked that encounter I wanted the dwarf
MCDM-2271|player to meet a dying dwarf and find out that the bargain their Thane had made with the overlord had been
MCDM-2272|subverted but them's the breaks you know I didn't want to force it to happen again I want the game to feel plausible
MCDM-2273|realistic verisimilitude so the players enter the goblin bivouac and they talked to the Goblin females and they find out
MCDM-2274|what happened now the goblins are terrified because they've already watched their menfolk
MCDM-2275|slaughtered and now these humans show up and start asking them questions and so the goblins didn't really give them any
MCDM-2276|answers they just huddled and pointed to the only way out and the heroes realized okay that way is where the orc
MCDM-2277|lieutenant is and any remaining goblins like hopefully maybe the Goblin and shaman in the goblin chieftain and the
MCDM-2278|cave narrows to a five foot wide corridor and they have to go single file and there was no real reason for either
MCDM-2279|side to have surprise on the other so then we had an epic battle in the final room it was the orc lieutenant and I
MCDM-2280|think six other orcs and the goblin chieftain in the Goblin shamon now the combat was actually very interesting a
MCDM-2281|lot of really cool things happen but for the purposes of this video what we're curious about is did the Goblin gambit
MCDM-2282|pay off the players walk into the room in time to see the orc lieutenant with his axe at the throat of the goblin
MCDM-2283|chieftain and he says to him in goblin which only one player understands another betrayal like this and it's the
MCDM-2284|end of the blue skinned tribe except I said it with Turkish accent I have a little bit of a cold right now and my
MCDM-2285|throat is sore so I'm not going to do it then the heroes enter in its combat and the players are constantly watching the
MCDM-2286|goblin chieftain the goblin shaman whose side are they on now it's clear these two goblins are not happy working for
MCDM-2287|the orcs and they're looking at each other trying to figure out what to do now they watched as the goblin chieftain
MCDM-2288|drank a potion of growth and the orc chieftain drank a potion of stone giant strength and this was the first time the
MCDM-2289|heroes had encountered a combat where the bad guys were using magic items so that made it notable and interesting and
MCDM-2290|in the first round of combat the goblin chieftain did nothing but the Goblin shaman cast entangle on the heroes so
MCDM-2291|right out of the gate it wasn't clear whose side the goblins were on the goblin chieftain did nothing that's good
MCDM-2292|but the goblins shamon cast entangle on us but entangle doesn't do any damage and it didn't really stop us from doing
MCDM-2293|what to do it was a minor inconvenience so it started to look to the players as though the opportunity was still there
MCDM-2294|for them to turn the goblins into allies oh and I made sure they saw that boar guts body the Goblin buddy that they had
MCDM-2295|met and talked to had been eviscerated and slaughtered his entrails were on the floor and the bag of orc heads was lying
MCDM-2296|there empty and the orc heads were scattered around and they were actually a little bit upset that Bourget died
MCDM-2297|because they liked that goblin they thought he was their buddy and he was kind of cute in a kind of sociopathic
MCDM-2298|megalomaniacal way and I think it did really motivate them to want to help the goblins more the whole scenario
MCDM-2299|everything that had happened on the lower level fed into their desire to help the goblins out and free them from
MCDM-2300|slavery under the orcs now the orc lieutenant charges into combat and because of his great accent because he's
MCDM-2301|a badass orc and because of the potion of stone giant strengths he attacks of the wounded druid player and fells him
MCDM-2302|in one blow that was bad news the other orcs throw their javelins and take down the dwarf cleric now that's two of the
MCDM-2303|six heroes down and things are looking bad the players attack and they shout for Bourget in Goblin because they want
MCDM-2304|the goblin chieftain to know they're on his side that stuff works on me as a DM if you as a player come up with little
MCDM-2305|role-playing touches little situational negotiation tricks I like that and it makes it more likely your plan is going
MCDM-2306|to succeed now it was the Goblin turn and I looked at the battlefield and I noticed something interesting had
MCDM-2307|happened the orcs had charged the players and we're now fighting the players using javelins and the orc
MCDM-2308|chieftain was in melee but the goblins were back here so from the goblins point of view they could do what they wanted
MCDM-2309|and the orcs would not see them so I looked at what spells goblins shaman had memorized and the Goblin shaman had
MCDM-2310|healing word memorized now healing word doesn't do a lot of healing but it is at range so I formulated an idea on the
MCDM-2311|spot I had the Goblin shaman cast healing ward on the Fallen druid as a result the Fallen druid was able to get
MCDM-2312|up cast healing on the door if the door was able to get up and now everybody in the party was up it was the Wizards turn
MCDM-2313|and the wizard player cast whole person on the orc chieftain now whole person if it's successful will paralyze the orc
MCDM-2314|chieftain and there is nothing he can do until his next round all attacks against the orc chieftain get advantage all
MCDM-2315|damage is automatically a critical so I rolled in front of the players to see does the orc chieftain save against
MCDM-2316|whole person it's a wisdom saving throw and wisdom is his worst stat he's at minus 1 the DC
MCDM-2317|was 13 which means he needed a 14 to save I rolled my 20 sided die in front of the players and rolled a 9 the
MCDM-2318|players cheered they literally cheered they saw him freeze in place and mid attack and give the universal symbol for
MCDM-2319|I am frozen Oriol can well Ken what and then I described the goblin chieftain as
MCDM-2320|pointing to the orc lieutenant his eyes wide as though this is it this is our chance and from then on the battle went
MCDM-2321|pretty much as you would expect the Goblin shaman cast bein on the orcs it cast bless on the heroes the players got
MCDM-2322|basically a round and a half of free critical attacks on the orc lieutenant he survived he managed to make it to the
MCDM-2323|end of his next round where he finally made his saving throw against the whole person spell he shook off the effects
MCDM-2324|but that saving throw happens at the end of his turn and he didn't see another turn so the heroes killed all the orcs
MCDM-2325|they killed the orc lieutenant and they got to finally talk to the goblins and that was fun there was lot of
MCDM-2326|negotiation with the goblins regarding you know what they had been doing for the orcs and at the end of that process
MCDM-2327|the druid player whose Swamp is nearby had some goblin allies which you know their goblins who knows how long that
MCDM-2328|will last but it was a great encounter there was an interesting combat and a lot of cool role-playing back and forth
MCDM-2329|between the heroes and the goblins and even though it didn't go exactly as I imagined it was pretty cool and now it's
MCDM-2330|up to me to determine is there another place and a further adventure where the players can meet a dying to
MCDM-2331|or for find the body of a dead courser and I am sure I will find uses for those encounters it's all grist for the mill
MCDM-2332|everything the players don't encounter in this adventure I can recycle for another adventure once you've done the
MCDM-2333|work for an encounter or an adventure or an NPC or scenario you can use it anywhere that's the great thing about
MCDM-2334|D&D prep work is even if the players don't encounter what you had ready this time you can use it again later lastly
MCDM-2335|before we go we're coming up on ten episodes of running the game and it's my hope that we can do this forever I have
MCDM-2336|no plans to turn on monetization you shouldn't be seeing ads in front of these videos I think a patreon will be
MCDM-2337|somewhat elaborate for a channel like this but if you're interested in supporting the channel there is
MCDM-2338|something you can do I am in my spare time and indie fantasy novelist and I've got a couple books up on Amazon if you
MCDM-2339|play D&D if you're interested in fantasy I think you would probably like them you should be able to see links to them here
MCDM-2340|and here you can check them out if you want they're pretty well reviewed and you can download a sample for free
MCDM-2341|they're only on Kindle they're only four bucks if you read the reviews and go that seems interesting give them a shot
MCDM-2342|if you check it out you like it or even if you check it out you didn't like it let me know what you thought it's an
MCDM-2343|attempt on my part to write a kind of epic getting the team together story so if you like D&D you may like it next
MCDM-2344|episode we'll talk about using the DM screen about rolling in front of the players about rolling behind the screen
MCDM-2345|about fudging roles when you should do it if you should do it see you next time peace out
MCDM-2346|everybody Matt Koval here it is late after game night it's 12:45 in the morning I don't know if you can tell
MCDM-2347|there's a little bit of a frog in my throat I've been sick and I was at work all day and then running D&D all night I
MCDM-2348|tweeted a few minutes ago saying that I think I can say without fear of hyperbole that a single encounter with a
MCDM-2349|black pudding as irrevocably changed the geopolitical landscape of my D&D game and people on Twitter were demanding
MCDM-2350|explanations and I couldn't think of a way to explain it in a tweet so I thought hell I'll just make a short
MCDM-2351|video and kind of catch people up so if you're expecting another 30-minute long Matt Koval teaches you had to run D&D
MCDM-2352|video I apologize this will go up before Monday it'll probably go up tonight if I can get it edited quickly enough and if
MCDM-2353|you were following the last video it picks up basically where that one left off the heroes had settled their issues
MCDM-2354|with the goblins and the mind and freed the goblins from the orc masters who had been wood enslaved them and had decided
MCDM-2355|to rest up all week I've been probing and prodding them trying to get them to tell me what do you guys gonna do next
MCDM-2356|they're at a mine in the middle of a slump as I saw it they had two options they could either go to nearby ruined
MCDM-2357|keep where they know there's a bunch of bad guys orcs who have been capturing spellcasters and sending them below they
MCDM-2358|don't know exactly - who the wordless ones the voiceless stalkers the goblins said and when pressed the goblins
MCDM-2359|terrified and refusing to say more just I described them as pressing their wrists to their lips and wiggling their
MCDM-2360|fingers so the some of the players our experienced Dungeons and Dragons ears and they know what that means but
MCDM-2361|other players are sort of mystified so the players have reason to believe if they go to black spire keep that they'll
MCDM-2362|learn more about who's kidnapping these spell casters but there's also the nearby city the betta gar keep there in
MCDM-2363|the barony of betta guard they've been to several towns in betta gar they saved all the town's folk in Greivis furred
MCDM-2364|but they've never been to the seat of the barony they've never met the the Regent they have met the Barons wizard
MCDM-2365|and the Barons wizard is a good guy he they've been somebody they've been relying on but
MCDM-2366|they found a note with the orcs down in the Goblin mine and the note with very suspiciously described someone who
MCDM-2367|looked just like the wizard I'll put the note up so you can check it out and the players are like oh man they're
MCDM-2368|they're going after spell casters and now they're going after our wizard patron the one guy we can trust his
MCDM-2369|names tastes which is Latin for hush all the Wizards in my campaign setting take on Latin names because if you know their
MCDM-2370|true name you have power over them and their spells don't work as well on you so the heroes are afraid the bad guys
MCDM-2371|are going after taste and they're not sure what to do do we go to the city or do we go to black spire keep but it
MCDM-2372|seems as though black spire keep us where all the actions happening so that seemed to be the consensus before
MCDM-2373|tonight but after resting they decided hey let's go back into these mines and explore the stuff that we didn't check
MCDM-2374|out last time and that caused a lot of debate is there any reason to believe there's anything there to explore why
MCDM-2375|are we wasting time here other players like me but there's some treasure maybe there's some plot points that we missed
MCDM-2376|so the faction that want to go back into the mine talked the other faction who are like it's a waste of time into
MCDM-2377|giving it a shot and in fact they only missed one encounter on the first level of the mine there was a dead end that
MCDM-2378|their goblin buddy that they had kind of kidnapped and then negotiated with said if you guys need a place to rest there's
MCDM-2379|a dead end there in the mind that nobody ever goes down to so the players explored it and it turned out that the
MCDM-2380|reason that no one ever goes down there is there's a black pudding attached to the ceiling and of course the players
MCDM-2381|have a half-orc fighter and a doorman cleric in front of the party the ranger and thief who might be able to detect
MCDM-2382|these things are safely tucked away in the back they're not searching they're not being stealthy they're just moving
MCDM-2383|forward in anticipation of adventure and of course aventure found them so I don't know how much you know about black
MCDM-2384|puddings but they are made of acid and when they attack you bad things happen in this case the Dwarven cleric who is
MCDM-2385|wearing a heavy metal armor and has a heavy two-handed metal Maul is attacked by the black pudding and as a result the
MCDM-2386|acid that hits him from the black pudding corrodes his metal armor his armor class goes down by one permanently
MCDM-2387|he attacks the black pudding with his mall the mall takes damage from the acid now the malls damage is reduced by one
MCDM-2388|permanent and at that point the dwarf player said we are going to better our keep I am
MCDM-2389|buying better armor so that was the fork in the road down one road was black spire keep fighting orcs finding out
MCDM-2390|more clues to whose kidnapping wizards and the other fork was go to Boettiger keep they have never been to the seat of
MCDM-2391|the barony they have never talked to the regent they don't know why there why is there a regent why isn't there a baron
MCDM-2392|they don't know and so they decide to head on down there and their journey there is uneventful but once they arrive
MCDM-2393|everything goes wrong I tried to suddenly suggest to the thief player that maybe he should to go to the inn
MCDM-2394|and do some you know investigation to find out what's going on in town I asked the dwarf if you want to go see the
MCDM-2395|blacksmith and he said yeah and initially the druid was going to go with him but then the druid said no we all
MCDM-2396|want to go meet the wizard tastes the guy that is our buddy and make sure he's okay and tell him
MCDM-2397|what we found we have magic items form to identify we have news about the kidnappings in the area unfortunately
MCDM-2398|everybody in the party except for the dwarf Keck the dwarf cleric of Ord the dwarf and God in my setting or it goes
MCDM-2399|to talk to the blacksmith everyone else goes to talk to the wizard they knock on the Wizards door and a knight opens the
MCDM-2400|door and says who are you and very suspicious things happen the heroes say we are friends of taste the wizard
MCDM-2401|he's the Barons wizard and this is the seat of the barony we're his buddies we should be welcomed and the knight is
MCDM-2402|like oh when was the last time you saw chase and the heroes say whoa a week ago and they're like oh so you may be the
MCDM-2403|last people who saw taste alive would you mind automatically the players are like what is going on would you mind
MCDM-2404|coming and talking to the Regent he would very much like to talk to you and the players are like yeah sure of course
MCDM-2405|and as they are led to the Regent more Knights join them and now they have an escort and these Knights seem like
MCDM-2406|serious guys like not necessarily normal men and arms guys that might be higher level than the party and eventually they
MCDM-2407|get an audience with the Regent and while they are waiting the druid player starts to wonder I think we're being set
MCDM-2408|up and it becomes clear to the druid player becomes clear to the thief player the things are not what they seem and at
MCDM-2409|this point the Knights start to get a little bit you know aggressive and no you may not use the
MCDM-2410|privy no man uses the privy while waiting for the Baron or the regent and then they have an audience with the
MCDM-2411|regions in the Regent is a bad-looking dude and he's got is a cleric there with him and now there's five Knights of the
MCDM-2412|Black Rose in the audience chamber surrounding the heroes and the Baron starts asking some very leading
MCDM-2413|questions very accusatory and it's clear he's not super interested in what the players story is he's going to hang the
MCDM-2414|disappearance of tastes on them and then hang them and the players are like whoa what is going on and the wizard says
MCDM-2415|wait wait we have a note here that we captured from the bad guys explicitly saying they're gonna go after taste and
MCDM-2416|the Baron says or I'm sorry the Regent says hey may I see that note and they're like yeah sure and the Regent looks at
MCDM-2417|the note and then rips it up and says arrest those men and I think he actually explicitly said the people will be happy
MCDM-2418|to know that we have settled the issue with taste and they will accept our explanation the ruse has been dropped
MCDM-2419|the The Regent is no longer interested in fooling these people he's like yeah you guys are gonna hang for the death of
MCDM-2420|our missing wizard so it's now one o'clock in the morning and I've just explained what's going on and I'm very
MCDM-2421|tired and I'm still recovering from a cold so I apologize if this wasn't very coherent but we left it with five of the
MCDM-2422|six heroes in the audience chamber surrounded by the Regents knights with the Regent there and he is a he looks
MCDM-2423|like he is a powerful dude the region's priest is there and they said arrest those men and then we stopped because I
MCDM-2424|said if you guys are gonna fight these guys and it looked like they were gonna go for it then that's gonna take more
MCDM-2425|time than we have tonight so this is a good place to stop meanwhile the dwarf is out in town he's talking to the
MCDM-2426|blacksmith he's fine he had his own role-playing encounter and he has his own perspective on these events and I
MCDM-2427|took him outside and role played everything with him by himself and then he came back and very studious Lee kept
MCDM-2428|his mouth shut so none of the players know what happened to him and neither do you
MCDM-2429|and neither will they until next week but I don't even know what's gonna happen
MCDM-2430|I think they're gonna try and put up a fight I think the heroes are gonna try and resist and I'm not going to tell you
MCDM-2431|how badass those Knights are but it might be suicide so because of a black pudding encounter the
MCDM-2432|dwarfs armor and weapons became corroded and because the dwarfs armor and weapons became corroded he decided we are very
MCDM-2433|definitely going to the big city nearby because I need heavy armor and that stuff's expensive and they don't have it
MCDM-2434|in the little towns so it didn't go to black spire keep they went to the big town and at the big town they wanted to
MCDM-2435|talk to the wizard anyway get their items identified let them know the bad guys were after him say we have clues as
MCDM-2436|to why spell casters are being kidnapped but unfortunately all their plans went awry they didn't go to the inn to do any
MCDM-2437|kind of gather information I don't think I mean these are these players a lot of them are new a lot of the things I
MCDM-2438|assume this is a lesson to DMS I mean or at least to me I mean you may be obvious to you but many of these guys are new
MCDM-2439|players and the things I take for granted they don't and I often try to avoid giving them leading ideas I just
MCDM-2440|ask are you guys going to do this are you guys gonna do that and you know often there are reasons I'm asking these
MCDM-2441|things but they don't know and I don't want to make it obvious because I'm very good obvious and all of a sudden it's
MCDM-2442|like you know I've given them a clue so probably this time next week I'll do another short video let you guys know
MCDM-2443|what happened but yeah one black pudding and now the heroes are embroiled in a huge political thing that they didn't
MCDM-2444|even know existed and what happened to the Baron who's supposed to be in charge and why is there a regent and why does
MCDM-2445|he seem like a bad guy and we liked the wizard and now he's gone and we've been accused of murdering him that's
MCDM-2446|ridiculous but we may hang in the morning before the people of the town never get to hear our case and they're
MCDM-2447|just gonna assume that the Regent was right and that he found the bad guys and they were us and now we're dead I have a
MCDM-2448|sneaking suspicion the hero's gonna find a way out of this but I actually have no idea what it is I'm often as surprised
MCDM-2449|as anybody to find out what their plan are their scheme is but what I've noticed is the things often get really
MCDM-2450|bad before they get good so I love black puddings fantastic all right folks thanks for watching we
MCDM-2451|will continue with our regularly scheduled program there'll be a new video on Monday we'll be talking about
MCDM-2452|DM screens and I think they'll be a video on Thursday about the deck of many things I had a lot of questions about
MCDM-2453|why I would put such a thing in my game and so we're gonna talk about how I use magic items like that and what the deck
MCDM-2454|is in its history and my plan for how to deploy it in a way that makes it a little less ridiculous see you guys
MCDM-2455|Monday peace out  
MCDM-2456|everybody Matt Koval here so we played D&D last week and for those of you who have been following my campaign we're
MCDM-2457|gonna talk about what happened and pick up the story but those of you who don't follow my campaign I think this is going
MCDM-2458|to be an interesting video if only for the first subject which is introducing new characters because the person
MCDM-2459|happened in the campaign since the last time we met was my friend Phil after having gotten his character executed
MCDM-2460|kind of in a narrative moment he made a new character he made a warlock named graves and he wrote a really cool
MCDM-2461|backstory for it I may include it I'll ask him for permission but if I eventually get permission from him I'll
MCDM-2462|include it in the doobly-doo down below and he really made an effort and did a really great job to tie his character in
MCDM-2463|with all the stuff going on in the world so it's relevant to him so that makes him different than a lot of characters
MCDM-2464|that are playing in the thursday night group is that they're kind of a band of mercenaries and they're doing the right
MCDM-2465|thing sort of out of inertia but they haven't really experienced a moment of crisis that forces them to make a
MCDM-2466|decision about if they're going to be good or evil stay tuned in other words they're doing the right thing because
MCDM-2467|it's the adventure in front of them and it's the most reasonable thing to do but there is a sense at least on my part
MCDM-2468|that some of these characters are more morally ambiguous and they're just going along with it for why not so Phil
MCDM-2469|creates this new character he's a warlock named graves and one of the cool things about warlocks at least his
MCDM-2470|warlock is that he can communicate telepathically which is something I'm not sure I was aware of I haven't really
MCDM-2471|played D&D five that much I've only run it and that's an important point because my players often ask me questions about
MCDM-2472|how their character works about how their abilities work and I have to shrug and say I don't know it's your character
MCDM-2473|you're the expert on Ranger or paladin or in Phil's case of warlock and I think there is a tendency on the players part
MCDM-2474|to look to the DM and tell them how does this work help me out but the DM has enough stuff to do I do kind of know how
MCDM-2475|it works or I could guess how it works based on the other things I know but I want to break the habit of the players
MCDM-2476|asking me how their stuff works it's one thing to ask how a magic item works for instance because I'm the DM and I know
MCDM-2477|how that works or to ask how a monsters ability works because I'm the DM and I have the stats for that but if it's a
MCDM-2478|spell or class ability or a race ability that's your job that's the players job get the players in the habit of looking
MCDM-2479|that stuff up so Phil's character Graves has telepathy and I'm like that's super cool how does it work and he explains it
MCDM-2480|to me only the player with telepathy can initiate contact if you don't have telepathy you can't make any phone calls
MCDM-2481|you can only answer the phone when it rings and the interesting thing about the
MCDM-2482|is that it does not require the two characters to share a language which means if you've been paying attention
MCDM-2483|Phil could communicate with the Dryad that the players met in the earlier adventure that may have had some
MCDM-2484|interesting information for them but wasn't able to deliver it because the players didn't speak still them so the
MCDM-2485|players have learned that the bad guys are holed up inside broken spire keeper and they suspect that some of the people
MCDM-2486|they're looking for some of the Wizards and spell casters that have been taken hostage are inside broken spire cube and
MCDM-2487|they also have reason to believe that even if they're not in there if they've been taken below that the bad guys
MCDM-2488|inside broken spire keep have the other key they need to go into the Underdark so they have a couple of reasons to
MCDM-2489|investigate this keep and the party is on their way there and phil has come up with good reasons for his character to
MCDM-2490|be going after the bad guys in broken spire key graves was a member of an adventuring party they were ambushed by
MCDM-2491|these orcs the orcs took everybody captive but graves was knocked unconscious and left behind thought four
MCDM-2492|dead and when he wakes up he's in the middle of a swamp he doesn't know anybody is and he's been tracking the
MCDM-2493|orcs back to their keep and I got together with Phil before the game and I role played for about an hour his
MCDM-2494|character making it through the forest arriving it to keep what do you do he wanted to investigate there was a sense
MCDM-2495|of I want to get some information I want to learn some stuff but I don't want to get in over my head because I am alone
MCDM-2496|so broken spire keep is surrounded by a hundred-foot clearing in every direction and one of the things that Phil didn't
MCDM-2497|know was that if you cross that clearing there's about a 50% chance you're gonna hit a pit trap now obviously if you're
MCDM-2498|searching you'll find it this is one of the reasons back in the players handbook in the 80s they had a ten-foot pole it
MCDM-2499|wasn't because they expected you to do any pole vaulting it's because you were expected to use it to tap the ground in
MCDM-2500|front of you or tap the ceiling to see if there were any pit traps or any you know traps that were gonna spring on you
MCDM-2501|and try to cut off your head but these players are from a more modern tradition where they don't use ten-foot poles for
MCDM-2502|stuff like that Phil just goes invisible and thinks that's enough to get him safely across the clearing the orcs
MCDM-2503|won't be able to see him true but pit traps don't care if you're invisible or not
MCDM-2504|so I said there was a 50% chance actually the adventurer says there's a 50% chance you're gonna encounter one of
MCDM-2505|these things on the way across the clearing and I rolled and there was a pit trap and he fell into it and he took
MCDM-2506|some damage from falling and I think maybe there was some spikes down there I don't remember but he was able to climb
MCDM-2507|his way up no problem I didn't really want that to turn into anything I just wanted to show him there are pit traps
MCDM-2508|around here you have figured that out and now Phil has that information and when he meets up with the heroes and
MCDM-2509|they're talking about assaulting the keith's he can convey to them hey there pit traps around here watch out so he
MCDM-2510|falls into a pit trap he gets out he tries to climb the walls the KP discovers that the walls are
MCDM-2511|climb abut he's a bad climber so he retreats and he goes back into the forest any weights he wants to watch and
MCDM-2512|see are there patrols there are what is the nature of the patrols they have hellhounds orcs and hellhounds bad news
MCDM-2513|now the adventure I bought has no hellhounds in it but also the adventure I bought has no orcs in it it's a bandit
MCDM-2514|lair but the players have already fought humans and bandits and I want to mix it up so I made it orcs and because the
MCDM-2515|players have also already fought a couple of orcs I want it mixed that up a little bit so I gave them some
MCDM-2516|hellhounds I mean I could have given them more dogs or dire wolves but hellhounds are cool and even though
MCDM-2517|hellhounds are nasty I have the power behind the screen to kind of adjust them to make them level appropriate so Graves
MCDM-2518|is sitting there hiding in the forest and then he notices this party of adventurers show up and he watches them
MCDM-2519|for a little while and then he decides to make contact and here we arrive at the lesson of my last D&D session Phil
MCDM-2520|is a artist and he's an adult and so he thought this was an interesting opportunity to create some drama he just
MCDM-2521|pitched a cool scene in his head where this warlock with a telepathy makes mental contact with the heroes and they
MCDM-2522|wonder what the hell's going on what is that voice I hear in my head is that the bad guys and then he arrives and they're
MCDM-2523|like wow it's a warlock who is this guy what does he want is he a good guy is he a bad guy now that scene that Phil
MCDM-2524|imagined down which i think is cool only makes sense if it's a story if this were real there are lots of reasons why these
MCDM-2525|characters would try to kill that guy as soon as I saw him they would suspect you as a bad guy they were waiting for a
MCDM-2526|patrol to show up anyway in addition to telepathy which is cool he also has an owl familiar named mojo and so he
MCDM-2527|thought it would be cool to this owl sort of lights up on a branch and all of a sudden the players hear this voice in
MCDM-2528|their head and they start wondering what's going on all this is just an opportunity for a dramatic introduction
MCDM-2529|to this cool character but the players I think were somewhat immature they quickly got impatient with the drama I
MCDM-2530|think maybe they thought it awkward Phil was speaking in character and most of these players are new to D&D and they're
MCDM-2531|not really comfortable speaking in character so for instance when the players see this owl on the branch they
MCDM-2532|start talking about shooting and killing it I'm sure that they could come up with good reasons why their characters
MCDM-2533|wouldn't trust the owl and they would think was an evil wizard familiar and when they hear the voice in their head
MCDM-2534|they would be suspicious there are good reasons to do that but they don't further drama and they are sitting at
MCDM-2535|the same table with Phil playing graves they know it's him trying to introduce character and what I should have done
MCDM-2536|was I should have stopped and said guys this is Phil trying to introduce his new character it's just a dramatic moment
MCDM-2537|play along let him have this dramatic moment he's about to join the team let it be cool I think often as Dungeon
MCDM-2538|Master's we don't say things because we don't want to interrupt the flow and we don't to tell the players what to do but
MCDM-2539|if we do say the right thing and the right way the players will be like okay that's cool and this is one of those
MCDM-2540|instances I know these guys I'm a hundred percent certain if I had just said guys let Phil introduce let's come
MCDM-2541|up with a cool way let's make this a cool scene let's make this a memorable introduction for graves the players
MCDM-2542|wanna play it along but I didn't say that and so afterwards Phil was kind of frustrated he told me he said I really
MCDM-2543|thought I had a cool introduction there and it didn't happen I don't think he blamed me but I blame me right on the
MCDM-2544|dungeon master I have more power at the table than the other players I can guide things right the ship of the game is
MCDM-2545|going in a certain direction yes and has inertia but as the dungeon master it's my job to blow on the sails to steer it
MCDM-2546|into the ports that I think it belongs in I don't just want to pick the ship up and drop it where I think it needs to go
MCDM-2547|I want to get there on its own so I just want to blow on the sails a little bit and this was one of the opportunities to
MCDM-2548|do that and I didn't do it and part of me also was wanting the same thing the other players wanted which was to get to
MCDM-2549|the action enough of the blob well I want to kill stuff but actually I like the blah blah too and so as the dungeon
MCDM-2550|master it's my opportunity to encourage that I should have done it I didn't so lesson learned when one of the players
MCDM-2551|has a cool moment that you believe in encourage the other players to play along literally use that language say
MCDM-2552|come on guys let's play along so that's the lesson from this video character introductions if you want to now now
MCDM-2553|that's fine but for those of you who've been following the campaign and one know what happens next
MCDM-2554|there was a patrol and or cannon hellhound and the Patrol found these guys and they were kind of they weren't
MCDM-2555|surprised and the patrol wasn't surprised so a battle broke out I used the chart on the DM screen to determine
MCDM-2556|the starting distance of the encounter and one of the first things that happened was the hellhound
MCDM-2557|called out to alert the keep that there are intruders at the gates basically that but with hellhounds and I
MCDM-2558|made a point to say that the hellhounds that the sound it made was not a normal organic sound I wanted it to sound
MCDM-2559|almost like a special-effects from a movie like yeah like that so the players know the keep is alerted and as a result
MCDM-2560|the Patrol has already succeeded even though combat hasn't started they dispatch the patrol easily but the
MCDM-2561|hellhound does breathe fire so the players are like wow hellhounds bad news they retreat the rest they come back now
MCDM-2562|there are two patrols and Phil came up with a really cool idea he had his al mojo fly around the keep at any time he
MCDM-2563|found a patrol he would stop and circle around it and then move on to the next one so the players knew in advance there
MCDM-2564|were two patrols that became super useful to them the hellhounds get their call off which means the keep is alerted
MCDM-2565|again but now they've dispatched three or four orcs and three or four hellhounds and I am keeping track of how
MCDM-2566|many orcs and how many hellhounds are in the keep which they know so they know they've depleted the orcs resources a
MCDM-2567|little bit but that's the end of that that orcs are now like we are under siege normal patrols everybody on high
MCDM-2568|alert and the players know that the orcs are on high alert so they start wondering okay what are we gonna do we
MCDM-2569|need to get in there they decamp once again they rest up they come back they know the orcs are waiting for them and
MCDM-2570|they come up with a plan Zach playing eeeh Gousha the druid can turn into a tiny insect like a spider
MCDM-2571|he's done that before he can do it twice per day it lasts an hour each time meanwhile mojo the owl can drop him off
MCDM-2572|anywhere in the Cape he wants so he pitches this idea let me go in there and Scout the key I can move undetected they
MCDM-2573|won't suspect a spider I can go into every room and tell you where all the bad guys are if they have captives where
MCDM-2574|the captives are I think this is a great idea and I tell them that these are new players so I want to make sure they
MCDM-2575|understand what I think about their plans so this was super cool I enjoyed doing this quite a lot I've done stuff
MCDM-2576|like this before and it's always fun Zach and I got together at lunch we work together it makes it easy and we got
MCDM-2577|together in the conference room and I put up the DM screen it was just him and me and he had a piece of graph paper and
MCDM-2578|I started describing the key now normally what I do because it's all the players at the table is I take a piece
MCDM-2579|of graph paper and I draw the entrance of the dungeon or the key for the tower or whatever and I asked them what
MCDM-2580|they're going to do and as they explore I fill in their map and then I hand the map back to them and they look at it and
MCDM-2581|study it and try to figure out what are we going to do that's the technique I developed over the last thirty years
MCDM-2582|such as makes everything go in an incredibly straightforward manner because when all
MCDM-2583|the players are involved I don't really think there's any advantage in worrying about like getting lost or anything like
MCDM-2584|that but this was a special situation where it was just one player on his own and he was inspired form he wasn't able
MCDM-2585|to take notes or anything like that so I described everything just using natural language and it was up to Zach
MCDM-2586|to draw his own map and I explained that to him I explained this is a cool opportunity for us to roleplay the act
MCDM-2587|of you exploring this keep and you're gonna have to take your own notes based purely on my description and I told him
MCDM-2588|your notes may end up being inaccurate but that represents the difference between what you remember as a spider
MCDM-2589|and the reality so i front-loaded the idea that there could be discrepancies between his map and the real map and
MCDM-2590|that that was kind of neat because it represented his faulty memory and perception and he liked that he thought
MCDM-2591|that was dramatic and cool so we went for it so he spent we did it all through lunch and then we did it before the
MCDM-2592|session in the next week so it was probably an hour and a half of him exploring both levels of the key on the
MCDM-2593|top level he found a bunch of orcs he also found a big feasting hall he found the kennels they keep the hellhounds in
MCDM-2594|and the first room he entered he found it was a large room and in that room was a makeshift cage basically like a kennel
MCDM-2595|but for humans and in that cage was a young boy that was the only description I gave him and he didn't inquire any
MCDM-2596|further this is an important point stay tuned although we may not get to why that's an important point until the next
MCDM-2597|time we play so he found one room on the top level that has one prisoner in a fund a bunch of works he found the
MCDM-2598|hellhounds he found an ogre and that's important the players had seen the ogre in the courtyard of the keep through the
MCDM-2599|Owls eyes graves can see through his familiars eyes which is super cool so they knew there was an ogre in the
MCDM-2600|courtyard I described him as being smaller than Hill Drive but bigger than an orc and they're like what is that
MCDM-2601|they literally had not thought of an ogre and now zach has found the ogre he's like oh this is that thing he's
MCDM-2602|like yeah smaller than a hill giant bigger than an orc I get it so he's taking all these notes and he finds
MCDM-2603|these stairs down he maps out the lower level to the best of his ability and at this point starts to get a little bit
MCDM-2604|abstract just because he is running out of graph paper so he starts to mark things as there's a bunch of rooms here
MCDM-2605|they're all alike there were a couple of doors it looks like it's just a wizard's study and he finds the other prisoners
MCDM-2606|that are down here he finds two dwarves and a dragon born he finds an orc guard and the hellhound down here but he
MCDM-2607|doesn't find some of the stuff he's looking for like he knows that there's a passage from here down into the
MCDM-2608|Underdark he knows that there is an ork leader here named Bonebreaker Dora
MCDM-2609|Corre I think of Bonebreaker as being like chieftain it's a title I wanted to convey to Zak the player that there were
MCDM-2610|secret doors that he was missing and so right as he's kind of reaching the end of the dungeon and there's no more place
MCDM-2611|to explore he's starting to wonder where are the other things that I was looking for I described how he retraces his
MCDM-2612|steps and turns a corner he had already explored and he sees a halfling thief moving from one room to the stairs up
MCDM-2613|and I said that thief was not in that room when you walked past it the first time so the idea is there's a secret
MCDM-2614|drawer around here somewhere the halfling thief along with one of the dwarves he found prisoner are members of
MCDM-2615|graves as early party although there's something interesting about that halfling thief that i'm not going to
MCDM-2616|tell you and I haven't told Zack and the players aren't going to find out until the next video like this so Zack returns
MCDM-2617|to the players and he shows them his map which I'm going to show you right now so here on the right is the actual map of
MCDM-2618|broken spire keep and here on the left is Zacks map which he made purely by following my instructions my
MCDM-2619|descriptions were purely in terms of the dimensions of the room it's 30 feet north-south it's 40 feet east-west
MCDM-2620|there's a door in the northeast corner right he did a pretty good job it was actually really cool it was impressive
MCDM-2621|and I don't think apart from not finding secret doors I don't think he screwed anything up so he returns to the players
MCDM-2622|and they start concocting a plan of how to get in there is a spire it is broken and the orcs are using it as a
MCDM-2623|watchtower there was always an orc up there and there's a bell up there in the orc rings the bell if he sees anything
MCDM-2624|interesting and unlike a normal spire that has a roof on it this is a broken spire and as a result the orc can kind
MCDM-2625|of just look around he's standing on a platform basically a raised platform it's got a broken wall that provides
MCDM-2626|some cover but there's a big open part and he can walk around the entire thing and using the arrow slits that are up
MCDM-2627|there and the missing wall he has a 360 degree view of the area that makes it very difficult for anyone to cross the
MCDM-2628|hundred feet of clearing that are all around to keep without him noticing so this becomes their point of entry
MCDM-2629|there's a trap door that leads to the stairs down those stairs down go all the way from the top level down to the
MCDM-2630|middle level down to the bottom level here's a diagram they made this is Zacks diagram of the three-dimensional view of
MCDM-2631|the tower there's an orc up there and they have an idea Graves has a wand of binding if he
MCDM-2632|zaps the orc with it the orc will be frozen in place and they can take him out they can scale the tower there's
MCDM-2633|nothing the orc can do about this prompts a question and one I don't know the answer to it first which is if
MCDM-2634|you cast a spell as somebody do they know and I'm like you know what I don't know let's look it up we were able to
MCDM-2635|find the answer and the answer was unless there's an obvious visual component to the spell often no you
MCDM-2636|don't know so I ruled I thought reasonably that the orc won't know if he fails his save
MCDM-2637|against the wand of binding so their plan was graves is gonna cast invisibility on himself he's gonna take
MCDM-2638|the one-two binding he's gonna go out into the clearing he's gonna wait for the orc to come to the edge of the
MCDM-2639|platform he's gonna zap the orc with the wand of binding he's gonna hope the Orca fails to save and then he's gonna signal
MCDM-2640|to the party they're all going to climb up the tower they're gonna take out the incapacitated orc and go down great plan
MCDM-2641|would totally have worked if not every single role went against the players well not every single role like the
MCDM-2642|first in happened was he crossed the clearing again and I had to remind him I even asked him how are you crossing the
MCDM-2643|clearing he's like well I'm invisible I just walk out there the reason I asked that was cuz I wanted to give him the
MCDM-2644|opportunity to remember the pit traps without telling him about the pit traps but it had been a week since that
MCDM-2645|introduction and fighting with all the orc patrols so naturally Phil had forgot about it I
MCDM-2646|tried to remind him but the reminder didn't work so I told him to roll and he happened to roll well so he didn't fall
MCDM-2647|into another pit trap that was the one role that went in their favor phil was very careful he said I want to make sure
MCDM-2648|I have line of sight on the orc but then I want to wait for the orc to turn around to continue his patrol before I
MCDM-2649|zap him with the wand why because zapping him with the wand will make graves visible and he doesn't want the
MCDM-2650|orc to be looking at him when that happens so I described yeah of course the orc is on Patrol he looks this way
MCDM-2651|he looks around he stops he thinks he turns back to you and Phil says I zapped him and of course the orc makes his
MCDM-2652|saving throw and now Phil is visible and thanks poop so he immediately casts invisibility again that's bad news
MCDM-2653|because Phil only has two second-level spells and he just burned the second one which means everything that happens from
MCDM-2654|this point forward happens without the party having their warlocks second level spells but that's okay Phil's at least
MCDM-2655|invisible again he waits for the orc to come back out turn his back to him and he uses the wand of binding to cast
MCDM-2656|whole person again and of course the orc makes his saving throw again and now Phil is visible and cannot cast
MCDM-2657|invisibility again so he goes up and runs up to the wall of the keep and presses himself up against it because he
MCDM-2658|doesn't want the orc above him to see him and of course the other players are all in the forest watching this and they
MCDM-2659|see him they're like right they can't make any noise the orc is still on patrol is telepathy only go
MCDM-2660|60 feet so we can't communicate with them phil has to solve this problem on his own
MCDM-2661|which he did he used his telepathy and waited until he could see the orc come over to make his survey of the area and
MCDM-2662|now he sees the orc and the orc doesn't see him I had Phil make a stealth roll I had the
MCDM-2663|orc make a perception check orcs are not great at perception I rolled all these rolls in front of the players by the way
MCDM-2664|so there's verisimilitude what happens graves can see the orc so graves uses his telepathy graves can also speak
MCDM-2665|orcish and I said all right Phil what are you gonna say to the orc now field cannot consult the other players because
MCDM-2666|they're in the forest on the other side of the clearing his deputies doesn't reach all the way out there he has to
MCDM-2667|come up with this on his own and he says in my best orcish accent I'm going to tell the orc that Bonebreaker Dora core
MCDM-2668|requires his presence immediately I thought that's a pretty good idea I don't think anything like that should
MCDM-2669|just be automatic but I thought it was a good idea I wanted him to succeed he had telepathy which was really cool
MCDM-2670|and impressive and he knew orcish and was doing his best orcish accent so I said make a persuasion check with
MCDM-2671|advantage I think that's a perfect opportunity for advantage I don't even think he needed advantage though his
MCDM-2672|first role was like an 18 and he's a warlock with high charisma so I think he beat her 20 so I had a lot of fun
MCDM-2673|role-playing the orc dropping his axe and saying drums commands I must obey actually I had fun doing it right then
MCDM-2674|to the orc immediately opens up the trap door that leads downstairs and he runs downstairs leaving the trap door open
MCDM-2675|now graves looks into the forest where he knows his party is he goes and of course they run across the field led by
MCDM-2676|the Ranger who said I follow graves his footsteps so we do not fall into a pit trap well done Matt Albert now all the
MCDM-2677|players have to do is scale the tower how hard can it be well if they could ever roll higher than a 7 it would be
MCDM-2678|really easy and there's a bit of a Keystone Cops moment which when I referenced none of the players knew what
MCDM-2679|I was talking about I think Phil did cuz he's old like I am where the thief tried to scale it it's a simple athletics
MCDM-2680|check but again I don't think our thief Pendleton played by Paul has ever rolled higher than about an 11 in the entire
MCDM-2681|campaign he has never rolled 220 and we've been playing every week for three or four
MCDM-2682|months now so he tries to scale the tower falls on his butt takes a d6 damage and the orc player says well I've
MCDM-2683|got a grappling hook and everyone's like you've got a grappling hook why didn't you tell us that I said you want to use
MCDM-2684|a grappling hook and EJ playing his orc fighter said yeah sure I said ok make a ranged attack role
MCDM-2685|against an armored class of 10 he still has to be able to get the thing up there it should be pretty straightforward it's
MCDM-2686|not hard to hit as long as you can roll higher than a 7 which AJ did not do so the grappling
MCDM-2687|hook just like falls on his head I didn't have it do any damage but I wanted to be a comedic moment right like
MCDM-2688|everything has gone wrong so of course I want to make that a little comedic moment so the Ranger says give me that
MCDM-2689|so the Ranger with a high dexterity manages to throw the grappling hook up there easily get an anchor point and the
MCDM-2690|entire party can now climb the rope and get into the tower so there's two floors to this there's a ground floor in the
MCDM-2691|dungeon below and the stairs go all the way down to the dungeon so the players go down there and they effortlessly make
MCDM-2692|their way to the jail cell with the prisoners or help and at this point I'm busting out my dungeon tiles look I'll
MCDM-2693|show a picture of them right here I love these tiles we'll do a whole of the video on getting on the grid and
MCDM-2694|we'll talk about the tiles I use I have actually lots of different grid based solutions and I deploy them in different
MCDM-2695|circumstances some are expensive some are cheap the players get to the jail cell there's a guard as a whole hound
MCDM-2696|they manage to kill the guard and the hellhound and they rescue these three prisoners and they spend the next ten or
MCDM-2697|20 minutes talking to these prisoners and some cool stuff happens like for instance one of the players EJ I think
MCDM-2698|doesn't have a good hook into the world he's kind of flying by the seat of his pants he's basically playing a mercenary
MCDM-2699|he has recovered and is using the shield of and room the shield mandrim is an interesting artifact it's a powerful
MCDM-2700|shield but it's also a symbol of authority because it's this ancient famous shield it kind of lends nobility
MCDM-2701|and legitimacy to whoever holds it and so the Dragonborn paladin's they've rescued seized this party sort of led by
MCDM-2702|this fighter half-orc who has this shield the Dragonborn asks him about the shield and confirms he's like you risked
MCDM-2703|your life to come here and rescue us actually I role played it I like doing the my own dragon born voice you risked
MCDM-2704|your life to save us right through these big like reptilian dragon guys I imagine with big crocodile heads this Dragonborn
MCDM-2705|gets down on one knee and says I pledge myself to your service if my life or death may aid you it is yours
MCDM-2706|love playing dragon born and ejs like all right I got a follower he was super excited I'm actually really looking
MCDM-2707|forward to role-playing this character with his new like patron his Lord right this is a knight this is a lawful good
MCDM-2708|dragon born paladin and he is now in service and I think that's perfectly cool the fact that EJ's character
MCDM-2709|nicodemus the half-orc is not a traditionally good character doesn't matter to a knight a knight doesn't care
MCDM-2710|if his noble Lord is good only that he is noble and the fact that this character has risked his life to come
MCDM-2711|and save him and bears the shield of and room from this dragon morons point of view that's noble enough so that's a
MCDM-2712|cool moment one of the dwarves is a member of graves his party so there's this great moment where they're reunited
MCDM-2713|I was a lot of fun to roleplay and there's this other dwarf who knows things about the bargain the dwarves
MCDM-2714|have made with the overlord and how it has been subverted right politics so all sorts of cool stuff is happening with
MCDM-2715|these NPCs and after about 20 minutes are half an hour role-playing the Ranger played by Matt Alpert says hey I'm gonna
MCDM-2716|look outside the jail cell that we closed and locked behind us and see if there's anything going on out there and
MCDM-2717|indeed there is he smells kerosene and at this point I deployed my traditional cinematic moment where I move the camera
MCDM-2718|and show the players something the characters couldn't know which is bone breaker Doric or with the human priest
MCDM-2719|that is kind of the leader of this whole operation and a halfling thief that was a member of graves his party and now
MCDM-2720|appears to work for the orcs and a bunch of other works and hellhounds all coming down the corridor to converge on the
MCDM-2721|jail cell won't break a door accord turns to his lieutenant and says mobilize everyone I want every orc down
MCDM-2722|here and the players like oh no right they're trapped there's only one door out the orcs have used kerosene to kind
MCDM-2723|of smoke them out they haven't lit it on fire yet if they try to escape they're gonna be fighting in a fire and other
MCDM-2724|players are thinking how on earth do we get out of here there is literally no way out except past the orcs of which
MCDM-2725|there are about another 20 in this place and they're all converging on this corridor in the dungeon and there's a
MCDM-2726|priest and there's a halfling thief who appears to be working for the bad guys and there's a bunch of hellhounds and
MCDM-2727|somewhere out there is an ogre and the party are hoping the ogre can't fit in the dungeon so good news the players
MCDM-2728|have recovered three of the four captives and the key and those captives are ready to fight bad news is they have
MCDM-2729|no arms or armor for those captives and they are now surrounded with no way out things are looking dire for our heroes
MCDM-2730|folks we'll find out what happens next after the next time we play when I say we I mean me too I have no idea what's
MCDM-2731|gonna happen I was excited to find out how they get out of this as you guys are of course the first thing that happened
MCDM-2732|the next day when I came into work was Phil said to me why did I tell him to go get bone breaker dork or he's like I
MCDM-2733|could have told him anything else I could have told him it's time to feed the hellhounds and I liked that because
MCDM-2734|it showed that Phil understood the reason Bonebreaker dork or all of a sudden appeared in the middle of the
MCDM-2735|dungeon is because graves gave the order to this orc to go get him so of course when this orc shows up and starts
MCDM-2736|babbling about drums talking to him bone breaker dork or who knows there are guys outside the keeper trying to get in is
MCDM-2737|like what are you talking oh right the player characters are on the way in quick mobilize everybody so that was our
MCDM-2738|last session I'm looking for to the next one hopefully you found something interesting or useful in their
MCDM-2739|next episode we're going to talk about introducing villains how to make the introduction memorable often I think we
MCDM-2740|as DMS have a problem we have a really cool idea for a bad guy but we don't know how to put him in front of the
MCDM-2741|players in such a way that the players don't just kill him in the first 30 seconds so that's sort of what we're
MCDM-2742|gonna be talking about as usual there are no ads I do not have a patreon but if you want to help support the channel
MCDM-2743|come by my amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo I'm sure some of you guys are getting sick of hearing me plug in
MCDM-2744|my book but it's I think better than ads I am an independent fantasy author if you like fantasy if you like Dungeons &
MCDM-2745|Dragons I think you'd probably like the books read the reviews check out a sample see what you think I encourage
MCDM-2746|buying the Kindle version because it's only four bucks of which I see three bucks you can buy it in print but the
MCDM-2747|print version is I think 15 bucks of which I see one dollar if you have Kindle unlimited feel free to just read
MCDM-2748|it I get paid for that believe it or not it's kind of crazy next week we introduced memorable
MCDM-2749|villains and hopefully after that we'll find out what happened to graves in the party I think doing episode a week about
MCDM-2750|my campaign and how it's going is ok as long as there are lessons there for a new DM if I ran a session and it was
MCDM-2751|just interesting storytelling but no DM lessons in it then I probably won't talk about it I also have some really cool
MCDM-2752|ideas for upcoming episodes so stay tuned until next time peace out 
MCDM-2753|hey everybody matt covert here less than 48 hours left in this kickstarter we end a Sunday morning 9:00 a.m. Pacific
MCDM-2754|Standard Time and wow I am looking forward to this thing being over I'd like make videos about other stuff I got
MCDM-2755|a lot of stuff in the pike that I'm eager to share with you folks including you know 2001 video I want to a shape of
MCDM-2756|water video I want take some of the live streams that we've done on Saturday nights
MCDM-2757|and sort of redo them just for YouTube to get the signal-to-noise ratio down and I want to talk about backgrounds and
MCDM-2758|indie I want to talk about initiative there's a whole bunch of a whole bunch more I'd like to do but right now the
MCDM-2759|Kickstarter is live only for a few hours more also my friend Lars wanted to let me know that we have
MCDM-2760|sizes for the shirts including women's tall sizes so they'd be a link and the doobly-doo to those I don't know why but
MCDM-2761|apparently this like based purely on the Lara's insisting that I cover this in a video I have to assume that this is
MCDM-2762|something lots of people been asking for this video are covering the appendix to strongholds and followers which is the
MCDM-2763|basic version of my warfare rules as you know you can attract units units of companies of soldiers as part of the
MCDM-2764|rewards for rolling on the follower chart and several of your artists and followers can improve your units or make
MCDM-2765|it easier to attract units and ambassadors make it easier to buy units from other other races having an army is
MCDM-2766|a big part of the fantasy therefore it's a big part of the system and I figured we should cover this and this is one of
MCDM-2767|those videos we're gonna see people in the comments below having you know really really highly
MCDM-2768|developed opinions regarding how stuff like this should work so before we get into the meat of the system I just want
MCDM-2769|to address the assumptions because I think it's important both as a consumer and as a potential future play tester
MCDM-2770|that we understand what the intent of a system is I think two good things to think about as a designer are one
MCDM-2771|what is the fantasy we're trying to fulfill and then to what kind of behavior are we trying to reward on the
MCDM-2772|part of the players the first assumption the system makes is that not everyone wants to control an army or raise an
MCDM-2773|army or fight a war there is a reason that neither third or fourth nor fifth edition' have ever had any official no
MCDM-2774|official source book often will get like an on earth Arkana article about how to do mass comment about how
MCDM-2775|to warfare and that's because they have I believe correctly identified that warfare is not core to this fantasy RPG
MCDM-2776|experience that we're all participating in folks who show up at your table to play and I've said this in other videos
MCDM-2777|they want to roll dice and kill stuff by and large and they are hoping that over the course of doing so interesting
MCDM-2778|moments interesting character moments will evolve regarding making tough and important choices and meeting
MCDM-2779|interesting NPCs and forming relationships with them and the other characters all of those things are
MCDM-2780|important but actually every time I trying to fulfill my own fantasies regarding with the place I think warfare
MCDM-2781|holds in the game try to foist that kind of thing on my players I discover this is hard fought this lesson took me a
MCDM-2782|long time to really internalize it but only a couple of players in any group I've ever played with are really
MCDM-2783|interested in raising an army and fighting a war and in fact some players find it a distasteful distraction
MCDM-2784|they're really not interested in that kind of thing they are happy rolling dice and killing stuff and collecting
MCDM-2785|magic items and and you know salt saving the world and going on quests these are things that are important to them and
MCDM-2786|they're not really interested in warfare so that's why this system and the fourth edition version of it as well is opted
MCDM-2787|in there is no requirement on a part of any given player to decide I want to do this just like the stronghold system in
MCDM-2788|general no one has to build a stronghold and as and no one has to fight a war if they don't want to as a result the
MCDM-2789|system does not assume that a battle meaning a conflict between units of soldiers is going to exist as its own
MCDM-2790|thing separate from an encounter in which you're rolling dice and killing monsters because this is 100% what
MCDM-2791|everyone at your table showed up for there for a battle happens at the same time as an encounter you can watch
MCDM-2792|somewhere on my youtube channel there is the Battle of castle rend which I think actually went really well and it shows
MCDM-2793|how every time there is a battle there is also an encounter and the strongholds and followers book will have rules for
MCDM-2794|how to build this and how to sync these things up so that in other words when the evil bad guy army shows up there is
MCDM-2795|an evil bad guy who's miniature is going to be in the encounter and there he's gonna have his own ally minions and
MCDM-2796|stuff that are gonna fight in the end with your players meanwhile outside the castle or you know in the forest or
MCDM-2797|wherever there's gonna be a huge clash of arms and these two things are related to each other I did it once with my
MCDM-2798|friend Dave who built a tower the lorentz tower there was a battle of valoran towers so there was an actual I
MCDM-2799|had a tower of miniature and there was the leader of the army trying to kill the leader of the heroes while
MCDM-2800|surrounding them in their taps surrounding the tower these two armies fought and in the full version of the
MCDM-2801|rules there are in the full in the in kingdoms in warfare there's going to be rules more detailed rules for how each
MCDM-2802|of these two things affect the other so they're not completely firewalled from one another but I think for the basic
MCDM-2803|version of the rules in strongholds and followers we're gonna try to avoid getting lost in the reeds and try to
MCDM-2804|keep things relatively straightforward and simple so that's the first assumption the first assumption is
MCDM-2805|unless you're doing a one-on-one or a two-on-one game with players that you know are purely interested in warfare in
MCDM-2806|which case you can just use these units and resolve the battle dramatically every battle also has an encounter and
MCDM-2807|players in that encounter can ignore the battle they don't have to command units if they don't want to now the nice thing
MCDM-2808|about it being opt-in the nice thing about it being like well balance wise you know none of these units refresh
MCDM-2809|until all of them have acted so if you Craig don't want to command a unit that's fine we're not losing any actions
MCDM-2810|you can just concentrate on trying to stop the bad guy enemy leader and the monsters that he's brought with him but
MCDM-2811|what I have discovered is having made it opt-in every battle I've run since then all the players opt-in when they don't
MCDM-2812|have to when they don't feel obligated to manage a unit the units are just their cards they sit there off to the
MCDM-2813|side of the table there's no there's no positioning there's no we're not we're not
MCDM-2814|manipulating these units in 2d space trying to figure out exactly where they are in the battlefield the battle is
MCDM-2815|abstracted when that is true players who initially thought they weren't that interested they get done with the end of
MCDM-2816|their turn they rolled some dice and they've maybe done something cool cast a spell and now they're like well you know
MCDM-2817|there is this there is this unit of dwarven heavy infantry I mean I should just I should just make an attack role
MCDM-2818|with them and have them see if they can do something and that is exciting it's exciting for me to watch the players
MCDM-2819|engage with it that way so far it does not fail of course my sample size is not statistically significant but it's what
MCDM-2820|I got so subject number one the battle is opt-in it's up to the player to decide if they
MCDM-2821|want to control any units assumption number two is that it takes soldiers to hold the field in fact this sentiment is
MCDM-2822|expressed in my first novel where the main character Hayden is trying to save this keep that is about two besieged by
MCDM-2823|orcs and they when the people in this keep discover that if this were in that in Dungeons and Dragons terms the main
MCDM-2824|characters like 13th or 15th level they suddenly think he can save us you could bless you could bless our soldiers you
MCDM-2825|can make one man fight like 50 and the main character has to express something that he learned from much more
MCDM-2826|experienced general which is ultimately it takes men to hold the field I know that there are players out there I've
MCDM-2827|seen this I've seen this in comments on forums going all the way back to you know the first edition of these rules
MCDM-2828|that I published back in IO 2001 or 2002 that there are players who believe that their fifth level wizard should be able
MCDM-2829|to completely decimate an army and that there isn't anything the army can do it if that is your fantasy if that's the
MCDM-2830|assumption that you have built in the system is not for you the system assumes that it takes men to hold the field that
MCDM-2831|powerful spell casters can do interesting things but one given unit of soldiers is typically about a hundred
MCDM-2832|people and as a result even a fireball it'll kill some of them it'll scatter some of them but the rest of them are
MCDM-2833|just gonna be like what happened way over there a unit of soldiers is not packed into the maximally smallest spot
MCDM-2834|and so even something like a fireball it may inflict a casualty on a unit but it's not gonna wipe out an entire army
MCDM-2835|although I know there are players for whom that's their fantasy in which case you don't really need any kind of system
MCDM-2836|I don't think I think that can be purely handled narrative Lee through you and the dungeon master I remember my friend
MCDM-2837|Brad in the earliest version of his system so this would have been Brad's the dungeon master that I've spent my
MCDM-2838|career trying to emulate he we were talking about this we were teenagers and one of the players asked I don't
MCDM-2839|understand if I have an iron golem which one iron golem is a unit on its own in the system if I have an iron golem why
MCDM-2840|doesn't it just wipe out every army and Brad's response was no evil it'll be really effective for a little while but
MCDM-2841|eventually the thousands of soldiers that it's facing will figure out they could just get some big heavy chains and
MCDM-2842|tie it to a giant boulder and that's the end of the iron Gong and that may seem ridiculous to you but it was can
MCDM-2843|sing to me I in my mind I could imagine that and I said yeah that makes sense so it takes men to hold the field a single
MCDM-2844|spellcaster is not going to do it and also that the the winner is the army that holds morale and this is a fact of
MCDM-2845|every war that's ever been fought basically you go all the way back to clouds of its are on war morale holds
MCDM-2846|the day so you'll see that one of the things you often are doing in this system is you're making morale checks
MCDM-2847|you're not just attacking that's a big part of it but you're also making morale checks so a unit can't disband a unit
MCDM-2848|can be taken off the field like a casualty basically a unit can disband even though not all the soldiers in it
MCDM-2849|are dead in fact that's typical it's typical that some of the soldiers have have have broken morale they've
MCDM-2850|literally basically become shell-shocked and they've run fleeing especially peasant levies especially human peasant
MCDM-2851|levies will tend to run screaming but also part of this unit is just disorganized they're no longer able to
MCDM-2852|maintain unit cohesion they're no longer sure who's in charge there's no longer even sure exactly which direction they
MCDM-2853|should be facing or which enemy they should be attacking so they haven't they haven't they're not cowards they're not
MCDM-2854|running in terror but they're no longer organized enough to be effective as a unit and that's the typical
MCDM-2855|end of any given unit I think now you have an idea of the basic assumptions of the system which ideally will help you
MCDM-2856|make smart choices and whether or not to back this project because if you listen to that and you listen to the rest of
MCDM-2857|the video and you're like actually this system doesn't sound anything like what I want then it's not for you that's
MCDM-2858|that's I want to make sure that we end up producing the product that people want and we don't end up with a whole
MCDM-2859|bunch people buying something that they're dissatisfied with at the end now I want to talk about the Fant the core
MCDM-2860|fantasy of the system and this is very personal to me but it's I'm the designer I'm the author so it has to have to work
MCDM-2861|on me first and then hopefully work on other people and that is I love I always have seeing a list of seeing an army
MCDM-2862|list and seeing the unit's described as for instance dwarven elite heavy cavalry actually I don't know dorvan cavalry
MCDM-2863|what would they be riding goats that would be cool that would be yeah sure yeah we were armed war van goat riders
MCDM-2864|but you get the idea super elite elven light archers for instance when I see a unit described in
MCDM-2865|those terms it just gets my brain firing all this imagination happens
MCDM-2866|and I want that promise that each of those terms is mechanically significant in that for instance a unit of dwarven
MCDM-2867|heavy infantry is substantively different than a unit of human heavy infantry all other things being the same
MCDM-2868|your ancestry is important to the way the unit behaves that is the core fantasy for me so that's why a big part
MCDM-2869|of this system it's kind of like a lot of players I enjoy seeing this it doesn't matter how old you are if you've
MCDM-2870|never played or what generation you're from some players open the players handbook and they see this list of
MCDM-2871|weapons and they get this fantasy that each of these weapons is somehow meaningfully different than the others
MCDM-2872|and that your character will be different if you pick a halberd as as opposed to if you pick a pike even
MCDM-2873|though there are very similar weapons the fantasy is that there's some meaningful difference between them
MCDM-2874|that's the promise of a big list like that and that's the promise of this system and the way it treats different
MCDM-2875|units also I should mention that there is there's the basic version of the warfare rules but there's also a simple
MCDM-2876|warfare which is just a couple of die rolls and a couple of charts you roll on percentile dice where the dungeon master
MCDM-2877|and the players just figure out what are the units involved in the battle what are the advantages and disadvantages we
MCDM-2878|have like dwarves fighting in the mountains or a unit defending its home these give you bonuses to the die roll
MCDM-2879|and you just make a couple of die rolls and it tells you how many casualties the different armies took and who wins and
MCDM-2880|who loses and you don't have to do any of this stuff it's actually a very simple straightforward takes 10 or 15
MCDM-2881|minutes to resolve a battle because again you're just rolling percentile dies to see who takes which casualties
MCDM-2882|so there are these simple warfare rules but then there are the basic warfare rules which is the appendix and
MCDM-2883|eventually you get a whole book called kingdoms and more fair so what is a you know what let's take a look at one let's
MCDM-2884|show off exactly how this system works you already know how you can get units you can roll in your followers chart and
MCDM-2885|some will arrive and pledge service to you or you could just buy some if you want it you automatically get some if
MCDM-2886|you finish a keep as opposed to a tower or an establishment or a temple these are the iron heart defenders this is a
MCDM-2887|unit of dwarven seasoned medium infantry each of those terms by the way is significant to the way the unit
MCDM-2888|functions dwarves fight different than elves by difference in humans seasoned is how much experience they have medium
MCDM-2889|is how heavy their gear and weapons are and then infantry has a specific role in the battle when
MCDM-2890|you want to make an attack with a unit the first thing you do is you pick a target and there are rules for which
MCDM-2891|targets each unit can pick and those are described in the dooblydoo it's called the order of battle these guys for
MCDM-2892|instance they make an attack roll they roll plus 9/2 their role and they're trying to beat the targets defense and
MCDM-2893|that is relatively straightforward that's just like an attack roll against armor class and this is basically down
MCDM-2894|to how heavy the weapons are and how good these kept these this units training is but then after that we make
MCDM-2895|another roll this is a power roll you roll power versus a targets toughness and the reason we do this gets down to
MCDM-2896|the history of war gaming and how playing an RPG is different in a role-playing game you are playing one
MCDM-2897|character right so it's reasonable in a role-playing game to track hit points and have for instance 73 hit points and
MCDM-2898|then someone does 16 points of damage to you and you have to sit there going okay what's sixteen from 73 you do and maybe
MCDM-2899|you got do some on the write scribble hit or they okay and then you end up with how much either how much damage
MCDM-2900|you've accumulated over the battle or how many hit points you have left depending on the tradition you are from
MCDM-2901|but the RPG is basically roll sometimes that fails but when it succeeds roll that rarely results in killing something
MCDM-2902|but eventually when you go through the cycle enough you will kill the unit this system works basically the same way you
MCDM-2903|roll to see if you hit then you just make another roll to see if you are if the if the strength of your unit is
MCDM-2904|great enough to overcome the enemy units toughness how Hardy it is in battle and if that second roll is successful then
MCDM-2905|you decrement the you take the unit's size and you reduce it by one so in this sense size is sort of like hitpoints
MCDM-2906|except there's no math there's no subtraction there's no damage roll and that's because when you're running one
MCDM-2907|character it's perfectly reasonable to expect the player to do math but when you've got a whole bunch of units on the
MCDM-2908|field it starts to be a little bit more tedious to have to keep track of hit points for each of them and be making
MCDM-2909|damage rolls that result in doing math so there's no math here there's no subtraction there's no adding to your
MCDM-2910|total damage or subtracting from your total hit points each unit has well this is one of the more important things each
MCDM-2911|unit has a size these guys are the Iron Heart defenders are a d6 and so you literally take the card for the unit and
MCDM-2912|they'll be printed in these strongholds and followers book you below to copy them you'll be able to make your own you
MCDM-2913|put it on the table remember the battle is notional we're not worried about the positioning of the units and you take a
MCDM-2914|six-sided die you stick it on the unit with the six facing thumb that they start at maximum size you can have
MCDM-2915|units that are very small they have a D for units that are very large might be a d12 this keeps them at all relatively
MCDM-2916|simple and straightforward because instead of saying oh I've got three units of ironheart defenders know you've
MCDM-2917|got one unit of ironheart defenders that can be very large representing many companies of soldiers so the die starts
MCDM-2918|at its maximum and every time an enemy unit succeeds in an attack test which then creates a power test and they
MCDM-2919|succeed at that you decrement the die by one you go it goes from six to five makes it very easy to look at the battle
MCDM-2920|and see with how big the units are cuz you can see their dice right if there is a unit out there that's got a 12 sided
MCDM-2921|die on you're like that is a huge unit we have to focus on that it's gonna take a long time to kill right which is
MCDM-2922|something you would be able to tell just looking at the battle and then you can also tell very easily how close all of
MCDM-2923|these units are to being destroyed because you just look at the facings on the die this is something I have seen
MCDM-2924|not I don't think people get confused by this I just know that some people don't like it they like tracking hit points
MCDM-2925|they sort of assume especially if D&D is the only game like this they've ever played that all things should have hit
MCDM-2926|points but you know this the I've played a lot of war games especially old school war games and one of the things you
MCDM-2927|learn is that tracking you tracking hit points with multiple units the way you do a character becomes incredibly
MCDM-2928|tedious very quickly and it is mathematically equivalent it's not mathematically identical you'll see
MCDM-2929|people down in the dooblydoo trying to reverse-engineer all the math it's not mathematically identical but it's
MCDM-2930|basically rolled a hit roll to hit this often misses when it succeeds you make a damage roll with a character that damage
MCDM-2931|roll then requires mass with and and it will rarely result in a casualty and similarly here when you make a damage
MCDM-2932|roll it often fails and when it succeeds you just decrement to the size die and as a result eventually in both instances
MCDM-2933|it's gonna be roll miss roll miss roll hit roll at roll damage roll damage it doesn't die roll damage it doesn't die
MCDM-2934|roll damage it does die each unit also has some around stat we talked about how morale works and there are a couple of
MCDM-2935|common instances where a unit has to make a morale test for instance if they are exposed to battle magic which is
MCDM-2936|these almost like epic level spells you cast that freaks soldiers out soldiers are not there typically you know they
MCDM-2937|started as peasants and they signed up to fight they put down their plowshares they picked up weapons they started as
MCDM-2938|peasant levies and worked way up until eventually they were veterans and it's something that
MCDM-2939|soldiers are ten different species react to this differently some are more prone to breaking and running when they see a
MCDM-2940|swarm of fireballs fly over the battle but also units can become diminished which is something it's a this systems
MCDM-2941|version of bloodied from fourth edition if for instance the iron heart defenders that started six when the casualty died
MCDM-2942|reads three or less from that which mean other words they've taken half their size and casualties from that point
MCDM-2943|forward anytime they take damage they also have to make a morale test morale accelerates losing because it just gets
MCDM-2944|harder and harder to maintain unit cohesion as the unit takes damage and becomes scattered and the soldiers
MCDM-2945|become confused are we winning are we losing who are we supposed to attack so there is a point there's a threshold
MCDM-2946|after which every time you fail a power test you you're gonna make a morale test and if you feel that you decrement your
MCDM-2947|die one more time so it's possible to take two casualties as a result of one attack that's unusual actually because
MCDM-2948|several things have to fail you have to fail both your attack tests you have to fail your power test and then you have
MCDM-2949|to fail a morale test but especially with smaller units especially with a unit that's only a d4 it can be huge
MCDM-2950|then we get on to the different traits the units have these iron heart defenders are made of sterner stuff
MCDM-2951|enemy battle magic has disadvantage on power tests because these are the iron heart defenders they are used to
MCDM-2952|fighting matches and you already know how to disadvantage orcs they also have stand your ground this is something you
MCDM-2953|turn on once per battle I would imagine typically when the unit is diminished meaning you're starting to
MCDM-2954|get worried that they're gonna break and run and for the next round all successful enemy power tests have to
MCDM-2955|be rear old so like when reinforcements show up or when the unit becomes too diminished or when you can see that the
MCDM-2956|enemy is gonna focus fire on the iron heart defenders they turn this ability on and it just for one round it makes
MCDM-2957|them incredibly hard to kill they also have something a little similar to like a berserker rage called
MCDM-2958|that just made them angry it gives them advantage on attack tests when they are diminished and enemy power tests have
MCDM-2959|disadvantaged so this is something that fights against that tendency once the unit is diminished to just break morale
MCDM-2960|and run these guys become even more committed to the battle they have seen their allies die in battle and it's kind
MCDM-2961|of it's it's it's strengthened their resolve these stats all come from a Excel spreadsheet I have
MCDM-2962|I've done a ton of work in it has a little drop-down menus where I can say okay what is the race and what is their
MCDM-2963|training and what kind of gear do they have and that gives me the basics for their stats but and I'm not gonna expose
MCDM-2964|that excel sheet by the way because once I've done that I then compared to all the other units like it and the units
MCDM-2965|that it are it's probably gonna be fighting against and I start tweaking the numbers to make sure that even
MCDM-2966|though there's math the math is done kind of blind the system doesn't know you know exactly how I intend to balance
MCDM-2967|things and so I hand a massage of the numbers and that part is important and the stronghold and followers books the
MCDM-2968|appendix the warfare appendix will come with tons of units that you can recruit let's compare those guys to the blue
MCDM-2969|dragonflight now you'll notice that the Iron Heart defenders and there's a PDF with both of these units in it the Iron
MCDM-2970|Heart defenders didn't have a cost because I just awarded them to the players based on the things the players
MCDM-2971|have done in roleplay and that's pretty typical for the way I run the first battle in a campaign is I put on the
MCDM-2972|table which enemy units are coming marching against them to destroy them and the players look at this and they're
MCDM-2973|like oh my word like how do we get units and I say to them I don't know how are you going to get units and every time
MCDM-2974|I've done that it works they don't freak out they don't get frustrated and give up they they say ok they start thinking
MCDM-2975|about what have we done and who have we met that might have something like an army they can lend us this is my
MCDM-2976|favorite part of the warfare system actually even though it has nothing to do with the mechanics of it is watching
MCDM-2977|the players sit there thinking who are our allies but then once they've run through their allies they start thinking
MCDM-2978|about who among the people they're not elide with which of those people like like in one campaign my players went and
MCDM-2979|there was an orc chieftain blood rager catechins who they had they had sort of avoided
MCDM-2980|and as a result they were able to go to him and say hey let's make a deal it was a sandbox style of game where he was one
MCDM-2981|of the possible different quests they could go on but they never went on that quest so they never really upset that
MCDM-2982|character and they were able to go to him and negotiate and make a deal and that was a ton of fun and as a result I
MCDM-2983|had already thought about all of this by the way I argued units behind the screen ready for everything they thought of so
MCDM-2984|far my players have never surprised me in that regard you'd be surprised at how easy it is for you to think of all the
MCDM-2985|different units they could recruit but they've never done this before and they're kind of like they feel like
MCDM-2986|they're grasping for straws but they're not they're just playing through all the
MCDM-2987|stuff they've done in the campaign all the people they've met that you put there for a reason
MCDM-2988|and they're thinking who among these people can we exploit and get some units out of and that creates a lot of Awesome
MCDM-2989|negotiation you're like I remember the players in my night below campaign they didn't expect this to happen but a unit
MCDM-2990|of zareff Neeb living unit of deep gnomes showed up to help them because they had done a lot for the queen of the
MCDM-2991|gnomes they thought that those guys were too far away it didn't even occur to them to go talk to the deep gnomes but I
MCDM-2992|liked the idea that the deep gnomes kind of keep an eye on the characters because they like these guys and so in the
MCDM-2993|moment of crisis a unit of deep gnomes show up so the iron heart defenders don't have a cost because I just awarded
MCDM-2994|them narrative Lee based on the things the characters had done in the campaign but you'll see the blue dragonflight
MCDM-2995|does have a cost and actually 390 points is an expensive unit because the blue dragonflight are Dragonborn super elite
MCDM-2996|super heavy infantry super elite super heavy means they are the most highly trained units you can get and they are
MCDM-2997|the most heavily equipped there aren't a lot of these guys I think there were only like 12 of them in the actual game
MCDM-2998|but that you know one iron golem can be a unit unto itself just like a hundred peasants can be a unit unto themselves
MCDM-2999|just like twelve fifth level dragon board paladin's can be a unit unto themselves and this is such a fantastic
MCDM-3000|tool narrative Lee you meet this order of knights in the world and they're recalcitrant and they've kept their kind
MCDM-3001|doing their own thing and you try to help them out and maybe you succeed and as a result you leave with this tenuous
MCDM-3002|alliance with them and many levels later they show up to help you and these guys they're they're badass compare their
MCDM-3003|stats to the iron heart defenders and you will see that these guys are almost unstoppable like look at their morale
MCDM-3004|test these guys are gonna be making a lot of morale checks but look at their size because they are a small unit of
MCDM-3005|knights they're only a d4 but because they are good King omens dragon phalanx and in fact the blue dragonflight were
MCDM-3006|the last they were the lost dragon flight to that you know good King homeand is long dead and the players
MCDM-3007|found these guys and made allies of them their first ability is just straight-up we cannot be diminished in other words
MCDM-3008|when their d4 you think that's really small these guys gonna be making a lot of morale tests once are diminished when
MCDM-3009|their d4 gets to two that doesn't mean anything special they don't have to make a morale test at that point when they
MCDM-3010|take damage the way in normal unit would they are lore wise they have advantage on morale tests against battle magic
MCDM-3011|because they are also spell casters well each one of them is like paladin mage a paladin cleric they're
MCDM-3012|all multi-class and these guys are used to using and having battle magic used against them it does not freak them out
MCDM-3013|then we get to a new mechanic for omen is the trait because again these guys are good King omens Dragon Knights it's
MCDM-3014|a reaction which means you can use it when it's not your turn specifically you use it when you take casualties and it
MCDM-3015|says casualty equals two so when the casualty die for the blue dragonflight goes from three to two
MCDM-3016|at that point whatever attack did that to them they get to react to that gets to make a rally test which is a morale
MCDM-3017|test you roll ad plus nine if they beat a fifteen which they're probably going to then they get to increment the
MCDM-3018|casualty die they get to reform the unit and those members of the blue dragonflight that are a little
MCDM-3019|disoriented wait who are we supposed to be attacking I think maybe they got an argument right these are proud Knights
MCDM-3020|and maybe they're not maybe they think it's time to maybe who are we working for the right person you make a rally
MCDM-3021|test and they go no everything's fine and they increment the casualty not which means it can be really hard to
MCDM-3022|break this unit every time they get to two there's a chance they go back up to three so something like that because I
MCDM-3023|don't want it to be impossible to kill the blue dragonfly although it should be very very unlikely I might say they can
MCDM-3024|only do that once Bradl all this stuff all this stuff all of it is gonna get played tested a lot I hope and finally
MCDM-3025|they are shock troops this is a ability actually lots of units have lots of bad guys have a unit of shock troops and it
MCDM-3026|gives them advantage on their first attack test and first power test whenever they're fighting a given enemy
MCDM-3027|unit and you can imagine this right these heavily armored dragon men just smashing charging and smashing into an
MCDM-3028|enemy unit and it freaking that unit out that's what shock troops do they scare the hell out of the enemy but it only
MCDM-3029|works once against any given enemy unit because the charge is over now we're down to the meat and potatoes of slicing
MCDM-3030|everybody up there are lots of different units it's gonna be a lot of fun I think for folks to see what the different
MCDM-3031|units are and how they work in the strongholds and followers and of course if this all works at strongholds and
MCDM-3032|followers as well-received there's gonna be a whole book after this called kingdoms in warfare there's nothing
MCDM-3033|except managing your realm and raising armies and fighting battles there's a PDF in the doobly-doo that is the
MCDM-3034|one-page handout I give to people it doesn't describe how to raise units or how to design encounters or any of that
MCDM-3035|stuff that'll all be in the book it is just a one sheet I hand out to my players so
MCDM-3036|they can read it and understand how the includes the order of battle which units can attack which and
MCDM-3037|is what makes infantry and cavalry and aerial units and Archer is important for instance anyone can attack infantry
MCDM-3038|that's their role they're the meatshield in the order of battle but enemy infantry cannot attack your archers
MCDM-3039|until your infantry is gone archers can shoot other archers aerial units can attack anyone but your infantry cannot
MCDM-3040|attack the enemy archers until you've chewed through the enemy infantry that same country's job is to protect the
MCDM-3041|arches there are also rules for siege engines and fortifications and you know there are units that are siege engines
MCDM-3042|there's a unit of intz that are not only a unit you have to fight but they act like siege engines that's it folks
MCDM-3043|that's the basic assumptions the warfare system makes and we covered some of the things that I know people some people
MCDM-3044|wish it worked differently like you know your fifth level mage is not gonna be able to wipe out an entire army of folks
MCDM-3045|and we talked about how units work and what their stats do and we talked about the basic rules of warfare if that
MCDM-3046|sounds exciting to you again I think this book is for you but if you're already objecting to some of the
MCDM-3047|assumptions then fair warning you may need to find another warfare system I don't that's not I don't consider that a
MCDM-3048|criticism that's just then it's because I think we agree that warfare is not a core element of the rules any warfare
MCDM-3049|system is going to be idiosyncratic it's only going to appeal to a certain percentage of the of the player base I
MCDM-3050|hope this one is robust enough to appeal to a lot of people that I know it's not gonna field everybody we have less than
MCDM-3051|48 hours left Sunday morning 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time then pencils down and I can make it I
MCDM-3052|can make other videos about other stuff I could finish the 2001 series I did a whole video on how that I scrapped
MCDM-3053|because I wasn't happy with it wanna do that again and I really want to do a video I promised a video on backgrounds
MCDM-3054|and a video on initiative which is an incredible power when to roll initiative is a very powerful tool in your
MCDM-3055|narrative tool box we're going to a live stream Saturday night then I think Saturday night's livestream we're gonna
MCDM-3056|talk about the upcoming campaign and I will share with you folks the handouts and stuff I've given to the players
MCDM-3057|already and some of the decisions the players have made this is the this is the campaign we are going to stream live
MCDM-3058|for you folks once we found office space and we have one more video to do after this one and before that live stream
MCDM-3059|live stream Saturday night probably around 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time although don't quote me on that
MCDM-3060|sometimes it's 6:15 sometimes it's 6:30 it depends on how many problems I have to solve with my setup here the other
MCDM-3061|video will do I'm gonna try and get it done later today is the summit an example of
MCDM-3062|the magic items that are going to be unique to this book really we're going to talk about the Codex Terra gnosis and
MCDM-3063|how it shows you the way I think about how these magic items should work because it's a good example I think
MCDM-3064|there's like twelve codices in the star holds and followers book and then the only other magic items in there that
MCDM-3065|will make sense for someone who's running a stronghold I'm trying to think of the most frequently asked questions
MCDM-3066|I've got in the past couple days I think the most common question I see online is people wanting to know will they be able
MCDM-3067|to get this book if they don't back the Kickstarter absolutely they want to know what the prices are going to be it's 20
MCDM-3068|bucks for the PDF it's 30 bucks for the hardcover and if you buy the hardcover we if you buy it online if you order
MCDM-3069|from us online we will throw in the PDF for free at that point as soon as the kickstarter is over you will be able to
MCDM-3070|pre-order the books and then eventually they will come out and they'll be available in our online store and I
MCDM-3071|think that's it next video we're going to talk about the Codex Cara gnosis which like a lot of codices is a real
MCDM-3072|item that appeared in my world and we'll talk about how it ended up being used which was a lot of fun and then Saturday
MCDM-3073|night the final Kickstarter livestream or to talk about the upcoming campaign we're gonna stream until then peace out
MCDM-3074|if you play D&D enough eventually you will have a session that's didn't we already do this didn't we do this last
MCDM-3075|episode we're gonna have to downer episodes in a row as well rip off the band-aid this episode is about losing
MCDM-3076|and unlike slog I actually do have some advice on how to avoid or minimize losing but first let's define our terms
MCDM-3077|for the purposes of this discussion failing is not achieving an objective there are lots of ways to fail without
MCDM-3078|the party ever losing a character you fail to stop the ritual you failed to save the blacksmith's daughter you
MCDM-3079|failed to save the town or stop the assassination failed to catch a murderer before he kills again or fail to get to
MCDM-3080|the temple before the enemy party and now they have the artifact all of that is possible without anyone in the party
MCDM-3081|dying losing on the other hand is what happens when the party wipes everyone is dead or maybe only you lost a character
MCDM-3082|your character is dead or everyone's captured all of these things suck losing sucks and if you play often enough
MCDM-3083|sooner or later you're going to lose when that happens you're gonna have a bad time
MCDM-3084|you're gonna blame the other players the dungeon master or yourself okay that's natural it sucks when things go bad
MCDM-3085|awfully dramatic though isn't it I've been on both sides of dozens of encounters where the player is lost and
MCDM-3086|I've noticed something over the years it always sucks losing always sucks but there is losing that's dramatic and
MCDM-3087|losing the makes you feel stupid both are unpleasant but one is memorable and sometimes satisfying the other is
MCDM-3088|profoundly unfun wanna which is the most common reason for feeling stupid but it is one of two things
MCDM-3089|I don't even know why we're doing this players can and do get themselves into situations where they go into an
MCDM-3090|encounter for no reason other than because it's there because it's the next one because they stumbled onto it they
MCDM-3091|didn't have a clear goal other than more XP and treasure and look just knowing that is good knowing the only reason
MCDM-3092|we're down here is for XP and treasure is good because it means you're not going to fight to the death let's get
MCDM-3093|out of here we were only down here for treasure and XP and this isn't worth it having a clear goal is important because
MCDM-3094|it sets expectations dying in the attempt to save someone to stop a ritual save the world this makes sense but
MCDM-3095|dying just because you were curious about what's in the next room that happens you will hate it unless you're
MCDM-3096|just not that attached to your character back in the day you never really expected a new character to live so we
MCDM-3097|tended to be very brash in irrational at low levels and then incredibly risk-averse at high levels the lesson
MCDM-3098|here isn't always have a clear goal because that's not reasonable and it's not always fun but the lesson is the
MCDM-3099|mindful when you casually walk into the next room and discover there's a Medusa in there that's when it's time to think
MCDM-3100|about retreating don't wait until you're unconscious it's too late it's just a knack recognizing that Oh moment where
MCDM-3101|no plan intersects with super-hard encounter wait what was our plan again this
MCDM-3102|competes with I don't even know why we're doing this for the most common reason failure is unfun because we never
MCDM-3103|felt like a team cooperating working with a purpose you felt like a bunch of randomly assembled
MCDM-3104|grab a stick characters and not listening to each other not coordinating no plan even if your plan falls apart in
MCDM-3105|the first round of combat even if your plan is revealed to be flawed as soon as initiative is called act of planning is
MCDM-3106|a good exercise because it requires communicating listening building consensus leadership all those things
MCDM-3107|will be useful in the battle even if the plan proves worthless there's a famous phrase no plan survives contact with the
MCDM-3108|enemy the debater quote is from eisenhower plans are worthless but planning is
MCDM-3109|everything a lot of total party kills I've witnessed from both sides of the screen you don't need a TPK to destroy a
MCDM-3110|campaign sometimes it only takes one death for the group to feel like it's not worth continuing a lot of party
MCDM-3111|wipes I've experienced or because the players just walked into the next room no plan no scouting no listening no
MCDM-3112|searching never interrogated the prisoner no sense that maybe the encounters were getting tougher and they
MCDM-3113|were low on resources if that's never happened to you good but when it does it will suck because you will blame
MCDM-3114|yourself and feel dumb why didn't we stop and think about this losing doesn't feel as bad as feeling stupid which is
MCDM-3115|funny because I think we all feel stupid all the time you think we'd be used to it by now plans and goals are related
MCDM-3116|it's easier to have a plan if you have a clear goal and one thing I've noticed is that players without a plan and without
MCDM-3117|a goal tend to get frustrated because they spend the entire battle reacting they never feel like they have momentum
MCDM-3118|they're always dealing with a problem instead of being the problem the bad guys have to deal with if you have these
MCDM-3119|two things a goal and a plan you are in good shape regardless of whatever's in the next room
MCDM-3120|there's another tool I rarely see deployed that will save you a lot of time retreat actually let's not call it
MCDM-3121|that retreat has a negative connotation sounds like failing let's call it retrograde progress in my long and
MCDM-3122|lengthy experience as a player at a DM retreat comes in six stages the point in the battle where it became clear you
MCDM-3123|were out match and it was time to run while everyone was still alive three rounds later
MCDM-3124|someone suggests retreating two rounds after that a character falls unconscious and now two or more players are talking
MCDM-3125|about retreating the next round another character falls unconscious and a player finally declares their intention to
MCDM-3126|retreat the next round that player is killed the remaining players then run around like chickens with their heads
MCDM-3127|cut off one of them by sheer luck manages to escape and the rest of the party is dead or captured someone at
MCDM-3128|this point says I said we should read why didn't we retreat and someone else responds well instead of saying we
MCDM-3129|should retreat why didn't you retreat this is the crux of the issue the best advice I can give
MCDM-3130|you never get involved in a land war in Asia the second best advice I can give you is don't talk about retreating
MCDM-3131|retreat don't wait to build consensus it will never come building consensus relies at least in part in some degree
MCDM-3132|of enthusiasm and you're not going to get people enthusiastic about running away players don't like retreating
MCDM-3133|regardless of how useful it is feels like giving up but when one player leads when one player says the five magic
MCDM-3134|words other players follow what are the five magic words or surely you know you got it one mistake players make is
MCDM-3135|treating Dede like a war game a game with rules that force both sides in the battle to be roughly equal in power
MCDM-3136|pretty much any game you play card games board games video games the expectation is if you're fighting something there is
MCDM-3137|some design in the background making the battle fair this is not true for D&D and assuming this often leads to certain
MCDM-3138|death correct even if you use the rules for building encounters in the dmg which I or not those rules are merely
MCDM-3139|guidelines and cannot really cover every eventuality I don't really believe D&D is or should be about fair fights
MCDM-3140|because your characters exist in a world that's masquerading as real and the real world doesn't have fair fights often the
MCDM-3141|battles are imbalanced in favor of the players because that makes them feel badass but sometimes the battles are
MCDM-3142|imbalanced against them the bad guys want to win that attitude the bad guys want to win happens in this box it's
MCDM-3143|bounded outside the box are absurd implausible fights where first little characters
MCDM-3144|be holders that's just that's incredibly poor sportsmanship on behalf of the M but there's an awful lot inside that box
MCDM-3145|including crazy fights I have no idea how the players will beat let's get to some examples both for my current
MCDM-3146|campaign the first night we played in my current night below campaign the players had an epic battle against skeletons and
MCDM-3147|zombies in the tavern it was the middle of the night and when they were done there were low on spells low on hit
MCDM-3148|points but high on victory then they heard glass shattering somewhere out in the village now shrouded by a mysterious
MCDM-3149|fog that's redundant by the way all fog in D&D is mysterious it's never just foggy it's never just a
MCDM-3150|pool of water it's never just a full moon beware the moon much that dude was an experienced D&D player I did this on
MCDM-3151|purpose I got them low on resources but high on victory and then placed before them an impossible task I gave him that
MCDM-3152|impossible - because that's dramatic drama is a question with tension will the heroes if there's no tension in the
MCDM-3153|question there's no drama to me it's a kind of seduction putting this delicious mystery in front of the players just
MCDM-3154|when they are least equipped to deal with it oh come on just one more bite it's only what for food I'll often say
MCDM-3155|something like oh well if you guys are going to be cowards we can skip til tomorrow morning we'll be rested ready
MCDM-3156|and all the excitement will be over and there'll be no XP and no treasure I do this because no matter how much i taunt
MCDM-3157|them the players know the decision is up to them they know I think they should not listen to me and that's part of the
MCDM-3158|fun given how beaten up they were I literally thought they were going to stay in the inn and rest they went out
MCDM-3159|into the night to rescue whoever was being attacked you know only because you talked to them
MCDM-3160|I would never do that you're a terrible person many people would agree with that in the battle that ensued against ladies
MCDM-3161|aerials minions which I think I've talked about elsewhere it seemed clear the players were badly
MCDM-3162|out matched then something interesting happened the archer ranger decided to make a run for it this seemed a
MCDM-3163|perfectly sensible decision to me but the archer Ranger didn't really commit because he didn't want to retreat he
MCDM-3164|wanted the team to retreat so he stayed at the edge of his range bow in hand ready to cover the other
MCDM-3165|as they ran then Keck the Dwarven cleric went down unconscious Phil's Wizards Kouros wanted to save him
MCDM-3166|Keck failed one saving throw then the next then the druid went down at this point the archer Ranger really wanted to
MCDM-3167|retreat but Phil refused to leave he was going to stay and fight to the death if need be because as he said I'm not going
MCDM-3168|to leave my friends behind I thought that was a perfectly valid reason to commit suicide by zombie stay behind
MCDM-3169|defending your wounded friend and I'm 100% certain that if Phil's wizard had died right then Phil would have been
MCDM-3170|100% okay with it because it was his choice he knew what he was doing and it was dramatic arresting Lee the archer
MCDM-3171|Rangers player was really really upset by all this he was upset that Phil refused to retreat he felt like we
MCDM-3172|agreed we needed to retreat and now you're not retreating well because the tests had changed now Keck was dying and
MCDM-3173|skoros the wizard wasn't going to leave him behind Phil said things like if you want to be
MCDM-3174|a coward and run that's your business I am NOT a coward I'm not afraid to die defending my friends now this is exactly
MCDM-3175|what I would have said you know if you're gonna run run but don't run and act like it's bravery when you have to
MCDM-3176|heal kill don't dog of course the archer Ranger reasonably said this isn't bravery it's stupidity and it became a
MCDM-3177|huge thing like all week after that days after the game was over we were still arguing about it but the next round Keck
MCDM-3178|rolled a 20 on his death saving throw and he was conscious he healed the druid and now the entire party was conscious
MCDM-3179|and the tide of battle turned they won against impossible odds they won I decided that twenty meant ORD
MCDM-3180|the god of the dwarves or who created the world and a plan for Keck Keck is the chosen of Ord I decided that
MCDM-3181|situation could have gone very badly but I know for a fact if Phil's wizard had died defending his friend he would have
MCDM-3182|thought it was epic a suitably heroic way to die memorable and dramatic he was defending his friend and the town one
MCDM-3183|player felt like he had a clear goal save his friend or die trying for him it was going to be memorable and epic no
MCDM-3184|matter what happened another player didn't know why they were fighting there was no plan and even though they won he
MCDM-3185|hated it he argued about it for days compare this to just a couple weeks ago these same characters more or
MCDM-3186|less six levels later are deep in the underdog trying to kill a bunch of Darrow bad dwarves in order to free some
MCDM-3187|slaves and gain some allies after meeting little resistance because of good planning and tactics they walk into
MCDM-3188|the Royal chamber of the Darrow there the Darrow savants the Lords of the Darrow five Sorcerer's between ninth
MCDM-3189|and eleventh level wait for them with a mind flare they just walked in there no scouting no planning ever interrogated
MCDM-3190|the prisoner and there were low on hit points some very low low on spells Anas bard was completely out it was an epic
MCDM-3191|battle count Nicodemus and Searle anavar charged the mind flayers but didn't have enough movement left over to attack the
MCDM-3192|mind flayer stunned half the party that was a huge blow one of the Lords of the Darrow cast wall of fire cutting off the
MCDM-3193|rest of the party now two characters the melee fighters are engaged with the enemy while the rest of the party is
MCDM-3194|behind a wall of fire that is cutting off line-of-sight so the rest of the party all spellcasters can't help their
MCDM-3195|friends maybe they could just jump through the wall of fire but they don't know how much damage it does and they're
MCDM-3196|already low on hit points so they spend four rounds trying to dispel the wall seems like a lot of time wasted but they
MCDM-3197|only needed to roll above a nine and they couldn't do it each round it seemed like the most logical thing to do was
MCDM-3198|cast dispel magic again what are the odds that will fail to roll above a nine turned out to be a hundred percent lots
MCDM-3199|of hectic stuff happened in that battle at one point one of the Darrow savants cast telekinesis to grab Lord Nicodemus
MCDM-3200|and drag him into the wall of fire that seemed profoundly unsportsmanlike I recount this whole thing in a campaign
MCDM-3201|diary later but after weathering all the Darrow's fifth level spells and then all of their fourth level spells the
MCDM-3202|fireballs came out and the party dropped unconscious well Nicodemus he had earlier failed to save him throw against
MCDM-3203|banishment and is now back in the mundane world preparing for the siege of castle rend that's another story
MCDM-3204|the party was captured but not dead the Darrow are slavers and eager to deliver these characters to the mind flayers in
MCDM-3205|the city of the Glasspool they had lost lost badly and while some of the players thought it was an epic battle super
MCDM-3206|memorable looking forward to escaping some of the players thought it sucked during the battle there was a lot of
MCDM-3207|complaining complaining about how unfair the battle was about how powerful these Daryl weren't compared to
MCDM-3208|the others at one point one player complained that I was breaking the rules of magic by having an invisible Darrow
MCDM-3209|casting spells and remaining invisible I said was I am not breaking the rules of magic even though it would have been
MCDM-3210|well within my purview to do so moments later the other players discovered there was a spell called greater invisibility
MCDM-3211|while they were complaining I was not in the least bit bother or worried if I felt like I was being unfair if I had
MCDM-3212|felt like I had poorly designed the encounter I would have felt bad and I would have adjusted the encounter that's
MCDM-3213|not why they were complaining they were complaining because they were losing I've played a lot of League of Legends
MCDM-3214|and something happens in every game one side starts losing and one side starts complaining strangely the side that
MCDM-3215|complains is always the losing side and equally baffling the complaining begins exactly at the moment the losing begins
MCDM-3216|why do they only start complaining once they start losing it's impossible to say I'm sure it's pure coincidence the
MCDM-3217|complaining is natural losing sucks let them complain but do not explain if they say the battle is unfair agree with them
MCDM-3218|yeah this is a son of a [ __ ] I have no idea how you'll survive I don't know how you survived but here's the thing these
MCDM-3219|players this group have gotten out of crazy encounters where I literally thought they're all going to die if they
MCDM-3220|don't do something amazing and they've never failed before now to do something amazing typically because they busted
MCDM-3221|out stuff I didn't know they could do or they spent time getting good intelligence on the enemy or they
MCDM-3222|successfully surprised the enemy this battle they literally just walked into the Darrow throne room Oh scouting no
MCDM-3223|preparation some of them very badly wounded no spells left and these Darrow were powerful spell casters the players
MCDM-3224|had a bad time all talked later after blaming me about how unprepared they were if they had to fight these same
MCDM-3225|guys again and they did have to fight them again but that's another story they wouldn't do it all at once
MCDM-3226|they lure them out one by one wait for them to sleep wait for them to eat change the conditions of the test good
MCDM-3227|plan no one died during that battle the Darrow are slavers after all they were
MCDM-3228|captured and led down to the city of the Glasspool and some interesting stuff happened that I think I'm going to save
MCDM-3229|for a campaign diary later I know I owe you folks a whole bunch of campaign Diaries I promise somehow I will find a
MCDM-3230|way to get caught up my friend mark once said when you kill one of my characters I
MCDM-3231|didn't kill him by the way the Knowles killer I'm really pissed at you for like 30 minutes do not try and defend
MCDM-3232|yourself that just makes things worse just let me be pissed at you and 30 minutes later
MCDM-3233|I'll be excited about my new character this is wisdom the reaction anger blame these are natural that's human nature no
MCDM-3234|point in acting like it's not blame is one of those magical things that increases the more people there are to
MCDM-3235|share it unlike pizza but you know get over it feel bad yell at each other and move on there's more gaming to be
MCDM-3236|had get to it make a new character you'll love your new character when my friend Phil's first character skaros
MCDM-3237|died one of the other players was really upset because he thought that was the end of the campaign
MCDM-3238|remember it's D&D death isn't the end just make a new character we play these characters we inhabit them we create
MCDM-3239|them we control them over the course of weeks and months it's perfectly natural to feel like we know them just like any
MCDM-3240|fictional character better when they die we feel it lots of players as an exercise and I think a healthy one make
MCDM-3241|a second character while playing the first when it looks like they are all about to die just start rolling a new PC
MCDM-3242|that exercise helps detach you a little bit from your first character so that if something happens it doesn't feel like
MCDM-3243|the end of the world it doesn't feel like the end of the campaign because it's not the end of the world it's not
MCDM-3244|the end of the campaign there's always more D&D you can play every week for the rest of your life I'd never run out so
MCDM-3245|go do it that's the episode on losing folks I hope it never happens to you but like the slog video if it does I hope
MCDM-3246|you think back to this video and it saves you a little bit of strife and maybe when you walk into that room and
MCDM-3247|discover there's a Medusa there and you're all only first level you'll say hey I have an idea
MCDM-3248|let's get the hell out of here Retreat is always an option I know the pace of videos has slowed down I promise you
MCDM-3249|once I get out from under all the work I have taken on the video rate will increase and I think you'll all be
MCDM-3250|really interested in happy with the top secret project I'm working on I'm hoping this video will go up tomorrow morning
MCDM-3251|Saturday morning and then Saturday night at 7 p.m. Pacific time I am going to have a live stream where and mind you of
MCDM-3252|course most of you watching this will be watching it after tomorrow morning in which case there'll be a video online
MCDM-3253|but we're going to on Twitch tomorrow night 7 p.m. and we're going to go over we're going to
MCDM-3254|read live this actually tale hang on standby we're going to go over this tales from the yawning portal it's a big
MCDM-3255|adventure book it's got seven different adventures in it it just came out from Wizards of the coast all of the
MCDM-3256|adventures in here I have either run played in or read with the intention of running we did one of these four follows
MCDM-3257|guide to monsters it was pretty successful we'll do another one for tales from the yawning portal and this
MCDM-3258|time I was prepared I bought three extra copies I'm going to keep one for myself don't be greedy three extra of copies
MCDM-3259|that I'm going to give away tomorrow of live on the stream 7:00 p.m. Pacific time so I again many of you are going to
MCDM-3260|be watching this video after that in which case ideally if everything goes well there will be the video on demand
MCDM-3261|in the YouTube list this episode was brought to you by my novels I am a fantasy writer I've got two novels out
MCDM-3262|you can come by my amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo each book is four bucks of which I see three bucks so if
MCDM-3263|you buy both books you're throwing me six bucks which is working out pretty well by the way one of the things that
MCDM-3264|has caused the flow of videos to slow down is the fact that I'm basically building a multi-camera television
MCDM-3265|studio to do D&D streaming again I'm taking it very seriously I like a challenge I don't like having
MCDM-3266|left that project the old Indies dream to die just because we couldn't master the technology that was mostly the
MCDM-3267|problem and I have a lot of ideas about how to make streaming D&D fun for everybody including the people playing
MCDM-3268|and the people watching and to do that on the streaming terms not the terms of D&D if that makes any sense you'll see
MCDM-3269|what I mean if I get this up and running which we better because I've spent a lot of money on it it's going to be a while
MCDM-3270|we've got a lot more tests to do audio and video tests and then I'm going to do a one-shot where we play a single
MCDM-3271|adventure me and my friends and I will give you plenty of warning before that so you will know when it goes live as
MCDM-3272|depressing a subject as it can be I hope you enjoyed the episode on losing next episode we're going to talk about
MCDM-3273|prepping and adventure and we're going to do that because I did a poll on Twitter and I said you guys want to see
MCDM-3274|prepping an adventure or do you want to see the next episode in the politics series and even though a lot of people
MCDM-3275|voted for both prepping an adventure one so that's one of the things you get if you follow me on Twitter at Matt
MCDM-3276|Colville again there'll be a link in the doobly-doo I know a lot of people want to see how I
MCDM-3277|prep a pre-made adventure something you buy and download and then read how do I take it apart how do I put it back
MCDM-3278|together I think that'll be super useful I actually plan on doing a bunch of these well I take all the adventures
MCDM-3279|that I love and I will show you how I would prep them all so I encourage you to come by my subreddit slash are slash
MCDM-3280|Matco but it's a great place to ask me questions or just ask questions about D&D in general you'll get answers I read
MCDM-3281|every message on there but there are hundreds if not thousands of people on there now reading it all the time so
MCDM-3282|you'll get good answers regardless of whether I have time to respond or not because typically I do not have time to
MCDM-3283|respond I get tons of messages now literally dozens of messages a day I get direct messages on Twitter I get people
MCDM-3284|tweeting at me and asking questions I get emails I get direct messages on YouTube I almost never have time to
MCDM-3285|respond because there's no way to respond to all this and get everything else done I want during my day or week
MCDM-3286|so the subreddit is a great compromise come by ask your questions and you will get good answers even if they're not
MCDM-3287|from me next episode we prep against the cult of the reptile God until then peace out
MCDM-3288|everybody matt covert here you may remember in my previous video we talked about cargo cult thinking I mentioned
MCDM-3289|that players show up to your game because they want to play they want to play in the context of our series they
MCDM-3290|want to play D&D I think that's an important point and it references something way way way back in when the
MCDM-3291|early videos I made where we talked about players making characters and how making characters is sort of this price
MCDM-3292|you have to pay in order to play the game it's something that some people enjoy doing but it is kind of a pain in
MCDM-3293|the butt and it is work it is not playing the game and I bring this up because there was a thread on my
MCDM-3294|subreddit flash our flash Matt Koval there's always a link to that stuff in the doobly-doo where someone mentioned
MCDM-3295|the fact that they had thrown against their players their players had a ship on the ocean they had their own ship and
MCDM-3296|they were on their way from point A to point B and the dungeon master threw as sort of a random encounter I think a
MCDM-3297|ship full of bad guys at the players this encounter was overwhelming it was more than deadly now the details of this
MCDM-3298|post of this encounter are not I don't want get too far into it because the point isn't the post or the details
MCDM-3299|therein it's this scenario which comes up all the time which I have been guilty of I think all Dungeon Master's go
MCDM-3300|through this at least one point where they're they throw something ridiculously nasty at the players with
MCDM-3301|the expectation that the players will run or surrender and when the players don't do that the dungeon master is
MCDM-3302|plumbing why didn't my players turn around retreat surrender and I think the answer
MCDM-3303|is because they showed up to play D&D they didn't show up to run away from things they did to show up not to fight
MCDM-3304|not to roll dice they showed up because they wanted to be heroes and the measure of their heroism is judged against the
MCDM-3305|nastiness of the encounter the nastier the encounter you throw against the players the more likely they are to want
MCDM-3306|to go at it because they're going to see it as overcoming impossible odds which is part of the fun of the game if you're
MCDM-3307|not aware of this if you don't realize that this is part of the players psychology then you're going to throw
MCDM-3308|encounters with your players with the expectations they will run or surrender and when they don't you'll be frustrated
MCDM-3309|and you'll think though they're dumb why do the players why didn't they understand why didn't they take all the
MCDM-3310|hints that I gave them and at the end of that process they didn't have fun and you probably didn't have fun and the
MCDM-3311|only thing you have to kind of console yourself after the game help you sleep at night
MCDM-3312|is the fact that you warn them or you gave them information or they should have known they should have known better
MCDM-3313|and I think that is cold comfort I think we can do better as Dungeon Master's I say this having done it myself many
MCDM-3314|times and I think I still have it in me to do that I think I still I don't think I've gotten better in the sense that I
MCDM-3315|do it less often but I still think I have it in me that that notion of teaching the players a lesson that kind
MCDM-3316|of encounter showing them that the world is dangerous and capricious and that there are crazy powerful things out
MCDM-3317|there that will wipe them out an instant and to show them that I'm going to throw one of those things that the players is
MCDM-3318|I think it is a it sounds good on paper but is a misunderstanding of the players psychology which is down to the player
MCDM-3319|motivation why does the player shuffle because they want to play D&D they want to be heroes I don't want to run they
MCDM-3320|don't want to surrender in one of the first campaigns I the first campaign i ever played in run by my friend John who
MCDM-3321|was my first dungeon master and was a long suffering done he was that he was like a year or two older than the rest
MCDM-3322|of us but he was still like we were all just teenagers together we were dumb and he put up with stuff from us that I
MCDM-3323|would certainly never put up with now and I can't believe what a bunch of Wang rods we were when we were teenagers any
MCDM-3324|no matter like all the bad player stories you ever heard we did it and John had to suffer through it and there
MCDM-3325|was an adventure he was running and in the adventure and I know this because later in my life I'd now cannot remember
MCDM-3326|the name of it later in my life I found this adventure and I read this section that explicitly tells the game master
MCDM-3327|that at this point the player should surrender you're going to put a bunch of guards in front of the players who come
MCDM-3328|to arrest the players the player character and the do it says in the module do whatever it takes to get the
MCDM-3329|characters to surrender and this is incredibly bad design I think and it talks about how the guards they're their
MCDM-3330|swords glow their armor glows explicitly to send a message to the players that these cars are all outfitted in magical
MCDM-3331|armor over have magical weapons and you can kind of imagine how the scenario went why would I even be bringing it up
MCDM-3332|in this video if not for the fact that we didn't surrender screw that we want to fight and in fact we thought we had a
MCDM-3333|pretty good plan a pretty good way to beat these guys I had a magical arrow I had several magical arrows because
MCDM-3334|John gave me these five cool Niq magic arrows which I love that was awesome great treasure and one of the
MCDM-3335|arrows could destroy a section of stone the idea was logan cg arrow and it could and i remember how big this section was
MCDM-3336|I think was only like ten by ten but I abused these arrows to no end our plan was one of the characters would
MCDM-3337|open up the portable hole that we had I would shoot the arrow into the ceiling we'd all jump into the port will hold
MCDM-3338|the ceiling would collapse on us and the gars but we'd be safe inside the portable hole the rubble would crush the
MCDM-3339|guards and then we would emerge from the portal hole sake this is a terrible plan in many ways and like why would we be
MCDM-3340|able to get out of the portal hole if it was covered in rubble but John reading the reading the module in the adventure
MCDM-3341|they use called modules reading The Adventure where it says do whatever it takes to get the players to surrender
MCDM-3342|John had the portable hole explode and the reason he gave us was that we were at that time in a kind of pocket
MCDM-3343|universe and we were trying to open one pocket universe inside another pop universe well I mean that makes sense
MCDM-3344|that that makes sense but something he invented in that moment and we knew that we knew that rule had not existed prior
MCDM-3345|to that although there was some precedent there with the bag of holding portable whole trick which if you're not
MCDM-3346|familiar with I'm not going to spoil for you right now but we were all really frustrated because it wasn't a question
MCDM-3347|of did his explanation make sense it was a question fact that we thought we had come up with a good plan and then he
MCDM-3348|sorted it and we could tell he was forwarding it just to thwart it we didn't know it said in the adventure we
MCDM-3349|didn't know that it said do whatever it takes to get the characters to surrender but that kind of thinking again it
MCDM-3350|belies it belies the player psychology it fundamentally misunderstands the player why did the players show up to
MCDM-3351|play you may think it's good for the story for the players to understand that life is capricious and there times when
MCDM-3352|they just have to surrender in the world is a dangerous place surrender or retreat but the players didn't show up
MCDM-3353|to write a story you can do that at home without anybody else is the players showed it because they wanted to roll
MCDM-3354|dice and kill stop there is obviously a lot more to the indie that is very reductive thing to say but at its core
MCDM-3355|that's what excites the players is getting to do cool stuff getting to play their character or getting the play
MCDM-3356|which doesn't always mean rolling dice and killing so getting to play their character and there is implicit in that
MCDM-3357|the notion that their character is a hero yes there are many times in fiction where
MCDM-3358|a hero has to surrender to heroes outnumber at a character in a film starting to the bad guys is a very
MCDM-3359|different federal of Kisch from a player character in a D&D game surrendering because the author knows when the
MCDM-3360|character surrenders the author knows that there's going to be an awesome dramatic moment later on that will give
MCDM-3361|them the opportunity to show off their hair wasn't by escaping but the player does not know that in fact the player
MCDM-3362|may have many reasons to believe that's not true we're playing D&D in my friend Phil's
MCDM-3363|game Phil is running a great D&D game it's already one of the some of the most fun I've had playing D&D I'll put a link
MCDM-3364|to his player handout don't be don't be overwhelmed I posted this on Twitter and many people were overwhelmed with the
MCDM-3365|amount of detail and work Phil had put into his hand out and I had to reassure them like look you know my handouts are
MCDM-3366|usually only one or two pages long with exception stay tuned Phil's running this game in a very low
MCDM-3367|magic world and that's something I really enjoy about and I also just really like the fact that Phil
MCDM-3368|definitely understands this I have not read the whole handout by the way I skimmed it I read I seriously read
MCDM-3369|like the first six or seven pages and I skimmed the rest but what was important to me was that Phil believed all this
MCDM-3370|stuff that to Phil this is a real world and that makes it feel more real to me we found ourselves in a scenario where
MCDM-3371|we were on our way from point A to point B we were injured we had gotten in a fight in town and we had the opportunity
MCDM-3372|to leave town and go into the woods and I argued let's just go now let's leave now why restau nothing's going to
MCDM-3373|happen on the way from here to the woods let's leave now and we'll rest when we get to the woods somehow I managed to
MCDM-3374|talk the rest of the players into that as a result when we got ambushed by bandits we were we had most of us had no
MCDM-3375|spells we had very few hit points and then we did an incredibly stupid thing we we followed the bandits to their
MCDM-3376|abandoned high Donald Trump post a picture of it here Phil because he's an artist he drew this
MCDM-3377|battle mat in Photoshop he did it all in Photoshop and then took it to Staples and print out for like 30 bucks so a
MCDM-3378|whole bunch people online were like oh my god where did you where did you get that printed and he was like it's just
MCDM-3379|it's 30 bucks at Staples if you can draw this which is the trick if you can draw this that it's easy to get it printed
MCDM-3380|we followed the bandits back to their bandit hideout and we decided to assault the ambush in spite of the fact that we
MCDM-3381|still hadn't rest and now we're even lower on hit points we're a third level party so a couple people had some
MCDM-3382|second-level spells left but we ended up as a scenario we're half the party was unconscious and
MCDM-3383|the entire time phil was thinking why did you guys do this you knew that these bandits had a bandit
MCDM-3384|hideout and he knew that there are ton of bandits there we had all the intel we needed why did we charge into it well
MCDM-3385|because we wanted to be heroes because we wanted to play D&D because we want to have a good time and as it turned out
MCDM-3386|Phil I think without pulling many punches he made every role I can remember he made in front of us we
MCDM-3387|managed to find a way out of it we use tactics and strategy and we used our abilities well and I happen to roll I
MCDM-3388|was the unconscious cleric so there was no healing to be found but I happened to roll a 20 on one of my death saving
MCDM-3389|throws so suddenly I was at one hit point and I was back in the game and I was able to use Mike and trips didn't
MCDM-3390|make a huge difference in the battle because I was out of all of my healing spells but had some kin trips and
MCDM-3391|through judicious use of ray of frost and kiting the bad guy and working together as a team we managed to
MCDM-3392|overcome the bad guys and Phil remarked between two of these sessions we had to take a break very cliffhanger a moment
MCDM-3393|after I went unconscious we took a break Phil remarked to me because he sits next to me at work he said this is this is
MCDM-3394|exactly what happened in the first session of your D&D game that Phil played in my D&D game that Phil played
MCDM-3395|in and he's exactly right the players that just had a big battle in the end some of you heard me talk about this
MCDM-3396|they had a huge battle in the end they were they were out of spells they were badly wounded and they heard something
MCDM-3397|going on outside the inn and they thought they were going to rest I thought surely they're gonna take at
MCDM-3398|least a short rest no they went outside the end they discovered more bad guys the boss bad guy outside the inn in the
MCDM-3399|fog at night with his little small army of undead and they decided to fight and in that battle the cleric went
MCDM-3400|unconscious and it looked like they were not only going to get routed they were all going to die but then the cleric
MCDM-3401|rolled just like I did rolled a 20 on his death statement it was back up and back in the game and
MCDM-3402|that turned the tide of battle in both instances the party knew what they were getting into they had good Intel and in
MCDM-3403|both instances they decided to go for because what is the point of playing D&D if you're not going to go for it I think
MCDM-3404|in both instances both parties would have been fine with a route we knew what we were getting into and I think that's
MCDM-3405|the difference between just throwing an impossible encounter against your players with the warning or throwing
MCDM-3406|something at them with the hard expectation that they are obvious they're going to see that they're
MCDM-3407|overwhelmed and they will surrender don't expect that expect that they will fight and it when I was done dancing
MCDM-3408|when Phil was done during mastering we both gave the players the opportunity to get into trouble but not the requirement
MCDM-3409|and when we got into trouble we we knew what was happening phil was worried phil was really worried as a dungeon master I
MCDM-3410|can see him trying to think of ways to try to to on what's the word I want to use the phrase I normally use because I
MCDM-3411|want this to be a g-rated channel he wanted to find a way to help us out and I told her I said don't do that like I
MCDM-3412|don't want I don't want the DM to help us out either we live or die based on our decisions in our dire role and that
MCDM-3413|I think is the difference between a good dire encounter and a bad dire encounter bad dire encounter there really is no
MCDM-3414|chance it doesn't matter what the players do and at the end of it they feel like we never had a chance that was
MCDM-3415|dumb whereas we knew what we were getting into and if the dice if I was already thinking during the little break
MCDM-3416|we had during the cliffhanger I was already sick I was already thinking about what kind of new character I was
MCDM-3417|going to roll up I liked Phil's campaign I like the game so I was looking forward to continuing playing and I do look if
MCDM-3418|we all buy it's because we were Damas because weighted dumb decision but it is taken me 30 years of running the game to
MCDM-3419|understand the difference between the players feeling like look if we die here we knew we were getting into it's our
MCDM-3420|fault and the player is getting smoked never having a chance and feeling frustrated I'm not sure I can exactly
MCDM-3421|detail what the issue is hopefully you watching this have some sense of it but I think it's mostly giving the players
MCDM-3422|good Intel and the opportunity for the players to understand what are we getting into what you jus outnumbered by
MCDM-3423|a whole bunch of bad guys some of which are white high - way too high level screw it let's go for it
MCDM-3424|there'll be a slaughter that's the spirit no my slaughter just be aware if you ever find yourself in a scenario
MCDM-3425|where you're thinking the players will surely surrender at this point because I have them so badly outnumbered or surely
MCDM-3426|the players will retreat because they will see that this giant three-master this huge sailing ship outfitted with
MCDM-3427|all sorts of high-level pirates and bad guys is no match for their tiny little dinghy but that exact scenario is what
MCDM-3428|fuels the players into thinking wow we should go for we should give it a shot because even though we're outmatched if
MCDM-3429|we win we'll be heroes it's the reason we showed up plus they want to roll dice and you're giving them a chance to do it
MCDM-3430|you're giving you a chance to roll you're sort of its it's like a trick it's like you're trying to fool your
MCDM-3431|players and they will feel that way they will feel like they were tricked while you knew we wanted to roll dice and kill
MCDM-3432|stuff why did you put this thing in front of us and your answer listen it's a dangerous world out there terrible
MCDM-3433|things happen isn't going to make the players any happier it's not going to mean they think oh well I guess I had a
MCDM-3434|good time then a scenario where you want the players to be aware that the world is a dangerous place in somewhat
MCDM-3435|capricious a scenario like that have there be a character on the ship who is aware of that pirate ship and knows and
MCDM-3436|knows how nasty they are and let's let's work this out think about it if you go to that player you go listen there's
MCDM-3437|this famous pirate ship and they are way too high level for you guys they will wipe you out right all you're doing is
MCDM-3438|you're giving one character one player enough information he can now try to talk the other players out of it but
MCDM-3439|they're not going to want to be talked out of it they're gonna want to go fight the pirate ship I've always wanted to
MCDM-3440|decide a desperate battle against incredible odds I guess if there is lesson it's this
MCDM-3441|never put it encounter in front of your players without considering that they're going to go for it there they're going
MCDM-3442|to attack this thing they're going to fight it they're going to assault the ambush and if you think if you ever find
MCDM-3443|yourself designing an encounter on purpose to get the players to surrender I think perhaps we have made a mistake
MCDM-3444|and I say we because I have done that in the past and I am sure I will talk myself into the fact that the next time
MCDM-3445|I want to do it it's different and that I'm an experienced dungeon master and then at what it fails I'll think back to
MCDM-3446|this video and go why didn't why didn't I listen to me that's the video folks just talking about surrendering
MCDM-3447|retreating and what is the players motivation what do they want to do and why it's probably bad a bad idea to work
MCDM-3448|those expectations because after all they showed up because they want to roll dice they want to do cool stuff they
MCDM-3449|want to be heroes let them I hope that was useful I think the next video will be the undead video
MCDM-3450|a little bit of research necessary which means it takes a little bit longer thanks for watching folks if you're new
MCDM-3451|to these videos and you want to help support the channel everyone else has already heard this a million times come
MCDM-3452|by the doobly-doo then below there's a link to my amazon page where you can buy some neat stuff I'm not gonna tell you
MCDM-3453|what it is it's a surprise but it involves fantasy action adventure really wild things until next time never give
MCDM-3454|up never threader peace out 
MCDM-3455|hitpoints are interesting concept interesting innovation wargames never used them except insofar as your armies
MCDM-3456|hit points were its soldiers we get hit points along with Armour class from an old Civil War game by the legendary Tom
MCDM-3457|Wham called ironclads when your game is about two metal ships firing cannonballs at each other a battle that in the real
MCDM-3458|world ended because neither ship could really hurt the other hit points make sense the ship is fine this is fine
MCDM-3459|everything's fine ooi sank game over gamers have considered hit points offensive since almost the beginning of
MCDM-3460|the Hobby they don't appear to model anything they don't appear to have any bearing on anything because a high
MCDM-3461|Constitution gets you more of them and taking damage causes you to lose them gamers have always always always assumed
MCDM-3462|they were basically analogous to physical hardiness and stamina and of course they did people are not like iron
MCDM-3463|clads where everything works fine until that last attack delivers a fatal blow people get tired they bleed they lose
MCDM-3464|the use of their limbs and organs way before they collapse as a result one of the first and for decades most popular
MCDM-3465|hacks for D&D was wound levels you take your total HP and divide them into about five levels as you take damage you drop
MCDM-3466|from one level to the other and each level after the first imposes some kind of penalty on you as you run out of
MCDM-3467|stamina and lose steam and deal with all the wounds you've accumulated this is much more realistic everyone says and of
MCDM-3468|course it is yes that is basically how it would work this design is called a death spiral because once you start
MCDM-3469|losing in a system like this you accumulate penalties which causes you to lose faster in other words the rate at
MCDM-3470|which you are losing begins to increase it took about 30 years and two or three generations of gamers before everyone
MCDM-3471|collectively grew out I've tried to fix something that had never been a problem hitpoints work because that's how we
MCDM-3472|wished we worked it's how pulp heroes work John McClane runs barefoot over broken glass but he's basically fine
MCDM-3473|takes a short rest to pick the glass out of his feet with no apparent loss of effectiveness he's fine there's a great
MCDM-3474|video from Tim cask which I'll put a link to in a card where he uses a famous sword fight from Game of Thrones to
MCDM-3475|describe how the original D&D nerds imagined hitpoints worked one character swings her sword and the other character
MCDM-3476|has to bend over backwards to avoid being hit cask describes that moment as in D&D terms I hit if the defender
MCDM-3477|hadn't burned some hit points to stay in the fight that attack would have ended them that's what
MCDM-3478|losing hit points is supposed to look like you pull a crazy stunt to stay in the fight and when you run out of stunt
MCDM-3479|points the next attack takes you down I think we could simulate that pretty easily if after we hit and roll damage
MCDM-3480|we tell the player that blow would have killed you but you and invite the player to describe the stunt they use to stay
MCDM-3481|in the game hit points are a meaningful innovation a great invention because they have no bearing on your characters
MCDM-3482|abilities you are just as effective with 72 hit points as with 2 there's no way for someone to tell based on what you
MCDM-3483|can do how many hit points you have for this reason when someone asks what hit points actually represent I often answer
MCDM-3484|they are a measure of your heroism the more you have the longer you can go on being a hero but they're also a measure
MCDM-3485|of how close you are from depth another useful way of looking at it in fact that's what the only thing they measure
MCDM-3486|while you have hit points you're fine when you lose them your bone I think this design actually encourages a lot of
MCDM-3487|foolhardy behavior without the players even realizing it because nothing bad has actually happened to you in spite of
MCDM-3488|losing 90 percent of your hit points you're more likely to press on we are more likely to take actually stupid
MCDM-3489|risks because of this things regardless of how heroic our characters are they would never actually do the result is
MCDM-3490|characters die everybody not colas here and we're gonna talk about character death in D&D and how to deal with it
MCDM-3491|from the DMS point of view there are three basic ways your character can die in D&D you can take so much damage you
MCDM-3492|end up with a negative number equal to your maximum hit points if your character normally has 34 hit points and
MCDM-3493|you ever for any reason drop to negative 34 you die I don't think that's very common except at low levels but it does
MCDM-3494|happen and it's no coincidence we're talking about this right after talking about fudging die rolls because this is
MCDM-3495|when you fudge die rolls you've got the d20 in your hand and you're like this iron golem could easily do 40 damage if
MCDM-3496|it hits twice this round maybe I misjudged the power level of the PCs maybe I shouldn't have thrown an iron
MCDM-3497|golem at three first level heroes the second way is to fail three death saves while unconscious I think this is
MCDM-3498|probably how most characters die especially when you know they're taking any damage while unconscious causes you
MCDM-3499|to instantly add a failure to your death save total and add two failures if it was a critical
MCDM-3500|hit and here's the tricky thing while you were unconscious any attack from someone standing next to you is
MCDM-3501|automatically a critical hit so you automatically failed two out of your three death saves if you're unconscious
MCDM-3502|character is attacked by someone standing next to them doesn't say that in the section on damage you need to
MCDM-3503|look at the unconscious condition in the back of the book so it's very likely if you start taking damage while
MCDM-3504|unconscious you're going to die I think that's the most common form of death because a lot of creatures in dd5 have
MCDM-3505|multi attack and that's where things get tricky because if the iron Gaul knocks a PC unconscious with its first attack
MCDM-3506|what's it going to do next it's got another attack this is how these two ways of killing a PCS start to
MCDM-3507|blend together into a soup of pain which i think is a kind of chowder your monster has multi attack and chooses a
MCDM-3508|target you start by thinking well we have three attacks they won't hit with each attack but they do hit with all
MCDM-3509|three attacks and maybe one of them is a critical and now you're doing four times the monsters normal attack damage to a
MCDM-3510|PC it will kill them you're pretty sure what do you do are you okay with killing a character are the players okay with it
MCDM-3511|I've seen PCs die and no one got upset usually because the player made some decision they knew ahead of time would
MCDM-3512|likely mean their death but this is rare usually what a PC dies it is a traumatic experience because players like their
MCDM-3513|characters they build their characters they invest time in their characters a player's character is their window into
MCDM-3514|your world the adventure and the party killing a PC is tough and often in fact I think usually the DM feels bad
MCDM-3515|afterwards and this is not why we play D&D how did you get to that point well let me ask you a question did you ever
MCDM-3516|stop and think about how lethal you intended your game to be how did you communicate that to your players here's
MCDM-3517|another question do you know how deadly D&D is intended to be we know the answer for lots of other games we know Dark
MCDM-3518|Souls for instance is crazy lethal but D&D let's imagine you do your best to play by the rules as written or even
MCDM-3519|intended how often do you think normal play results in dead characters here's my answer I actually don't know I have
MCDM-3520|no idea and I couldn't even find advice for this I don't know why but I suspect it's because if they gave advice on how
MCDM-3521|lethal the game should be then folks would try to make it that lethal which i think is probably a
MCDM-3522|mistake and that other folks would complain if it were more or less lethal so it's probably smart they let each
MCDM-3523|diem decide for themselves so one thing we as Dungeon Master's should do is think about a how lethal we
MCDM-3524|expect our game should be and then be we should communicate that to our players but even this I think I think it's an
MCDM-3525|incredibly thorny issue and what not really talked about because I don't think any DM including myself can really
MCDM-3526|say how lethal their game is going to be it's just not something the game is designed to calibrate there are too many
MCDM-3527|variables I've watched characters die in games where it was clear no one thought
MCDM-3528|mortality was really on the table including the players including the DM narrative games where players implicitly
MCDM-3529|believed they were building a story and part of the contract with the DM was that they were gonna get to see that
MCDM-3530|story play out and everyone sat around stunned when someone died I've run games where I told the players
MCDM-3531|life was cheap in this world and I routinely threw absurdly difficult encounters at them and they won they won
MCDM-3532|every time and no one died I also see DMS run meat-grinder adventures and campaigns where the whole point was the
MCDM-3533|death of PCs each square foot of the dungeon and it's always a dungeon in these games had to be meticulously
MCDM-3534|tested with 10-foot poles mirrors used to look around every corner lots of instant death fun if you know
MCDM-3535|what you're getting into maybe this is the talk we should be having with our players hey here's how I view death in
MCDM-3536|my world it's common or it's rare I run a very narrative game you're only likely to die if you do something foolish
MCDM-3537|I run a very tactical game you are likely to die if you don't think strategically but I am not really in
MCDM-3538|control of who dies or how often it's down to the dice again with the dice I think we should be telling our players
MCDM-3539|all our players in every game that regardless of our intent or their behavior the game is so complex
MCDM-3540|many encounters some with many enemies with many different special abilities and lots of dice being rolled in each
MCDM-3541|one dozens of times that with no one intending to and no one doing anything stupid
MCDM-3542|characters can die I'm gonna say that again because I think it's important the game is so complex that with no one
MCDM-3543|doing anything wrong characters can still die everyone needs to understand this so you've talked to your play
MCDM-3544|about how lethal your game is and now it's the final battle pulling out all the stops in this context the players
MCDM-3545|know death is an option this is a boss monster it's the toughest encounter this iron golem is about to multi attack a PC
MCDM-3546|everyone knows what that means even still is there anything you can do you're not obligated in this scenario to
MCDM-3547|pull your punches but if you decide hang on maybe I don't want to kill this PC in this moment what can be done you
MCDM-3548|actually have a lot of options and the good news is there are the same options and every other encounter probably the
MCDM-3549|easiest thing you can do to give yourself maximum flexibility is not declare all your attacks before your
MCDM-3550|role if you say the iron golem is going to attack you three times now the players know that if after the first one
MCDM-3551|crits and takes someone down you decide not to attack the unconscious PC two more times you're pulling your punches
MCDM-3552|you're taking it easy on them when the players detect this when they believe they know what the monsters would do but
MCDM-3553|you are doing something different to keep them alive they no longer believe their victory is earned this happens all
MCDM-3554|the time in every game players often get a sense that you are pulling your punches and
MCDM-3555|then they no longer believe in the reality of the secondary world and you have to do a little sleight of hand to
MCDM-3556|get them back on board players will know you're pulling your punches if the necromancer kills a PC and shocks
MCDM-3557|everyone and then says now leave and don't come back the players they may be relieved that they get to keep playing
MCDM-3558|the characters they've invested in but they'll know the only reason the necromancer said that was because you
MCDM-3559|didn't want to ruin everyone's fun the worst thing you can do as a DM is break their hearts everything else can be
MCDM-3560|solved what to do certainly the necromancer could kill the party I mean this is how party is wiped this is how a
MCDM-3561|TPK happens things had to be bad if a PC got killed and now they're worse because the party is down at PC so they're much
MCDM-3562|more likely to lose there's no right answer only you know your players yes if the necromancer says go and don't come
MCDM-3563|back the players will know you're pulling your punches but they get to keep playing the characters they're
MCDM-3564|invested in you might say well now you have a recurring villain and this is true but it requires the players to play
MCDM-3565|along if you kill the entire party the players know well that's what would have happened that's the real story and this
MCDM-3566|is satisfying it preserves suspension of disbelief but at what cost now everyone is bummed out which is more important I
MCDM-3567|don't know there's no right answer that's the reason we roll one attack at a time
MCDM-3568|if one attack takes a PC unconscious you can switch to another PC spread the damage around instead of killing a PC
MCDM-3569|and changing your entire game now this is a reasonable thing to do especially if you explain your thinking hey who was
MCDM-3570|the last person to damage this column hey who did the most damage to this column Hey who just attacked the golems
MCDM-3571|master all of these are good reasonable plausible excuses for the Golem to switch its attack to someone else and
MCDM-3572|they will work once you've done this a few times you start to realize that you can plausibly switch to almost any
MCDM-3573|target and trick the players into thinking it's what the Golem would have done just by the questions you asked it
MCDM-3574|sounds like you're asking tactical questions but you're really just giving the players a good excuse to hang their
MCDM-3575|suspension of disbelief on and it works this works if you do it it will work there's another solution far more
MCDM-3576|time-intensive but it also works and that is track everyone's hit points live my friend
MCDM-3577|George did this when he ran D&D for us at last unicorn games and while it was a lot of work for him basically writing
MCDM-3578|down how many hit points every piece he had left after every attack it meant he was phenomenally well armed to decide
MCDM-3579|who to attack next in other words if you know Bob only has five hit points left you're not going to attack him thinking
MCDM-3580|he has 45 don't get me wrong it's perfectly reasonable for the Golem to attack someone with only 5 hit points
MCDM-3581|this is D&D golems attack people Kasey's dime the thing we're trying to avoid is that moment when you didn't even realize
MCDM-3582|this was on the table it's a wildly different thing to attack someone when you didn't even realize they were close
MCDM-3583|to death if you suddenly ask before deciding who to attack hey how many hit points does everyone have left no one
MCDM-3584|will want to answer and yeah that's because some of them are afraid they'll become the target of the attack but more
MCDM-3585|common is the player not answering because they believe you will use the answer to take it easy on them let the
MCDM-3586|Golem do what the Golem would do I usually hear so I don't ask that question but I can make intelligent
MCDM-3587|decisions regarding who to attack without doing all the work Jorge did by using magnets under magnetized bases on
MCDM-3588|minis a character that has no damage has no magnet under them once they've taken a little damage they get a green magnet
MCDM-3589|once they are bloodied and half hit points or fewer they get an orange magnet once they are close to death by
MCDM-3590|whatever metric you choose to measure maybe 20% hit points or fewer they get a red magnet we did this for the good guys
MCDM-3591|and the bad guys and it was actually awesome it helped everyone and felt much more realistic whatever hit points
MCDM-3592|represent to you whether physical damage or grit and determination or some combination of the two you could see
MCDM-3593|when that was wearing out you would know just by looking now we have a couple of ways of avoiding killing a PC if we
MCDM-3594|don't want to but a PC drops unconscious through normal play and the enemy is still right there
MCDM-3595|what do we do attacking a PC while they're down seems it seems incredibly unsporting to me for one thing they
MCDM-3596|instantly accumulate to death save failures so this is something to be clear you only do because you're trying
MCDM-3597|to kill the character I think this comes down to the expectations in your game I would only do that if I had told my
MCDM-3598|players ahead of time this is how the bad guys behave in this style of game falling unconscious is basically the
MCDM-3599|same as dying because unless the other heroes act very quickly and effectively neither of which they are completely in
MCDM-3600|control of you are going to accumulate a lot of failed death saves very quickly if we started the game by saying listen
MCDM-3601|folks I run a game where the bad guys want to win and they are going to act the same
MCDM-3602|way you do and for the same reason they may ignore an unconscious PC under the quite reasonable premise that they are
MCDM-3603|no longer a threat or they may kill that same PC to remove a potential threat then I think you start to put the fear
MCDM-3604|of God into your players they begin to realize this is not a video game with scripted behavior the bad guys are smart
MCDM-3605|and will adapt however they need to so for whatever reason maybe bad choices on their part or your encounter design or
MCDM-3606|random chance a PC has died now what something I've seen DMS do a lot is claim the lethal encounter the
MCDM-3607|players just experienced didn't have to be lethal if only what comes next is different every time
MCDM-3608|if only they had listened to the hints the DM gave if only they had scouted the enemy
MCDM-3609|talked to someone before attacking them there's always a reason the DM can always imagine something the players
MCDM-3610|could have done differently but something I've learned over 30 years those conversations aren't usually
MCDM-3611|useful when a character dies players often ask what could I have done differently they ask this because they
MCDM-3612|are frustrated and unhappy and if you answer them all you're doing is giving them something to argue about and that
MCDM-3613|is not helpful it's the opposite it's feeding their anger and frustration every time I have answered that I've
MCDM-3614|regretted it when I switched to well there's always something different you could have done and otherwise kept my
MCDM-3615|mouth shut pretty quickly the other players start unraveling the puzzle the other players
MCDM-3616|start thinking about their options and realizing they took a lot of stuff for granted when those discussions come from
MCDM-3617|the other players people react very differently than when it comes from the DM when it comes from the DM it sounds
MCDM-3618|like I told you so when it comes from the other players it becomes problem-solving and how do we avoid this
MCDM-3619|in the future if we set expectations if we explain that dandy is a game and that even a mundane encounter could go south
MCDM-3620|without anyone intending it to if we explain that the bad guys want to win if we spread our attacks around to take it
MCDM-3621|easy on the unconscious character if we track hit points to make intelligent decisions about who to attack then we
MCDM-3622|reduce the likelihood of an untimely PC death and we minimize the bitterness I say untimely because death is always a
MCDM-3623|possibility you knew the job was dangerous when you took it apart from death from massive damage and failing
MCDM-3624|three death saving throws there is a third way a character can die and that is the DM just says you die and that's
MCDM-3625|it somehow for some reason a PC got themselves into a situation where life and death weren't based on chance and
MCDM-3626|die roles and your DM informs you that your character is now of interest only to historians I have done this it's rare
MCDM-3627|but it happens typically the character is helpless and someone else with the power of life or
MCDM-3628|death over them decides dead is better sometimes or the player does something
MCDM-3629|so spectacularly reckless no die roll is necessary like leap into a volcano or plunge into the black portal to save a
MCDM-3630|doomed I mean literally doomed for I was once playing Jim Murphy's paladin because he was out and he trusted me to
MCDM-3631|do it a demon teleported him into hell and gave him an ultimatum serve me as a
MCDM-3632|double agent on your team or suffer the consequences I thought I knew Jim's character pretty well and so I didn't
MCDM-3633|hesitate what was there to think about I said skin that smoke wagon and the DM smiled and nodded and that was it Jim's
MCDM-3634|paladin was dead no die roll necessary when a player decides to plunge heedless into oblivion it's rare the player is
MCDM-3635|unaware of the consequences when my friend Craig ran into the black portal to save Geordi from the abyss he knew
MCDM-3636|what he was getting into it was the end of his character but he died doing something heroic his choice Jim's
MCDM-3637|character really didn't have a choice nothing about how he had run his PC indicated he would for an instant
MCDM-3638|entertain the notion of making a deal with a real demonic evil jim was satisfied I made the same decision he
MCDM-3639|would have made but there wasn't really any decision I once killed my friend Phil's PC the Wizards Kouros and it
MCDM-3640|almost ended the campaign he was a prisoner at an evil paladin's mercy and she had been humiliated by the escape of
MCDM-3641|another PC prisoner someone had to pay and this was an explicitly cruel and capricious character with an even
MCDM-3642|harsher master I decided she would execute score us she could not allow the possibility that a second prisoner might
MCDM-3643|escape it was the wrong thing to do I did a whole video on it you can see how people responded overwhelmingly everyone
MCDM-3644|responding wanted to tell me I did the right thing the players knew well ahead of the fatal
MCDM-3645|blow what was at stake they had many opportunities they ignored so what I do not play this game to execute people's
MCDM-3646|characters I do not run D&D to say well you should have known better it was not fun and it almost ruined the game no
MCDM-3647|Madame sofa story will fix that in reality what I should have done was switch the camera view to the other
MCDM-3648|players who were in the middle of making friends with folks who would help them spring the captive pcs from jail it was
MCDM-3649|entirely my fault a failure of my pacing and I knew it the only thing we can do is learn from these experiences and move
MCDM-3650|on sometimes there isn't a clear way out but if we talk to our players about the game we're running if we make careful
MCDM-3651|choices about how we use our bad guy I think PC death can be mitigated actually you know if the necromancer
MCDM-3652|kills a PC and says this is the end now you will join your friend and your corpses will serve my undying will it's
MCDM-3653|time to stop the game say we'll pick this up next week and next week hand the players a whole different set
MCDM-3654|of high-level characters let them pick new heroes to play and play for two or three weeks as this new party delves
MCDM-3655|through the other half of the dungeon until the new party arrives in the necromancer sanctum just after the death
MCDM-3656|of that PC now the heroes aren't down a PC they're up a whole party of reinforcements who they just spent a few
MCDM-3657|weeks playing and getting to know and who can be more colorful and weird and things they would never normally play
MCDM-3658|now two groups face the necromancer instead of one you see there's always a way that's it folks that's the killing a
MCDM-3659|PC video I hope there was something in there that was useful or interesting I have no idea what the next video is
MCDM-3660|going to be because I'm gonna take a couple of weeks off and prep the D&D stream this is the D&D stream that we
MCDM-3661|did the Kickstarter in order to have fun in order to get this office I'm gonna get all this gear and equipment my
MCDM-3662|players have been waiting for over a year to play so a part of my prep is going to be running D&D for a couple of
MCDM-3663|friends a small group a one-shot nothing elaborate we will film it but I'm not gonna upload it until after the D&D
MCDM-3664|stream starts I just need to get the sent back I don't want the first time I run dandy in over a year to be live in
MCDM-3665|front of at least dozens of people in the meantime we're still gonna do the stuff that we do just have fun we're
MCDM-3666|still gonna do code names on Tuesday night come follow us on Twitch and we may upload a code names video after this
MCDM-3667|one so you get a running the game video and then you can't complain about the fact that there is something else live
MCDM-3668|that we did this fun some people like those will probably keep playing that hack on Twitch which has no real
MCDM-3669|schedule it's whenever I feel like it it's just something I do to blow off steam it's kind of fun and we may record
MCDM-3670|a couple of running the game videos because I may just get bored spending weeks getting a campaign ready I've
MCDM-3671|never really spent that much time preparing a campaign before part of that prep work is gonna be building the city
MCDM-3672|of capital which some of which I will livestream I just don't know when we did already livestream and I think it's on
MCDM-3673|YouTube several sessions of me building the Pantheon for rioja which is where the city of capital is
MCDM-3674|and the only reason really was stop doing that was because I was crunching on the manuscript for strongholds and
MCDM-3675|followers but that's all done and I am free I am free now just to work on the campaign it's gonna be super interesting
MCDM-3676|to see what kind of Dungeons & Dragons is produced by me spending literally weeks prepping a campaign hopefully it's
MCDM-3677|better than the campaign's that I normally run we're gonna find out together any campaign prep that we do
MCDM-3678|live on Twitch we will upload to YouTube so you're not gonna miss anything this video and this office and everything is
MCDM-3679|brought to you by strongholds and followers you can pre-order the book it will be out soon we're just waiting for
MCDM-3680|it to be laid out you'll know that we are close to releasing the PDF when I release a sample of the book that has
MCDM-3681|been laid out the physical copy the hardcover of strongholds and followers will ship early next year along with all
MCDM-3682|the miniatures and the stickers and the shirts all in one big box that's what's gonna show up to your house and all that
MCDM-3683|stuff is in good hands there's no there's no there's no risk there we're literally just waiting for the book to
MCDM-3684|be laid out and and launch the D&D stream so that's what I'm gonna go do I'm gonna go work on that if you want to
MCDM-3685|keep track of Matt Colville and what he's doing on a day to day or week to week basis between now and the next run
MCDM-3686|in the game video I encourage you to follow us on Twitter or we have a great discord that's super cool and subscribe
MCDM-3687|or follow or whatever on twitch so they get alerts when I go live because there may be a point where I'm gonna start
MCDM-3688|working on the on the city of capital the greatest city in this or any age and if you want to see that happen live and
MCDM-3689|be part of the process you're gonna have to follow us on Twitter otherwise we'll upload it to YouTube when it's done
MCDM-3690|depending on how things go depending on whether you follow us on Twitter or not the next time we see each other it may
MCDM-3691|be it may be when we launch the D&D stream it's crazy but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen soon until then peace
