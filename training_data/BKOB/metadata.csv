BKOB-0||to Michelle my love and life partner
BKOB-1||and Malia and Sasha who's dazzling light makes everything brighter
BKOB-2||oh fly and never tire fly and never Tire fly and never Tire there's a great camp meeting in the Promised Land
BKOB-3||from an African American spiritual don't discount our powers
BKOB-4||we have made a pass at the infinite Robert Frost
BKOB-6||I began reading this book shortly after the end of my presidency
BKOB-7||after Michelle and I had boarded Air Force One for the last time and traveled West
BKOB-8||for a long deferred break the mood on the plane was bittersweet
BKOB-9||both of us were drained physically and emotionally
BKOB-10||not only by the labors of the previous eight years but by the unexpected results of an election in which someone diametrically opposed to everything we stood for had been chosen as my successor
BKOB-11||still having run our leg of the race to completion we took satisfaction in knowing that we'd done our very best
BKOB-12||and that however much I'd Fallen short as president whatever projects I'd hoped but failed to accomplish
BKOB-13||the country was in better shape now than it had been when I'd started
BKOB-14||for a month Michelle and I slept late ate leisurely dinners
BKOB-15||went for long walks swam in the ocean took stock replenished our friendship rediscovered our love
BKOB-16||and planned for a less eventful but hopefully no less satisfying second act
BKOB-17||and by the time I was ready to get back to work and sat down with a pen and Yellow pad
BKOB-18||I still like writing things out in longhand finding the computer gives even my roughest drafts too smooth a gloss and blends half-baked thoughts the mask of tidiness
BKOB-19||I had a clear outline of the book in my head first and foremost I hope to give an honest rendering of my time in office
BKOB-20||not just a historical record of key events that happened on my watch and important figures with whom I interacted but also an account of some of the political economic and cultural crosscurrents that help determine the challenges my Administration faced and the choices my team and I made in response
BKOB-21||where possible I wanted to offer readers a sense of what it's like to be the president of United States
BKOB-22||I want to pull the curtain back a bit and remind people that for all its power and pump
BKOB-23||the presidency is still just a job and our federal government is a human Enterprise like any other
BKOB-24||and the men and women who work in the White House experience the same daily mixes satisfy
BKOB-25||disappointment office friction screw-ups and small triumphs as the rest of their fellow citizens
BKOB-26||finally I want to tell a more personal story that might Inspire young people considering a life of Public Service
BKOB-27||how my career in politics really started with a search for a place to fit in weight explain the different strands of my mixed up heritage
BKOB-28||and how it was only by hitching my wagon to something larger than myself
BKOB-29||but I was also able to locate a community
BKOB-30||and purpose for my life I figured I could do all that maybe 500 pages
BKOB-31||expected to be done in a year it's fair to say that the writing process
BKOB-32||despite my best intentions the book kept growing in length and scope
BKOB-33||reason why I've actually decided to break it into two volumes
BKOB-34||I'm painfully aware that the more gifted writer could have found a way to tell the same story
BKOB-35||with greater brevity after all my home office in the White House that right next to the Lincoln bedroom or a signed copy of the 272-word Gettysburg Address rest beneath a glass case
BKOB-36||but each time I sat down to write whether it was to describe the early phases of my campaign
BKOB-37||or my administration's handling of the financial crisis or negotiations with the Russians on nuclear arms control
BKOB-38||or the forces that led to the Arab Spring I found my mind resisting a simple linear narrative
BKOB-39||often I felt obliged to provide context for the decisions I and others have made
BKOB-40||and I didn't want to relegate that background to footnotes or endnotes
BKOB-41||I hate footnotes and endnotes I discovered that I couldn't always explain my motivations just by referencing reams of economic data or recalling and exhausted Oval Office briefing
BKOB-42||but they've been shaped by a conversation I had with a stranger on the campaign Trail
BKOB-43||a visit to a military hospital or childhood lesson might received years earlier for my mother
BKOB-44||repeatedly my memories with toss-up seemingly incidental detail
BKOB-45||trying to find a discreet location to grab an evening smoke
BKOB-46||my staff and I having a laugh while playing cards aboard Air Force One
BKOB-47||that captured in a way the public record never could my lived experience during the eight years I've been in the White House
BKOB-48||beyond the struggle to put words on a page when I didn't fully anticipate was the way events would unfold during the three-and-a-half years after that last flight on Air Force One
BKOB-49||as I sit here the country remains in the grips of a global pandemic and the accompanying economic crisis
BKOB-50||with more than 178,000 Americans dead
BKOB-51||businesses shuttered and millions of people out of work
BKOB-52||Across the Nation people from all walks of life have poured into the streets to protest the deaths of unarmed black men and women at the hands of the
BKOB-53||perhaps most troubling of all our democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of crisis
BKOB-54||crisis rooted in a fundamental contest between two opposing visions of what America is and what it should be
BKOB-55||a crisis that has left the body politic divided angry and mistrustful
BKOB-56||and has allowed for an ongoing breach of institutional Norms procedural safeguards
BKOB-57||and the adherence to basic facts to both Republicans and Democrats once took for granted
BKOB-58||this contest is not new course in many ways it has defined the American Experience
BKOB-59||it's embedded in founding documents that could simultaneously Proclaim all men equal in the account as slaves as three-fifths of a man
BKOB-60||it finds expression in our earliest Court opinions is one the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court bluntly explains to Native Americans that their tribes rights to convey property aren't enforceable since the core
BKOB-61||conqueror has no capacity to recognize the just claims of the Conquered
BKOB-62||its a contest thats been fought on the fields of Gettysburg and Appomattox
BKOB-63||but also in Halls of Congress on a bridge in Selma
BKOB-64||Across The Vineyards of California and down the streets of New York
BKOB-65||a contest fought by soldiers but more often by Union organizers
BKOB-66||suffragists Pullman Porters student leaders waves of immigrants and lgbtq activists armed with nothing more than picket signs pamphlets
BKOB-67||or a pair of marching shoes at the heart of this long-running battle is a simple question
BKOB-68||do we care to match the reality of America to its ideals
BKOB-69||if so do we really believe that our Notions of self-government and individual freedom
BKOB-70||equality of opportunity and equality before the law
BKOB-71||apply to everybody
BKOB-72||are we instead committed in practice if not in statute
BKOB-73||preserving those things for a privileged few
BKOB-74||I recognize that there are those who believe that it's time to discard the myth
BKOB-75||an examination of America's past
BKOB-76||and an even cursory glance at today's headlines show that this nation's ideals have always been secondary to Conquest and subjugation a racial caste system and rapacious capitalism
BKOB-77||I'm at the pretend otherwise it to be complicit in a game that was rigged from the start
BKOB-78||and I confess that there have been times during the course of writing this book
BKOB-79||cuz I reflected on my presidency and all that's happened since
BKOB-80||when I've had to ask myself whether I was to temper and speaking the truth is I thought
BKOB-81||too cautious in either word or deed
BKOB-82||convinced as I was to buy a peeling to what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature I stood a greater chance of leading Us in the direction of the America
BKOB-84||what I can say for certain is that I'm not yet ready to abandon the possibility of America
BKOB-85||Not just for the sake of future generations of Americans
BKOB-86||but for all of humankind for I'm convinced that the pandemic we're currently living through is both a manifestation of
BKOB-87||and a mere interruption in the Relentless March towards an interconnected world
BKOB-88||one with peoples and cultures can't help but collide
BKOB-89||in that world of Global Supply chains instantaneous Capital transfers social media transnational terrorist networks climate-change mass migration and ever-increasing complexity
BKOB-90||you will learn to live together cooperate with one another
BKOB-91||and recognize the Dignity of others or we will perish
BKOB-92||and so the world watches America the only great power in history made up of
BKOB-93||people from every corner of the planet comprising every race and faith and cultural practice
BKOB-94||to see if our experiment in democracy can work
BKOB-95||to see if we can do what no other nation has ever done
BKOB-96||to see if we can actually live up to the meaning of our creed
BKOB-97||the jury's still out by the time its first volume of public and US election will have taken place
BKOB-98||and while I believe the stakes could not be higher
BKOB-99||I also know that no single election will settle the matter
BKOB-100||if I remain hopeful because I've learned to place my faith in my fellow citizens
BKOB-101||especially those of the next-generation whose conviction than the equal worth of all people seems to come as second nature
BKOB-102||and who insist on making real those principles that their parents and teachers told them were true
BKOB-103||but perhaps never fully believed themselves more than anyone
BKOB-104||this book is for those young people
BKOB-105||an invitation to once again remake the world
BKOB-106||and the bring about two hard work determination and a big dose of imagination
BKOB-107||an America that finally aligns with all that is best in US
BKOB-108||August 2020 part 1
BKOB-110||of all the rooms and halls and landmarks that make up the White House and its grounds it was a west colonnade that I love best
BKOB-111||for eight years that walkway would frame my day a minute-long open-air commute from home to office and Back Again
BKOB-112||it was where each morning I felt the first flap of Winter Wind or pulse of summer heat
BKOB-113||the place where I gather my thoughts taking through the meetings that lie ahead
BKOB-114||during Arguments for skeptical members of con
BKOB-115||anxious constituents girding myself for this decision or that slow-rolling crisis
BKOB-116||in the earliest days the White House the Executive offices in the first family's residence fit Under One Roof and the West Colonnade was little more than a path to the horse stables
BKOB-117||Teddy Roosevelt came in the office he determined that a single building couldn't accommodate a modern staff six boisterous children and his sanity
BKOB-118||he ordered the construction of what would become the west wing and Oval Office and over decades since successive presidencies the Colonnades current configuration emerged a bracket to the Rose Garden north and west
BKOB-119||the thick wall on the North side mute and unadorned save for high Halfmoon windows
BKOB-120||the stately white columns on the westside like an honor guard ensuring safe Passage
BKOB-121||as a general rule I'm a slow Walker a Hawaiian walk Michelle likes to say sometimes with a hint of impatience
BKOB-122||I walk differently though on the colonnade conscious of the history that been made there and those who had proceed me
BKOB-123||my strikeout longer my steps a bit brisk
BKOB-124||my footfall on Stone echoed by the Secret Service detail trailing me a few yards back
BKOB-125||when I reach the ramp at the end of The Colonnade the legacy of FDR in his wheelchair that picture I'm smiling chin out cigarette holder clenched tight in his teeth is he strains to roll up incline
BKOB-126||I'd wave at the uniformed guard just inside the glass pane door
BKOB-127||sometimes regard will be holding back a surprise block of visitors
BKOB-128||if I have time I would shake their hands and ask where they were from
BKOB-129||usually though I just turned left following the outer wall of the cabinet room and slipping into the side door by the Oval Office where I greeted my personal staff for at my schedule and a cup of hot tea
BKOB-130||and started the business of the day several times a week I would step out onto the colonnade to find the groundskeepers all employee
BKOB-131||the National Park Service working in the Rose Garden
BKOB-132||they were older men mostly dressed in green khaki uniforms sometimes match with a floppy hat to block the Sun or bulky coat against the cold
BKOB-133||if I wasn't running late I might stop to compliment them on the fresh planting sir asked about the Damage Done by the previous night's storm
BKOB-134||let explain their work with quiet Pride ever met a few words
BKOB-135||even with one another they made the points with a gesture or a nod
BKOB-136||each of them focused on his individual task but all of them moving with a synchronized Grace
BKOB-137||one of the oldest was Ed Thomas that's all wiry black man with sunken cheeks with worked at the White House for fourty years
BKOB-138||first time I met him he reached into his back pocket for a cloth to wipe off the dirt before shaking my hand
BKOB-139||his hand thick with knots like the roots of a tree engulfed mine
BKOB-140||that's how much longer intended to stay the white house before taking his retirement
BKOB-141||I do miss present he said I like to work
BKOB-142||get little hard on the joints but I reckon I might stay as long as you are here
BKOB-143||make sure the garden looks good oh how good that Garden look
BKOB-144||the Shady Magnolias Rising high at Each corner
BKOB-145||Hedges thick and rich green the crabapple trees pruned just so
BKOB-146||and the flowers cultivated greenhouses a few miles away providing a constant explosion of color
BKOB-147||Reds and yellows and pinks and purples
BKOB-148||in spring tulips Masten bunches their heads tilted toward the Sun
BKOB-149||in summer lavender heliotrope and geraniums in lilies
BKOB-150||in fall chrysanthemums and daisies and wildflowers
BKOB-151||always a few roses red mostly but sometimes yellow or white
BKOB-152||each one flush in its Bloom each time I walk down the Colonnade or looked out the window the Oval Office
BKOB-153||the handy work for the men and women who worked outside
BKOB-154||they reminded me of a small Norman Rockwell painting I kept on the wall next to the portrait of George Washington and above the bust of Dr. King
BKOB-155||5 tiny figures varying skin tones workingmen in dungarees
BKOB-156||hoisted up by ropes into a crisp Bluesky to polish the lamp of Lady Liberty
BKOB-157||the men in the painting The groundskeepers in the garden
BKOB-158||they were Guardians I thought the quite Priests of a good and solemn order
BKOB-159||I would tell myself that I needed to work as hard and take as much care in my job as they did in theres
BKOB-160||what time I walk down the colonnade would accumulate with memorys
BKOB-161||with a big public events of course announcements made before a Phalanx of cameras press conferences with foreign leaders
BKOB-162||but they were also the moments few others saw Malia and Sasha racing each other to greet me on a surprise afternoon visit
BKOB-163||or our dogs bowling Sunny bounding through the snow
BKOB-164||pause syncing so deep that The Chins were bearded White
BKOB-165||tossing footballs on a bright fall day or comforting and made after personal hardship
BKOB-166||such images would often flashed through my mind interrupting whatever calculations were occupying me
BKOB-167||they reminded me of time passing sometimes filling me with longing
BKOB-168||desire to turn back the clock and begin again
BKOB-169||this wasn't possible on my morning walk for time's Arrow moved only forward then
BKOB-170||the day's work beckoned I needed to focus on only those things to come
BKOB-171||the night was different on the evening walk back to the residence my briefcase stuffed with papers
BKOB-172||I would try to slow myself down sometimes even stop
BKOB-173||I breathe are laced with the scent of soil and grass and pollen
BKOB-174||and listen to the wind of the patter of rain I sometimes stared at the light against the
BKOB-175||the Regal master the White House the flag Aloft on the roof lit bright
BKOB-176||I look toward the Washington Monument piercing the black sky in the distance occasionally catching sight of the moon and stars above it
BKOB-177||or the twinkling of a passing jet in moments like these I would wonder if the strange path
BKOB-178||and the idea that it brought me to this place
BKOB-179||I don't come from a political family my maternal grandparents were midwesterners from mostly scots-irish.
BKOB-180||they would have been considered liberal especially by the standards of the depression-era Kansas towns they were born in and they were diligent about keeping up with the news
BKOB-181||it's part of being a well-informed citizen my grandmother whom we all called tute short for tootoo or grandma in Hawaiian what tell me. Over the top of her morning Honolulu Advertiser
BKOB-182||but she and my grandfather had no firm ideological or partisan
BKOB-183||Livingston speak out of beyond what they considered to be common sense
BKOB-184||I thought about work my grandmother was vice-president of escrow at one of the local banks my grandfather life insurance salesman and paying the bills and the small diversions that life had to offer
BKOB-185||and anyway they lived Oahu where nothing seemed that urgent
BKOB-186||after years spent in places as disparate has Oklahoma Texas and Washington State
BKOB-187||they finally moved to Hawaii in 1960 a year after its statehood was established
BKOB-188||a big ocean now separated them from riots and protests and other such things
BKOB-189||the only political conversation I can recall my grandparents having while I was growing up had to do with a Beachside bar
BKOB-190||Honolulu's mayor had torn down Grandpa's favorite Watering Hole in order to renovate the beachfront at the far end Waikiki
BKOB-191||Gramps never forgave him for it my mother and Dunham was different
BKOB-192||strong opinion my grandpa
BKOB-193||Sweet Child she rebelled against convention in high school reading beatnik poets and French existentialist joyriding with a friend to San Francisco 4 days without telling anyone
BKOB-194||the kid I just hear from her about civil rights marches why the Vietnam War was a misguided disaster
BKOB-195||about the women's movement yes unequal pay not as keen on not shaving her legs and the war on poverty
BKOB-196||when we move to Indonesia to live with my stepfather she made sure to explain the sins of government corruption
BKOB-197||just stealing barry even if everyone appeared to be doing
BKOB-198||later during the summer I turned twelve when we went on a month-long family vacation traveling across the United States she insisted we watched the Watergate hearings every night
BKOB-199||providing her own running commentary what do you expect from a McCarthy
BKOB-200||she didn't just focus on headlines either once when she discovered I've been part of a group that was teasing
BKOB-201||kid at school she sat me down in front of her lips pursed with dissapointment
BKOB-202||you know barry she said that's the nickname that she and my grandparents used for me when I was growing up often shortened to bear
BKOB-203||are people in the world who think only about themselves
BKOB-204||They don't care what happens to other people so long as they get what they want
BKOB-205||they put other people down to make themselves feel important
BKOB-206||Then there are people who do the opposite were able to imagine how others must feel and make sure that they don't do things that hurt people
BKOB-207||so she said looking at me squarely in the eye which got a person do you want to be
BKOB-208||I felt lousy as she intended it to
BKOB-209||her question stayed with me for a long time for my mother the world was full of opportunities for moral instruction
BKOB-210||but I never knew her to get involved in a political campaign
BKOB-211||like my grandparents she was suspicious of platforms doctrines Absolutes preferring to Express her values on a small
BKOB-212||or canvas complicated bear that's why it's interesting
BKOB-213||just made by the war in Southeast Asia she ended up spending most of her life
BKOB-214||absorbing the language and culture setting up microlending programs for people in poverty long before microcredit became trendy in international development
BKOB-215||appalled by racism she would marry outside her race not once but twice
BKOB-216||and go on to Lavish what seemed like an inexhaustible love
BKOB-217||on her two Brown children incensed by societal constraints put-upon women she divorced both men when they proved overbearing or disappointing
BKOB-218||carving out a career of her own choosing raising her kids according to her own standards of decency and pretty much doing whatever she damn well pleased
BKOB-219||in my mother's world the personal really was political now that she would have had much use for the slogan
BKOB-220||none of this is to say that she lacked ambition for her son
BKOB-221||despite the financial strain she and my grandparents would send me to Punahou a wise top Prep School
BKOB-222||the thought of me not going to college was never entertained
BKOB-223||but no one in my family would have ever suggested I might hold public office someday
BKOB-224||if you'd asked my mother she might have imagined that I'd end up heading of philanthropic institution like the Ford Foundation
BKOB-225||my grandparents would've love to see me become a judge or a great courtroom lawyer like Perry Mason
BKOB-226||might as well put that smart-mouthed of his to use Gramps would say
BKOB-227||since I didn't know my father he didn't have much input
BKOB-228||I vaguely understood that he had worked for the Kenyan government for a Time
BKOB-229||and when I was ten he traveled from Kenya to stay with us for a month in Honolulu
BKOB-230||That was the first and last I saw him after that I heard from only through the occasional letter
BKOB-231||written on thin blue air mail paper that was pre-printed to fold an address without an envelope
BKOB-232||your mother tells me you think you may want to study architecture
BKOB-234||this is a very practical profession that one that can be practiced anywhere in the world
BKOB-235||it was not much to go on as for the world beyond my family well what they would see for most of my teenage years was not a budding leader but rather the lackadaisical student
BKOB-236||passionate basketball player of limited Talent
BKOB-237||and an incessant dedicated partier no student government for me no Eagle Scouts are interning at the local congressman's office
BKOB-238||through High School my friends and I didn't discuss much Beyond sports girls music and plans for getting loaded
BKOB-239||three of these guys Bobby titcomb Greg Norman Mike Ramos remain some of my closest friends
BKOB-240||to this day we can laugh for hours over stories of our misspent youth
BKOB-241||later years they would throw themselves into my campaigns with a loyalty for which I will always be grateful
BKOB-242||becoming a skilled at defending my record as anyone on MSNBC
BKOB-243||they're also time during my presidency
BKOB-244||after they'd watch me speak to a big crowd say or receive a series of crisp salutes from Young Marines during a base tour when their faces would betray a certain bafflement
BKOB-245||as if they were trying to reconcile the greying man in a suit and tie would be ill-defined Manchild they'd once known
BKOB-246||they must have said it themselves
BKOB-247||how the hell did that happen and if my friends would ever ask me directly I'm not sure I'd have had a good answer
BKOB-248||I do know that sometime in high school I started asking questions
BKOB-249||by my father's absence in my mother's choices
BKOB-250||about how it was but I come to live in a place where few people look like me
BKOB-251||a lot of questions centered on Race why did blacks play professional basketball but not coach it
BKOB-252||what did that girl from school mean when she said she didn't think of me as black
BKOB-253||why were all the black men in action movies switchblade wielding lunatics except for maybe the one
BKOB-254||black guy the sidekick of course who always seem to end up getting killed
BKOB-255||but I wasn't only concerned with race it was class as well
BKOB-256||growing up in Indonesia I'd seen the yawning Chasm between the lives of wealthy Elites and impoverished masses
BKOB-257||I had to Mason awareness of the tribal tensions in my father's country
BKOB-258||the hatred that could exist between those who on the surface might look the same
BKOB-259||I bore daily witness to the seemingly cramped lives of my grandparents
BKOB-260||the disappointments they filled with TV and liquor in sometimes a new Appliance or car
BKOB-261||I noticed that my mother paid for intellectual Freedom with chronic Financial struggles and occasional personal chaos
BKOB-262||And I became attuned to the not-so-subtle hierarchies among my Prep School classmates
BKOB-263||mostly having to do with how much money their parents had and then there was the unsettling fact that despite whatever my mother might claim
BKOB-264||the bullies cheats and self-promoters seem to be doing quite well
BKOB-265||although she considered good and decent people seem to get screwed an awful lot
BKOB-266||all of this pulled me in different directions it was because of the very strangeness of my Heritage and the world's I straddled
BKOB-267||I was from everywhere and nowhere at once a combination of ill-fitting Parts like a platypus or some imaginary Beast confined to a fragile habitat unsure where I belong
BKOB-268||and I sensed without fully understanding why or how
BKOB-269||unless I could Stitch my life together and situate myself along some firm axis I might end up in some basic way living my life alone
BKOB-270||I didn't talk to anyone about this certainly not my friends are family
BKOB-271||I didn't want to hurt their feelings or stand out anymore than I already did
BKOB-272||I did find refuge in books the reading habit was my mother's doing instilled early in my childhood
BKOB-273||go to move anytime I complained of boredom or when she couldn't afford to send me to the international school in Indonesia or when I'd accompany her to the office because she's never babysitter
BKOB-274||she would say then come back and tell me something you learned
BKOB-275||there were a few years when I lived with my grandparents in Hawaii when my mother continued to work in Indonesia and raise my younger sister Maya
BKOB-276||without my mother around to nag me I didn't learned as much as my grades regularly a test
BKOB-277||been around 10th grade that change
BKOB-278||I still remember going with my grandparents to a rummage sale at the central union church across the street from our apartment and finding myself in front of a bin of old hardcover books
BKOB-279||for some reason I started pulling up titles that appealed to me or sounded Vaguely Familiar
BKOB-280||books by Ralph Ellison in Langston Hughes Robert Penn Warren and Dostoevsky
BKOB-281||DH Lawrence Ralph Waldo Emerson
BKOB-282||Gramps was eyeing a set of used golf clubs gave me a confused look when I walked up with my box of books
BKOB-283||planning to open a library my grandmother shushed finding my sudden interest in literature Admiral
BKOB-284||ever practical she did suggest I might want to focus on my class assignments before digging into crime and punishment
BKOB-285||I ended up reading all those books sometimes late after I got home from basketball practice in the six pack with my friends sometimes after body surfing on a Saturday afternoon sitting alone in grams is rickety old Ford Granada with a towel around my waist to avoid getting the upholstery wet
BKOB-286||when I finished the first set of books I went through other rummage sales looking for more
BKOB-287||much of what I read I only dimly understood
BKOB-288||I took the circling unfamiliar words to look up in the dictionary now though I was less scrupulous about decoding pronunciations
BKOB-289||deep into my twenties I would know the meaning of words I could not pronounce
BKOB-290||there's no system to this no Rhyme or pattern
BKOB-291||I was like a young tinkerer in my garage Gathering up old cathode-ray tubes and bolts and loose wires
BKOB-292||not sure what I do with any of it but convinced it would prove handy once I figured out the nature of my calling
BKOB-293||my interest in books probably explains why I not only survived high school but arrived at Occidental College in 1979 with a thin but passable knowledge of political issues and a series of half-baked opinions that I toss out during late-night bull sessions in the dorm
BKOB-294||looking back it's embarrassing to recognize the degree to which my intellectual curiosity those first two years in college paralleled the interests of various women I was attempting to get to know
BKOB-295||mark-to-market losses so I had something to say that long-legged socialist who lived in my dorm
BKOB-296||Gwendolyn Brooks for the smooth skin sociology major who never gave me a second look
BKOB-297||Cohen wolf for the Ethereal bisexual who wore mostly black
BKOB-298||as a strategy for picking up girls my pseudo intellectualism
BKOB-299||proved mostly worthless I found myself in a series of affectionate but chased friendships
BKOB-300||still these halting efforts serve a purpose
BKOB-301||something approaching a worldview took shape in my mind
BKOB-302||I was helped Along by a handful of professors who tolerated my iffy study habits and my youthful pretension
BKOB-303||I was helped even more by a handful of mostly older students
BKOB-304||black kids from the inner-city white kids who would scratch their way into college from small towns first-generation Latino kids International students from Pakistan or India or countries in Africa that teetered on the edge of Chaos
BKOB-305||They Knew What mattered to them when they spoke in class their views were routed natural communities actual struggles
BKOB-306||here's what these budget cuts mean in my neighborhood
BKOB-307||let me tell you about my school before you complain about the formative Act
BKOB-308||the first amendment is great but why does the US government say nothing about the political prisoners in my country
BKOB-309||the two years I spent at Occidental represented the start of my political awakening
BKOB-311||your actors in a rigged game I decided that I wanted no part of
BKOB-312||what did capture my attention was something broader and less conventional
BKOB-313||not political campaigns but social movements where ordinary people join together to make change
BKOB-314||I became a student of the sufferagists and early labor organizers of Gandhi and like valessa
BKOB-315||and the African National Congress most of all I was inspired by the young leaders of the Civil Rights move
BKOB-316||not just doctor king but John Lewis and Bob Moses Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash
BKOB-317||in their heroic efforts going door-to-door to registered voters sitting down at lunch counters and marching to freedom songs
BKOB-318||I saw the possibility of practicing the values my mother had taught
BKOB-319||how you can build power not by putting others down but by lifting them up
BKOB-320||this was true democracy at work Democracy not as a gift from on high or division of spoils between interest groups but rather democracy that was earned
BKOB-321||the work of everybody the result was not just a change in material conditions by a sense of dignity for people and communities
BKOB-322||a bond between those two at once seemed far apart
BKOB-323||this I decided was my deal worth pursuing
BKOB-324||I just need to focus at my sophomore year I transferred to Columbia University figuring it would be a new start
BKOB-325||for three years in New York hold up in a series of delays
BKOB-326||gated Apartments largely shorn of old friends and bad habits I lived like a monk
BKOB-327||Reading Writing filling up journals rarely bothering with college parties or even eating hot meals
BKOB-328||I got lost in my head preoccupied with questions that seemed to layer themselves one over the next
BKOB-329||what made some movements succeed where others failed
BKOB-330||was it a sign of success when portions of a cause were absorbed by conventional politics
BKOB-331||or was it a sign that the cause has been hijacked
BKOB-332||when was compromise acceptable and when was it selling out
BKOB-333||how did one know the difference oh how earnest I was then how Fierce and humorless
BKOB-334||when I look back on my journal entries from this time I feel a great affection for the young man that I was aching to make a mark on the world
BKOB-335||wanted to be part of something Grand and idealistic which evidence seems to indicate did not exist
BKOB-336||this is America in the early 1980s after all
BKOB-337||social movements the previous decade has lost her vibrancy
BKOB-338||a new conservatism was taking old Ronald Reagan was President the economy was in recession
BKOB-339||cold war was in full swing if I were to travel back in time I might urge the young man I was to set the books aside for a minute open the windows and let in some fresh air
BKOB-340||my smoking habit was then in full bloom and tell him to relax go meet some people enjoy the pleasures that life reserves for those in their 20s
BKOB-341||the few friends I had a New York tried to offer similar advice
BKOB-342||you need to lighten up Barack you need to get laid
BKOB-343||you're so idealistic is great but I don't know if what you're saying is really possible
BKOB-344||I resisted these voices I resisted precisely because I fear that they were right
BKOB-345||whatever I was incubating during those hours spent alone whatever vision for Better World I'd let flourish in the Hothouse of
BKOB-346||youthful mind it could hardly withstand even a simple conversational road test
BKOB-347||the great light of a Manhattan winter that against the overarching cynicism of the times
BKOB-348||my ideas spoken aloud in class or over coffee with friends came off as fanciful and far-fetched
BKOB-349||I knew it in fact it's one of the things that may have saved me from becoming a full-blown crank before I reach the age of 22
BKOB-350||some basic level I understood the absurdity of my vision
BKOB-351||how wide the Gap was between my grand Ambitions and anything I was actually doing in my life
BKOB-352||Walter Mitty a Don Quixote with no Sancho Panza
BKOB-353||this too can be found my journal entries from that time
BKOB-354||accurate Chronicle of all my shortcomings
BKOB-355||my preference for navel-gazing overaction ascertain Reserve even shyness traceable perhaps to my Hawaiian and Indonesian upbringing but also the result of a deep self-conscious
BKOB-356||a sensitivity to rejection or looking stupid
BKOB-357||maybe even a fundamental laziness I took it upon myself to purge the softness with a regimen of self-improvement that I've never entirely shed
BKOB-358||Michelle and the girls point out that to this day I can't get into a pool or the ocean without feeling compelled to swim laps
BKOB-359||why don't you just Wade they'll say with a Snicker it's fun here will show you how
BKOB-360||I made lists I started working out going for runs around the Central Park Reservoir along the East River and eating cans of tuna fish and hard boiled eggs for fuel
BKOB-361||strip myself of excess belongings who needs more than 5 shirts
BKOB-362||what great contest was I preparing for whatever it was I knew I was not ready
BKOB-363||certainty that self-doubt kept me from settling too quickly on easy answers
BKOB-364||I got in the habit of questioning my own assumptions
BKOB-365||and this I think ultimately came in handy not only because it prevented me from becoming insufferable but because it inoculated me against the Revolutionary formulas embraced by a lot of people on the left at the dawn of the Reagan Era
BKOB-366||certainly that was true when it came to questions of race
BKOB-367||experienced my fair share of racial sleights and could see all too well the enduring Legacy of slavery and Jim Crow anytime I walk through Harlem or parts of the Bronx
BKOB-368||but identify ography I learned not to claim my own victimhood to readily
BKOB-369||I resisted the notion held by some of the black folks I knew that white people were irredeemably racist
BKOB-370||the conviction that racism was an inevitable may also explain my willingness to defend the American idea
BKOB-371||what country was and what it could become my mother and grandparents have never been noisy in their patriotism
BKOB-372||reciting the pledge of allegiance in class waiving small flags on 4th of July
BKOB-373||These were treated as pleasant rituals not sacred duties
BKOB-374||attitude towards Easter and Christmas were pretty much the same
BKOB-375||even gramps service in world war two was downplayed he told me more about eating K rations
BKOB-376||Benny ever told me about the glory of marching and Patton's Army
BKOB-377||and yet the pride and being American the notion that America was the greatest country on Earth
BKOB-378||that was always a given as a young man I chased against books that dismissed the notion of American exceptionalism
BKOB-379||got in the long-drawn-out arguments with friends who insisted the American hegemon was the root of Oppression worldwide
BKOB-380||I've lived overseas I Knew Too Much
BKOB-381||America fell perpetually short of its ideals I readily conceded
BKOB-382||the version of American History taught in schools with slavery glossed over in the slaughter of Native Americans all but omitted
BKOB-383||that I did not defend the blundering exercise of military power.
BKOB-384||rapaciousness of multinationals yeah yeah I got all that
BKOB-385||but the idea of America America
BKOB-386||this I clung to with a stubbornness that surprised even me
BKOB-387||we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that was my America
BKOB-388||the America tocqueville wrote about the countryside of Whitman and throw with no person my inferior or my better
BKOB-389||the American of Pioneers heading west in search of a better life or immigrants landing on Ellis Island propelled by a yearning for freedom
BKOB-390||it was the American Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers making dreams take flight
BKOB-391||Jackie Robinson stealing home is Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan
BKOB-392||Billie Holiday at the Village Vanguard Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison
BKOB-393||all those Misfits took the scraps that others overlooked or discarded and made Beauty no one had seen before
BKOB-394||the America of Lincoln at Gettysburg and Jane Addams toiling in a Chicago settlement home and weary gi's at Normandy
BKOB-395||dr. King on the National Mall some encouraging others and in himself
BKOB-396||was the Constitution and the Bill of Rights crafted by flawed but brilliant thinkers who reason their way to A system that wants sturdy and capable of change
BKOB-397||an America that could explain me dream on Barack beside these arguments with my college friends would usually end
BKOB-398||some smug bastard dropped a newspaper in front of me it's headlines trumpeting the US Invasion of Grenada or Cuts in the school lunch program or some other disheartening news
BKOB-399||sorry but that's your America
BKOB-400||such was my state when I graduate 1983
BKOB-401||Big Ideas and nowhere to go there were no movements to join no selfless leader to follow
BKOB-402||closest I could find what I had in mind was something called Community organizing
BKOB-403||Grassroots work the broad ordinary people together around issues of local concern
BKOB-404||after bouncing around in a couple of ill fitting jobs in New York
BKOB-405||I heard about division in Chicago working with a group of churches were trying to stabilize communities rack by steel plant closures
BKOB-406||nothing Grand or place I've recorded elsewhere my organizing years in Chicago
BKOB-407||victories were small and transitory in the mostly black working-class neighborhoods where I spent my time
BKOB-408||organization was a big player in its attempts to address the changes were sweeping not just Chicago but cities across the country
BKOB-409||the decline in manufacturing white flight
BKOB-410||the rise of a discrete and disconnected underclass even as a new knowledge class began the fuel gentrification in the urban core
BKOB-411||but if my own impact on Chicago was small the city change the Arc of my life
BKOB-412||for starters it got me out of my own head
BKOB-413||I had to listen to and I just feel right about what matter to people
BKOB-414||I'd ask strangers to join me and one another on real-life projects
BKOB-415||fixing up a Park or removing asbestos from a housing project for starting an after-school program
BKOB-416||experienced failure and learn the back up so I can rally those who put their trust in me
BKOB-417||I suffered rejections and insults often enough to stop fearing them
BKOB-418||in other words I grew up and got my sense of humor back
BKOB-419||I came to love the men and women I worked with the single mom living on a ravaged block we somehow got all four children through college
BKOB-420||the irish priest who threw open the church doors every evening so the kids had an option other than gangs
BKOB-421||laid-off steelworker who went back to school to become a social worker
BKOB-422||their stories of hardship and their modest victories confirm for me again and again the basic decency of people
BKOB-423||through them I saw the transformation that took place when citizens held their leaders and institutions to account
BKOB-424||even on something as small as putting in a stop sign on a busy corner or getting more police patrols
BKOB-425||I noticed how people stood up a little straighter saw themselves differently when they learned their voices matter
BKOB-426||through them I resolved the lingering questions of my racial identity for turned out that there was no single way to be black just trying to be a good man was enough
BKOB-427||through them I discovered a Community of Faith it was okay to doubt to question and still read for something beyond the Here and Now
BKOB-428||and because I heard in church basements and on Bungalow porches the very same values
BKOB-429||honesty and hard work and empathy
BKOB-430||it had been drilled Into Me by my mother and grandparents
BKOB-431||I came to trust the Common Thread that existed between people
BKOB-432||I can't help but wonder sometimes what would have happened if I'd stayed
BKOB-433||organizer or at least some version of it
BKOB-434||like many Local Heroes I've met over the years I might have managed to build up an institution that could reshape a neighborhood for portion of the city
BKOB-435||anchored deep in a community I might have steered money in imagination to change not the world but just that one place for that one set of kids
BKOB-436||doing work that touched the lives of neighbors and friends in some measurable and Youthful way
BKOB-437||but I didn't stay I left for Harvard Law School
BKOB-438||and here's where the story gets murkier in my mind
BKOB-439||with my motives open to interpretation I told myself then and I like to tell myself still but I left organizing because I saw the work I was doing is too slow
BKOB-440||too limited not able to match the needs of the people that I hope to serve
BKOB-441||local job training center couldn't make up for thousands of Steel jobs lost by a plant closing
BKOB-442||an after-school program could compensate for chronically underfunded schools or kids raised by their grandparents because both parents for doing time
BKOB-443||every issue it seemed we kept bumping up against somebody a politician a bureaucrat some distant CEO who had the power to make things better but didn't
BKOB-444||and when we did get concessions from them is most often too little too late
BKOB-445||the power to shape budgets and guide policy was what we needed
BKOB-446||and that power lay elsewhere moreover I came to realize that just two years before I arrived there had been a movement for change in Chicago
BKOB-447||one that was both social and political deep swiftcurrent that I had failed to fully appreciate because it hadn't conformed to my theories
BKOB-448||was the movement to elect Harold Washington the city's first black mayor
BKOB-449||seems like it's spring out of nowhere as Grassroots a political campaign as anything modern politics had ever seen
BKOB-450||small band black activist and Business Leaders tired of The Chronic bias and inequities of America's most segregated big city
BKOB-451||decided to register a record number of Voters then drafted a rotund Congressman of prodigious talent but limited ambition to run for an office that appeared well Out Of Reach
BKOB-452||nobody thought it had a chance even Harold was skeptical
BKOB-453||the campaign operating hand-to-mouth staff largely by an experienced volunteers
BKOB-454||then it happened some form of spontaneous combustion
BKOB-455||people who would never thought about politics people who had never even voted got swept up in the cause
BKOB-456||seniors and schoolchildren started supporting the campaign blue buttons
BKOB-457||Collective unwillingness to keep putting up with a steady accumulation of unfairness and sleights all the bogus traffic stops in second-hand textbooks all the time black folks walk pass to park district field house on the north side and noticed how much
BKOB-458||nicer it was than the one in their neighborhood all the times they've been passed over for promotions or denied bank loans
BKOB-459||gathered like a cyclone and toppled City Hall
BKOB-460||by the time I arrived in Chicago Harold was halfway through his first term
BKOB-461||the city council wants a rubber stamp for old man Deli and divided interracial camps a controlling majority-white Alderman blocking every reform that Harold proposed
BKOB-462||he tried to wheedle and cut deals but they wouldn't budge
BKOB-463||it was riveting television tribal and raw
BKOB-464||but it limited what Harold could deliver for those who'd elected him
BKOB-465||it took a federal court redrawing a racially gerrymandered automatic map for Harold to finally get the majority and break the deadlock
BKOB-466||and before he could realize many of the changes he promised
BKOB-467||he was dead of a heart attack a sign of the old order Rich daily ultimately regained his father's throne
BKOB-468||far from the center of the action I watched this drama unfold and try to absorb its lessons
BKOB-469||I saw how the tremendous energy the movement couldn't be sustained without structure organization and skills in governance
BKOB-470||I saw how a political campaign based on racial redress no matter how reasonable generated fear and backlash and ultimately placed limits on progress
BKOB-471||in the rapid collapse of Harold Coalition after his death
BKOB-472||I saw the danger of relying on a single charismatic leader to bring about change
BKOB-473||and yet what a force he was for those five years
BKOB-474||despite the roadblocks Chicago changed on his watch
BKOB-475||city services from tree-trimming to snow removal to Road repair came to be spread more evenly across wards
BKOB-476||new schools were built in poor neighborhoods city jobs were no longer subject soley to patronage and the business community at long last
BKOB-477||start paying attention to the lack of diversity in their ranks
BKOB-478||above all Harold gave people hope the way black Chicagoans talk about him in those years was reminiscent of how certain generation of white Progressives talk about Bobby Kennedy
BKOB-479||it wasn't so much what he did as how he made you feel
BKOB-480||anything was possible like the world was yours to remake
BKOB-481||for me this planted a seed it made me think for the first time that I wanted to someday run for public office
BKOB-482||I wasn't the only one that's inspired no shortly after Harry's election that Jesse Jackson would announce he was running for
BKOB-483||wasn't this where the energy of the civil rights movement had migrated into the Electoral politics
BKOB-484||John Lewis Andrew Young Julian Bond hadn't they run for office deciding this was the arena where they could make the most difference
BKOB-485||I knew they were pitfalls the compromises
BKOB-486||the money chase the losing track of ideals and the Relentless pursuit of winning
BKOB-487||maybe it was another way maybe you could generate the same energy the same sense of purpose
BKOB-488||not just within the black community but across racial lines
BKOB-489||maybe with enough preparation policy know-how and management skills you could avoid some of Heralds mistakes
BKOB-490||maybe the principles of organizing could be marshaled not just to run a campaign but to govern or encourage participation and active citizenship among those who had been left out
BKOB-491||and to teach them not just to trust their elected leaders but to trust one another
BKOB-492||and themselves that's what I told myself
BKOB-493||but it wasn't the whole story I was also struggling with narrower questions of my own ambitions
BKOB-494||much as I've learned from organizing I didn't have much to show for it in terms of concrete accomplishments
BKOB-495||my mother the woman who'd always marched to A Different Drummer worried about me
BKOB-496||I don't know bear she told me one Christmas you can spend a lifetime working outside institutions but you might get more done trying to change those institutions from the inside
BKOB-497||plus take it from me she said with a rueful laugh being broke is overrated
BKOB-498||so was that in the fall of 1988 I took my ambitions to a place where ambition hardly stood
BKOB-499||valedictorian student body president Latin Scholars debate champion
BKOB-500||people I found at Harvard Law School were generally impressive young men and women who unlike me had grown up with the justifiable conviction that they were destined to lead lives of consequence
BKOB-501||that I ended up doing well there I tribute mostly the fact that I was a few years older than my classmates
BKOB-502||where's many felt burdened by the workload for me days spent in the library or better yet on the couch with my off-campus apartment a ballgame
BKOB-503||on with the sound buted felt like an absolute luxury after three years of organizing Community meetings and knocking on doors in the cold
BKOB-504||there was also this the study of law turned out wasn't so different from what I done during my years of solitary musing on Civic questions
BKOB-505||what principle should govern the relationship between individual and society and how far did our obligations to others extend
BKOB-506||how much should the government regulate the market how does social change happen
BKOB-507||how can rules ensure that everybody has a voice
BKOB-508||I couldn't get enough of this stuff I loved the back and forth especially with the more conservative students who despite our disagreements seem to appreciate the fact that I took their argument seriously
BKOB-509||in classroom discussions my hand kept shooting up earning me some well-deserved eye rolls
BKOB-510||I couldn't help it it was as this after years of locking Myself Away with a strange obsession
BKOB-511||juggling say or sword swallowing I now found myself in Circus School
BKOB-512||enthusiasm makes up for a host of deficiencies I tell my daughters
BKOB-513||at least that was true for me at Harvard and my second year I was elected the first black head of the law review which generated a bit of national press
BKOB-514||I signed a contract to write a book job offers arrived from around the country
BKOB-515||it was assumed that my path was not charted just as it had been for my predecessors at the law review
BKOB-516||I'd clerk for Supreme Court Justice work for a top Law Firm or the office of the United States Attorney and when the time was right I could if I wanted to try my hand at politics
BKOB-517||it was heady stuff the only person who questioned the smooth path of ascent seemed to be me
BKOB-518||did come to quickly the big salaries being dangled the attention
BKOB-519||felt like a trap
BKOB-520||time to consider my next move and anyway the most important decision ahead would end up having nothing to do with law
BKOB-521||chapter two Michelle lavaughn Robinson was already practicing law
BKOB-522||she was twenty-five years old and an associate at sidley & Austin The chicago-based Firm where I worked the summer after my first year of Law School
BKOB-523||she was tall beautiful funny outgoing generous and wickedly smart
BKOB-524||and I was smitten almost from the second I saw her she been assigned by The Firm to look out for me make sure I knew where they office photocopier was and that I generally felt Walker
BKOB-525||that also meant we got to go out for lunches together which allows us to sit and talk the first better jobs and eventually about everything else
BKOB-526||over the course of the next couple years during school breaks and when Michelle came to Harvard as part of the Sibley recruiting team the two of
BKOB-527||after dinner and took long walks along the Charles River talking about movies and family places in the world we want to see
BKOB-528||mother father unexpectedly died of complications arising from multiple sclerosis who have to be with her
BKOB-529||and she comforted me when I learned the Gramps had Advanced prostate cancer
BKOB-530||in other words we became friends as well as lovers and as my law school graduation approached with gingerly circled around the prospect of a life together
BKOB-531||once I took her to an organizing Workshop I was conducting a favor for a friend who ran a community center on the Southside
BKOB-532||participants were mostly single moms some on welfare few with any marketable skills
BKOB-533||I asked them to describe their world as it was and as they would like it to be
BKOB-534||is a simple exercise I've done many times wait for people to bridge the reality of their communities and their lives with the things they could conceivably change
BKOB-535||afterward as we are walking to the car show leyster on through mine and said she'd been touched by my easy rapport with women
BKOB-536||gave them hope I need more than hope I said
BKOB-537||I tried to explain to where the conflict that I was feeling
BKOB-538||between working for change within the system and pushing against
BKOB-539||wanting to lead with wanting to empower people to make change for themselves wanting to be in politics but not other
BKOB-540||Michelle looked at me the world as it is and the world as it should be she said soft
BKOB-541||something like that Michelle was an original I knew nobody quite like her
BKOB-542||and although it hasn't happened yet I was starting to think I might ask her to marry me
BKOB-543||Michelle marriage was given the organic next step in a relationship as serious as ours
BKOB-544||for me someone who grown up with Mother whose marriages didn't last
BKOB-545||I need to formalize our relationship it always felt less pressing
BKOB-546||not only that but in those early years of our courtship are
BKOB-547||could be fierce scotcheroos I could be she never gave Brown
BKOB-548||brother tracking a basketball start Princeton who would worked in Investment Banking before getting into coaching used to joke that the family didn't think Michelle would ever get married because she was too tough
BKOB-549||no guy could keep up with the weird thing was I like that about
BKOB-550||happy constantly challenged me and kept me honest and what was Michelle thinking
BKOB-551||I'm adding her just before we met very much the young professional
BKOB-552||tailored and crisp focused on her career and doing things the way they were supposed to be done but no time for nonsense
BKOB-553||and then this strange guy from Hawaii with a scruffy wardrobe and crazy dreams wanders into her life
BKOB-554||I was part of my appeal should tell me how different I was from the guy she grown up with the men she dated
BKOB-555||different even from her own father whom she adored
BKOB-556||a man who would never finish Community College would been struck by Ms miserly 30s
BKOB-557||but who had never complained and it gone to work every single day and made all of Michelle's dance recital from Craig's basketball game and was always present for his family truly his pride and joy
BKOB-558||life with me promise Michelle something else those things that she saw she had missed as a child
BKOB-560||a Breaking of constraints just as her roots in Chicago a big extended family her common sense
BKOB-561||her desire to be a good mom Above All Else
BKOB-562||Thomaston anchor but I've been missing for much of Maya
BKOB-563||we can just love each other and make each other laugh and share the same basic values it was a symmetry there the way we complemented each other
BKOB-564||we can have each other's backs guard each other's blind spots
BKOB-565||we could be a team of course that was another way of saying we were very different in experience and intemperance
BKOB-566||from Michelle the road to the good life was Marilyn full of Hazards
BKOB-567||family was all you could count on big risks weren't taken lightly
BKOB-568||an outward success a good job nice house
BKOB-569||never made you feel ambivalent because failure and want or all around
BKOB-570||AAA offer shooting away Shopper worried about selling out because growing up on the Southside met you were always at some level I'm outside
BKOB-571||and her mind the roadblocks to making it for plenty clear
BKOB-572||you don't have to go looking for the doubts arose from having to prove no matter how well you did that you belong in the room
BKOB-573||prove not just to those who doubted you but yourself
BKOB-574||is Wasco was coming to an end I told Michelle of my plan
BKOB-575||I wouldn't clerk instead I move back to Chicago try to keep my hand in community work while also practicing a lot of small firm.
BKOB-576||if a good opportunity presented itself I said I could even see myself running for office
BKOB-577||none of this came as a surprise to her she trusted me she said do what I believed was right
BKOB-578||but I need to tell you Barack she said I think what you want to do is really hard
BKOB-579||I mean I wish I had your optimism sometimes I do but people could be so selfish and just plain ignorant
BKOB-580||I think a lot of people don't want to be bothered and I think politics seems like it's full of people willing to do anything for power think about themselves
BKOB-581||especially Chicago I'm not sure you'll ever change that
BKOB-582||I can try can I I said with a smile what's the point of having a fancy law degree if you can't take some risks
BKOB-583||if it doesn't work it doesn't work I'll be okay
BKOB-584||will be okay she said my face in her hands
BKOB-585||have you ever noticed that if there's a hard way and an easy way
BKOB-586||you choose the hard way every time why do you think that is
BKOB-587||we both laughed but I can tell Michelle thought she was onto something
BKOB-588||resume inside that would carry implications for both of us
BKOB-589||after several years of dating Michelle and I were married at Trinity United Church of Christ on October 3rd 1992 with more than 300 of our friends colleagues and family members crammed happily into the pews
BKOB-590||the service was officiated by the church's Pastor Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr
BKOB-591||what coming on at Meijer during my organizing days
BKOB-592||we were joyful a future together was officially begin
BKOB-593||I passed the bar and then delayed my wall prices for a year to run project vote in advance of the 1992 presidential race one of the largest voter registration drives in Illinois history
BKOB-594||after returning from our honeymoon on the California coast
BKOB-595||I taught at the University of Chicago Law School finish my book
BKOB-596||officially joined Davis Miner Barnhill and gal as possible rights for MBA specialized in employment discrimination cases and did real estate work for affordable housing group
BKOB-597||Michelle meanwhile have decided that she'd had enough of corporate law and made a move to the city of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development working there for a year-and-a-half before agreeing to direct a non-profit youth leadership program called public allies
BKOB-598||both of us enjoyed our jobs and the people we work with
BKOB-599||as time went on we got involved with various Civic and philanthropic efforts
BKOB-600||ball games and concerts and shared dinners with a widening Circle of Friends
BKOB-601||we're able to buy a modest but cozy condo in Hyde Park right across from Lake Michigan and Promontory Point just a few doors down from where Craig and his young family live
BKOB-602||Michelle's Mother Miriam still lived in the family South Shore House less than 15 minutes away and we visited often feasting on her fried chicken and greens and red velvet cake and barbecue made
BKOB-603||Michelle don't compete once we were stuffed with sit around the kitchen and listen to her uncle's tell stories by grown-up laughter louder as the evening wore on
BKOB-604||cousins and nephews and nieces bounced on the sofa cushions until they were sent out into the yard
BKOB-605||driving home in the Twilight Michelle and I sometimes talked about having kids tomorrow
BKOB-606||they might be like or how many and what about a dog
BKOB-607||and imagined all the things we do together as a family
BKOB-608||I normally productive happy life
BKOB-609||should have been enough but then in the summer of 1995 a political opportunity arose suddenly strange chain of events
BKOB-610||congressman from the 2nd District of Illinois Mel Reynolds had been indicted on several charges including allegedly having sex with a sixteen-year-old campaign volunteer
BKOB-611||if he was convicted a special election would be probably held to replace
BKOB-612||I didn't live in the district and I lack the name recognition in the base of support to launch a congressional race
BKOB-613||state center for Maria Alice Palmer however was eligible to run for the seat and not long before the congressman was convicted in August she threw her hat into the ring
BKOB-614||Palmer an African-American former educator with deep roots in the community had a solid unremarkable record and was well-liked by progressives and some of the old-time black activist who would help Harold get elected and although I didn't know her we have mutual friends
BKOB-615||based on the work I've done for project boat I was asked to help her Nason campaign
BKOB-616||another week went by several people encourage me to think about filing to run for Alice's soon-to-be vacant senate seat
BKOB-617||for talking to Michelle that made a list of pros and cons
BKOB-618||state senator wasn't glamorous post most people have no idea who their state legislators were
BKOB-619||in Springfield the state capital was Notorious
BKOB-620||for old style Pork barreling logrolling Paola and other political mister
BKOB-621||on the other hand I had to start somewhere and pay my dues
BKOB-622||also they almost State Legislature was in session only a few weeks out of the year
BKOB-623||which meant I could continue teaching and working at the law firm
BKOB-624||best of all Alice Palmer agreed to endorse
BKOB-625||but Reynolds trial still pending it was difficult to know how the timing at work
BKOB-626||technically would be possible for Alice to run for Congress while keeping the option of retaining her States eat if she lost a bigger race but she insisted to me and others that she was done with the Senate ready to move on
BKOB-627||along with an offer of support from our local Alderman Toni preckwinkle boasted the best organization in the area my chances look better than good
BKOB-628||what's Michelle and made my pitch think of it as a test run I said
BKOB-631||take me on the cheek I think this is something you want to do so you should do it
BKOB-632||just promise me I won't have to spend time in Springfield
BKOB-633||add one last person to check in with before I pulled the trigger
BKOB-634||earlier in the year my mother had fallen sick and had been diagnosed with uterine cancer
BKOB-635||the prognosis wasn't good at least once a day the thought of losing her made my heart construct
BKOB-636||at 1 that wire right after she got the news and I have been relieved to find that she look like herself and was in good spirits
BKOB-637||she confessed she was scared but wanted to be as aggressive as possible with a treat
BKOB-638||I'm not going anywhere she said until you give me some grandchildren
BKOB-639||she received the news of my possible State Senate run with her usual enthusiasm insisting I tell her every detail
BKOB-640||acknowledged it would be a lot of work but my mother was never one to see hard work is anything but good
BKOB-641||make sure Michelle's alright with it she said
BKOB-642||on the marriage experts and don't you dare use me as an excuse not to do
BKOB-643||I've got nothing deal with without feeling like everybody putting their lives on hold
BKOB-644||it's morbid understand.
BKOB-645||7 months after diagnosis the situation would turn green
BKOB-646||September Michelle and Islip New York join my and my mother for consultation with a specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
BKOB-647||Midway through chemo now she was physically transformed
BKOB-648||her long dark hair was gone for eyes look Hollow
BKOB-649||worse The Specialist assessment was that her cancer was it stage 4
BKOB-650||and the treatment options were limited watching my mother suck on Ice Cube's because her saliva glands shut down
BKOB-651||did my best to put on a brave face I told her funny stories by my work and work out of the plot of a movie I just seen
BKOB-652||we laughed as Maya nine years younger than me and then studying at New York University reminded me what a bossy big brother I've been
BKOB-653||my help my mother's hand making sure she was comfortable before she settled into rest
BKOB-654||I went back to the hotel room and cried cuz I'm at trip to New York that I suggested my mother come stay with us in Chicago
BKOB-655||my grandmother was too old to care for full-time but my mother forever the architect of her own destiny The Climb
BKOB-656||I'd rather be someplace familiar and warm she said looking out the window
BKOB-657||I sat there feeling helpless thinking about the long path she had traveled in her life how unexpected each step along the way must have been so full of happy accidents
BKOB-658||I never once heard dwell on the disappointments
BKOB-659||instead she seemed to find small Pleasures everywhere
BKOB-660||until this life is strange isn't it she said Softly
BKOB-661||it was following my mother's advice I threw myself into my maiden political campaign
BKOB-662||make me laugh to think back on what a bare-bones operation
BKOB-663||how much more sophisticated in a campaign for student council
BKOB-664||there were no posters though researchers no TV or radio by
BKOB-665||financement on September 19th 1995 was at the Ramada Inn in Hyde Park with pretzels and chips and a couple hundred supporters probably a quarter for more related to Michelle
BKOB-666||our campaign literature consisted of an 8 by 4 inch card with what looked like a passport picture of me a few lines biography and 45 bullet points but I tapped out on my computer
BKOB-667||I've had it printed at Kinkos I did make a point of hiring to political veterans I've met working on Project
BKOB-668||Carolyn Harwell my campaign manager was tall and Sassy
BKOB-669||in early forties and on-loan from Westside Board office
BKOB-670||she came off as irrepressibly cheerful she knew her way around Chicago's bare-knuckle politics
BKOB-671||Ron Davis Big grizzly bear of a man was Garfield rechteren
BKOB-672||fishing expert he had a great flect afro scraggly facial hair and thick wire rim glasses his book hidden by the untuk Blackshear do you seem to wear every single day
BKOB-673||Ron proved to be indispensable Illinois at strike ballot access rules designed to make life hard on Challengers who didn't have party support
BKOB-674||to get on the ballot a candidate needed more than 700 registered voters who lived in the district to sign a petition that was circulated and attested to by someone who also lived in the district
BKOB-675||a good signature had to be legible accurately linked to a local address and from a registered voter
BKOB-676||I still remember the first time a group of us gathered around our dining room table Ron huffing and puffing as he passed out clipboards with the petitions attack along with bota files and a sheet of instructions
BKOB-677||I suggested that before we talked about petitions we should organize them meet the candidate forms maybe draft some position papers
BKOB-678||turn on Ron looked at each other and laugh
BKOB-679||let me tell you something Carol said you can save all that League of Women Voters shit for after the election
BKOB-680||right now the only thing that matters is the petition
BKOB-682||4 times as many on correcting handyman clipboard
BKOB-683||do we chasing I drove out to one of the neighborhoods Ronald selected to gather signatures
BKOB-684||it felt like my early organizing be going from house to house some people not home or unwilling to open the door women in curlers with kids scampering about men doing yard work
BKOB-685||occasionally young men t-shirts and durags breakfast with alcohol as they scan the block
BKOB-686||there were those who want to talk to me about problems with Locust
BKOB-687||or gun violence that was creeping into what had been a stable working-class neighborhood
BKOB-688||mostly folks would take the clipboard sign it and try as quickly as possible to get back to what they've been doing
BKOB-689||it's knocking on doors with pretty standard fare for me the experience was new to Michelle who gamely dedicated part of every weekend to help me out
BKOB-690||and wash it off and collect more signatures benighted under megawatt smile and stories of growing up just a few blocks away there were no Smiles 2 hours later when we get back in the car to drive home
BKOB-691||oh I know she said one point is that I must really love you to spend my Saturday mornings doing this
BKOB-692||over the course of several months we managed to collect four times the number of required signatures
BKOB-693||when I wasn't at the firm or teaching I visit bought Clips Church socials and senior citizen homes making my case to voters
BKOB-694||I wasn't great my stump speech was Steph and Beyond policy speak short on his break
BKOB-695||I also found it awkward to talk about myself
BKOB-696||as an organizer I've been trained always stay in the background
BKOB-697||I just got better though more relaxed and slowly the ranks of my supporters group
BKOB-698||I rounded up endorsements from local officials pastors and a handful of progressive organization
BKOB-699||I even got a few position papers drafted and I'd like to say that this is how my first campaign at the Plucky young candidates and is accomplished beautiful in forbearing wife starting with a few friends in their dining room rallying the people around a new brand of politics
BKOB-700||that's not out happened in August 1995 are disgraced Congressman was finally convicted and sentenced to prison
BKOB-701||special election was called for late November
BKOB-702||with his CMP and the timeline officially said others beside Alice Palmer jumped into the Congressional race among them Jesse Jackson jr. it would drawn national attention for the stirring inside
BKOB-703||his father at the 1988 Democratic National Convention
BKOB-704||Michelle and I knew and liked to Jesse Jr his sister Senti that's been one of Michelle's best friends in high school and maid of honor at our wedding
BKOB-705||he was popular enough that his announcement immediately changed the Dynamics of the race putting Alice at an enormous disadvantage
BKOB-706||and because the special congressional election was now going to take place a few weeks before petitions for Alice's fantasy had to be filed
BKOB-707||I'm starting to worry you better check again to make sure I wasn't going to mess with you she loses Jesse Jr Ronstadt
BKOB-708||I shook my head she promised me she wasn't
BKOB-709||gave me her work and she said it publicly
BKOB-710||in the papers eat that's fine Baroque but can you just check again please
BKOB-711||I did owning Allison once again getting her shirts that regardless what happened with her Congressional run she still intended to leave State politics
BKOB-712||who won the special election but Alice coming in a distant third
BKOB-713||something shifted story starts surfacing in the local press about eight draft Alice Palmer camping
BKOB-714||a few of her longtime supporters asked for meeting and when I showed up they advised me to get out of the race
BKOB-715||Community Conforti give up our seniority they said I should be patient my turn would come
BKOB-716||I stood my ground I had volunteers and donors to it already invested a lot in the campaign after all
BKOB-717||I'd stuck with Alice even when Jesse Jr got it
BKOB-718||but the room was unmoved by the time I spoke to Alice it was clear where events were headed
BKOB-719||the following week she held a press conference in Springfield announcing that she was filing for own last-minute petitions to get on the ballot and retain her seat
BKOB-720||Cheryl said taking a drag from a cigarette and blowing up in Plumas spoke to the feeling
BKOB-721||I thought dishearten than betrayed but I figured all was not well
BKOB-722||we built up a good organization over the previous few months
BKOB-723||and almost all the elected officials who'd endorsements that they stick with us
BKOB-724||Ron and Carol will st182 tell your boss Carol said
BKOB-725||most folks still have no idea who you are shit they don't know who she is either but no offense now
BKOB-726||Allis Chalmers a lot better Ballentine than Barack Obama
BKOB-727||Starpoint but I told them we were going to see things through even his number prominent Scoggins were suddenly urging me to drop out of the race
BKOB-728||and then one afternoon Ron and Carol ride to my house breakfast and looking like they'd won the lottery
BKOB-729||Alice's patricians Ronstadt their terrible worst I've ever seen
BKOB-730||all those Negroes were trying to bully you out of the race they didn't bother actually doing the work
BKOB-731||Mister get her knocked off the ballot I looked through the informal Talley's Ron and our campaign volunteers it done
BKOB-732||it was true Christians Allison Schmitt
BKOB-733||go to be filled with invalid signatures people whose addresses were outside the district multiple signatures with different names but the same handwriting
BKOB-734||I scratch my head I don't know guys you don't know what turtle set
BKOB-735||I don't know if I want to win like this I mean I'm pissed about what happened but these ballad rules don't make much sense either just beat her
BKOB-736||purplebeck vagina tightening this woman gave you her word she said
BKOB-737||we all been busting our asses out here based on that promise
BKOB-738||and now when she tries to screw you and can't even do that right
BKOB-739||you're going to let her get away with it you don't think they would knock you off the belt in a second if they could
BKOB-740||she shook her head nod your good guy that's why we believe in you but if you let this go you might as well go back to being a professor and whatnot cuz politics is not for you
BKOB-741||you will get chewed up and you won't be doing anybody a damn bit of good
BKOB-742||I went to run and said quietly she's right
BKOB-743||I mean back to my chair unless cigarette I felt suspended in time trying to decipher what I was feeling in my gut
BKOB-744||how much did I want this reminded Myself by what I believed I could get done in office how hard I was willing to work if I got the chance
BKOB-745||okay I said finally okay Carol said her smile return
BKOB-746||Ron gathered up his papers and put them in his back it would take a couple of months for the process play out
BKOB-747||with my decision that day the race was effectively over we filed our challenge for the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners and when it became clear the board was going to rule in our favor Alice drop that
BKOB-748||while we're at it we not several other Democrats with bad petitions off a dog as well
BKOB-749||without a democratic opponent with only token Republican opposition I was on my way to the states
BKOB-750||whatever Vision I dad for a more noble kind of
BKOB-751||it would have to wait I suppose there are useful lessons to draw from that first campaign
BKOB-752||I learned to respect the nuts-and-bolts of Politics the attention to detail required
BKOB-753||Daily Grind that might prove the difference between winning and losing
BKOB-754||confirm to what I already knew about myself
BKOB-755||whatever preferences I had for Fairplay I didn't like to lose
BKOB-756||the blessing that stayed with me most had nothing to do with campaign mechanics or Hardball politics
BKOB-757||it had to do with the phone call I received from my own Hawaii one day in early November while before I knew how my race would turn out
BKOB-758||she's taking a bad turn bear why I said
BKOB-760||already knew that my mother's condition have been deteriorating at spoken to her just a few days before
BKOB-761||during a new level of pain and resignation in her voice I booked a flight to Hawaii for the following week
BKOB-762||can she talk is my amount
BKOB-763||he's fading in and out I hung up the phone call the airline to reschedule my flight for first thing in the morning
BKOB-764||I called Carol the castle some campaign events run through what needed to be done in my absence
BKOB-765||a few hours later my called back I'm sorry honey

BKOB-769||I remember playing there was a child my mother sitting in the sun and watching me as I tumbled in the grass hopped over the Rocks steps can cut tadpoles in the Stream that ran down one side
BKOB-770||afterward my and I drove out to look at near Koko Head and Scattered rashes into the sea
BKOB-771||the waves crashing against the rocks and I thought about my mother and sister alone in that hospital room
BKOB-772||I mean not there so busy with my grandpa suits
BKOB-773||I knew I could never get that moment back on top of my sorrow
BKOB-774||I thought the great shame unless you live at the southern tip of Chicago the quickest route to Springfield is via I-55
BKOB-775||during rush hour heading out of downtown and through the western suburbs traffic slows to a crawl

BKOB-838||I started writing a regular column for the Hyde Park Herald a neighborhood weekly with a readership of less than 5,000
BKOB-839||I hosted Town Hall setting up refreshments and stacks of legislative updates and usually sat there with my lonesome staffer looking at my watch waiting for a crowd that never came
BKOB-840||I can blame folks for not showing up they were busy they had families and surely most of the Basin Springfield seemed remote
BKOB-841||meanwhile on the few high-profile issues that my constituents did care about 8 probably agreed with me already since
BKOB-842||why is my district like those of almost every District in Illinois have been drawn with surgical Precision to ensure one-party dominance
BKOB-843||if I wanted more funding for schools in poor neighborhoods if I wanted more access to Primary Health Care or retraining for laid-off workers I didn't need to convince my constituents
BKOB-844||the people I need the engage and persuade they live somewhere else
BKOB-845||by the end of my second session I could feel the atmosphere of the capital Weighing on me
BKOB-846||the futility of being in the minority the cynicism of so many of my colleagues worn like a badge of honor
BKOB-847||no doubt it showed one day while I was standing in the Rotunda after Bill I'd introduced went down in flames alone meeting lobbyist came up and put his arm around
BKOB-848||you've got to stop beating your head against the wall Brock he said
BKOB-849||the key to surviving this place is understanding that it's a business by selling cars
BKOB-850||or the dry cleaner down the street you start believing it's more than that it'll drive you crazy
BKOB-851||some political scientists argue that everything I've said about Springfield describes exactly how pluralism is supposed to work
BKOB-852||but the horse-trading between interest groups may not be inspiring but it keeps democracy muddling along
BKOB-853||maybe that argument would have gone down easier with me at the time if it weren't for the life I was missing at home
BKOB-854||the first two years in the legislature we're fine Michelle was busy with her own work and although she kept her promise not to come down to the state capitol except for my swearing-in we still have leisurely conversations on the phone on nights I was away
BKOB-855||then one day in the fall of 1997 she called me at the office for boys trembling
BKOB-857||you're going to be a daddy I was going to be a daddy
BKOB-858||Apple of Joy the month of followed were
BKOB-859||I lived up to every cliche of the expectant father attending Lamaze classes trying to figure out how to assemble a crib reading the book What to Expect When You're Expecting With Pen in Hand to underline key passages
BKOB-860||around 6 a.m. on the 4th of July Michelle poke me and said it was time to go to the hospital
BKOB-861||I fumbled around and gather the bag outfit by the door
BKOB-862||the seven hours later was introduced to Malia Ann Obama 8 lb and 15 ounces of perfection
BKOB-863||among her many talents are new daughter had good time
BKOB-864||but no session no classes and no big pending cases to work on I can take the rest of the summer off
BKOB-865||a night owl by Nature I'm in the late shift so Michelle could sleep
BKOB-866||resting Milian MI5 to read to her as she looked up a big questioning eyes are dozing as she lay on my chest a burping a good poop behind us so warm and Serene
BKOB-867||I thought about the generations of men who would miss such moments
BKOB-868||I thought about my own father was absent so done more to shape me than the brief time I spent with him and I realized there was no place on Earth I would rather be
BKOB-869||but the trains again Parenthood eventually took their toll
BKOB-870||after Blissful few months the show went back to work and I went back to juggling 3 jobs
BKOB-871||we were lucky to find a wonderful man who cared for Malia during the day but the addition of a full-time employee to our family Enterprise squeeze the budget card
BKOB-872||Michelle bore the brunt of all this shuffling between mothering and work unconvinced that she was doing either job well
BKOB-874||we began arguing more really late at night when the two of us were thoroughly drain
BKOB-875||this isn't what I signed up for Barack Michelle said at one point I feel like I'm doing all by myself
BKOB-876||I was hurt by that if I wasn't working I was home
BKOB-877||if I was home and I forgot to clean up the kitchen after dinner it was because I had to stay up late writing exam or fine-tuning a brief
BKOB-878||but even if I mounted my defense I knew I was falling short
BKOB-879||inside Michelle anger lay more difficult truth
BKOB-880||was trying to deliver a lot of things to a lot of different people
BKOB-881||I'll take the hard way just like she predicted back when her burdens were lighter or personal responsibilities not so andmesh
BKOB-882||I thought now about the promise I made to myself after Maliya was born
BKOB-883||my kids would know me the big rub knowing my love for them feeling that I had always put them first
BKOB-884||sitting in the dim light of our living room Michelle no longer seemed angry just sad
BKOB-885||was worth it I don't recall what I said in response
BKOB-886||I know I couldn't admit to her but I was no longer score
BKOB-887||it's hard in retrospect I understand why you did something stupid
BKOB-888||I don't even small stuff ruining your favorite Thai because you tried to eat soup in the car or throwing out your back because you got talked into playing tackle football on Thanksgiving
BKOB-889||I mean dumb choices in the wake of considerable deliberation
BKOB-890||those times when you identify a real problem in your life
BKOB-891||analyze it and then with utter confidence come up with precisely the wrong answer
BKOB-892||that was me running for congress after numerous conversations I had to concede the Michelle was right to question whether the difference I was making in Springfield justify the sacrifice
BKOB-893||rather than lightening my load though I went in the opposite direction deciding I needed to step on the gas and secure
BKOB-894||a more influential office around the same time veteran Congressman Bobby Rush the former black panther challenge Mayor Daley in the 1999 election then got trapped doing poorly even in his own
BKOB-895||I thought Russia's campaign had been uninspired without a rash now other than the Vape promised to continue Harold Washington's Legacy

BKOB-897||after talking it over with a few trusted advisors I had my staff jerry-rig an in-house Pole to see whether race against Russia would be viable
BKOB-898||are informal sampling gave us a shot using the results I was able to persuade several of my closest friends to help Finance the race
BKOB-899||and then despite warnings for more experienced political hands that Rush was stronger than he looked and despite Michelle's incredulity that I would somehow think she'd feel better with me being in Washington instead of Springfield
BKOB-900||I announce my candidacy for congressman from the first
BKOB-901||special district almost from the start the race was a disaster
BKOB-902||a few weeks in the Rumblings from the rest camp begin
BKOB-903||Papa's not spider she's back by white folks
BKOB-904||he's a Harvard elitist and that name is here
BKOB-905||having raised enough money to commission a proper pole I discovered the body had 90 percent name recognition in the district and a 70 percent approval rating was only 11 percent of Voters even knew who I was
BKOB-906||shortly thereafter Bobby's adult son was tragically shot and killed a listing on outpouring of sympathy
BKOB-907||I effectively suspended my campaign for a month and watch television coverage of the funeral taking place of my own church with Reverend Jeremiah Wright preside
BKOB-908||already on thin ice at home I took the family to Hawaii for an abbreviated Christmas break only to have the governor call a special legislative session to vote on a gun-control measure I support it
BKOB-909||with eighteen-month-old Malia s unable to fly I missed the boat and was roundly flayed by the Chicago press
BKOB-910||I lost by 30 points about politics I sometimes offer this story is an object lesson of what not to do
BKOB-911||usually at throwing a PostScript describing how a few months after my loss A friend of mine worried that I'd fallen into a funk insisted that I join him at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in LA
BKOB-912||you didn't get back on the horsey set but when I landed at LAX and try to rent a car I was turned down because my American Express card was over its limit
BKOB-913||I managed to get myself to the Staples Center but then learned that the credential my friend at secured for me didn't allow entry to the convention floor which left me to haplessly circle the perimeter and watch the festivities on mounted TV screen
BKOB-914||finally after an awkward episode later that evening and wish my friend couldn't get me into
BKOB-915||party he was attending I took a cab back to the hotel slept on the couch and his sweet and flew back to Chicago just as algor was accepting the nomination
BKOB-916||it's a funny story especially in light of where I optimally ended up
BKOB-917||it speaks I tell my audience to the unpredictable nature of politics and the necessity for resilience
BKOB-918||what I don't mention is my dark mood on that flight back
BKOB-919||I was almost fourtybroke coming off a humiliating defeat and with my marriage strain
BKOB-920||I felt for perhaps the first time in my life that I've taken a wrong turn
BKOB-921||whatever reservoirs of energy and optimism I thought I had whatever potential I'd always banked on have been used up on a Fool's errand
BKOB-922||worse I recognize been running for congress I've been driven not by some selfless dream of changing the world
BKOB-923||rather by the need to justify the choices I'd already made
BKOB-924||or to satisfy my ego
BKOB-925||well my Envy of those with achieved what I had not
BKOB-926||in other words I become the very thing that has a younger man I've warned myself against
BKOB-927||I'd become a politician and not a very good one at that
BKOB-928||chapter 3 after getting dropped by Bobby Rush I allowed myself a few months to mow and lick my wounds before deciding that I had to reframe my priorities and get on with things
BKOB-929||I told Michelle I needed to do better by her
BKOB-930||we have new baby on the way and even though I was still gone more than she would have preferred she at least noticed the effort I was making
BKOB-931||schedule my meetings in Springfield so that I'd be home for dinner more often
BKOB-932||I tried to be more punctual and more present
BKOB-933||and on June 10th 2001 not quite three years after Malia's birth
BKOB-934||we experience the same Blaster Joy the same
BKOB-935||when Sasha ride plump and lovely as her sister had been
BKOB-936||thick black curls that were impossible to resist
BKOB-937||for the next two years I let a quieter life
BKOB-938||small satisfactions content with the balance side seemingly struck
BKOB-939||I relished wriggling Malia into her first ballet tights are grasping her hand as we walk to the park
BKOB-940||watching baby Sasha laugh and laugh as I nibbled her feet
BKOB-941||listen to Michelle's breastflow forehead resting gift my shoulder is she drifted out to sleep in the middle of an old movie
BKOB-942||I rededicated myself to my work in the state senate and Savor the time spent with my students at the law school
BKOB-943||epic serious look at our finances and put together a plan to pay down our debts
BKOB-944||inside the floor rhythms of my work and the pleasures of fatherhood I began to consider options for Life After politics
BKOB-945||craps teaching and writing full-time for returning tilapia
BKOB-946||or applying for job at a local charitable Foundation as my mother had once imagined I do
BKOB-947||in other words following my ill-fated run for Congress
BKOB-948||experienced a certain letting go if not of my desire to make a difference in the world then at least of the insistence that had to be done on a larger stage
BKOB-949||but might have begun is a sense of resignation and whatever limits fate had imposed on my life came to feel more like gratitude for the Bounty it Authority delivered
BKOB-950||two things however kept me from making a clean break from politics
BKOB-952||when does our Democrats could reverse the Republican gerrymandering of the previous decade and vastly better the odds that Senate Democrats would be in the majority after the 2002 election
BKOB-953||I knew that with one more term I'd finally get a chance to pass some Bill
BKOB-954||deliver something meaningful for the people I represent it and perhaps and my political career on a higher note when I was currently on
BKOB-955||s factor was an instinct rather than an event
BKOB-956||being elected I tried to spend a few days each summer visiting various colleagues in their home districts across Illinois
BKOB-957||usually I go with my cheese Saturday Dan Shulman the former upei reporter with big glasses Boundless Energy and a Foghorn voice
BKOB-958||which are golf clubs a map than a couple of sets of clothes in the back of my Jeep and head south or West Winding our way that Rock Island or pickneyville Alton or Carbondale
BKOB-959||Dan was Mikey political advisor a good friend and an ideal road trip companion
BKOB-960||easy to talk to perfectly fine with silence and he shared my habit of smoking in the car
BKOB-961||he also had an encyclopedic knowledge of State politics
BKOB-962||first time we made the trip I could tell he was a little nervous about how folks downstate might react to a black lawyer from Chicago with an Arab sounding name
BKOB-963||no fancy shirts instructor before we left
BKOB-964||I don't have fancy shirts I said good just polos and khakis
BKOB-965||got it despite dance worries but I'd be out of place
BKOB-966||what struck me most during our travels without familiar everything felt whether we were at a county fair or Union Hall front porch on someone's Farm
BKOB-967||in the way people describe their families for their jobs
BKOB-968||and their modesty and their hospitality and their enthusiasm for high school basketball
BKOB-969||and the food they serve fried chicken and baked beans and Jell-O molds
BKOB-970||and then my heard echoes to my grandparents
BKOB-971||my mother Michelle's mom and dad
BKOB-972||same value same hopes and dreams
BKOB-973||excursions became more sporadic once my kids were born
BKOB-974||simple recurring inside they offered stayed with me
BKOB-975||as long as the residence of my Chicago district and districts downstate remain strangers to one another I realized
BKOB-976||a politics would never truly change it would always be too easy for politicians to feed the stereotypes that pitted black against white immigrant against native-born rural interests against those of City
BKOB-977||if on the other hand a campaign challenge America's raining political assumptions about how Divided We Were
BKOB-978||well then just maybe it would be possible to build a new covenant between its citizens
BKOB-979||in Fighters would no longer be able to play one group against another
BKOB-980||legislators might be freed from defining their constituents interests and their own so narrowly
BKOB-981||the media might take notice and examine issues based not on which side won or lost but on whether our common goals were met
BKOB-982||ultimately wasn't this what I was after politics Abridged America's racial ethnic and religious divides as well as the many strands of my own life
BKOB-983||maybe I was being unrealistic maybe such divisions were too deeply entrenched
BKOB-984||no matter how hard I tried to convince myself otherwise I couldn't shake the feeling that it was too early to give up on my deepest convictions
BKOB-985||much as I tried to tell myself I was done or nearly done with political life
BKOB-986||I know in my heart that I wasn't ready to let go
BKOB-987||they gave the future more thought one thing became Queen
BKOB-988||kind of bridge building politics I imagined wasn't suited to a congressional race
BKOB-989||promise structural matter how district lines were drawn
BKOB-990||in an overwhelmingly black District like the one I lived in in a community that has long been battered by discrimination and neglect
BKOB-991||the test for politicians would more often than not be defined in racial terms just as it was in many white World districts that felt left behind
BKOB-992||how well will you stand up to those who are not like us motor that those with taking advantage of us
BKOB-993||look down on us you can make a difference from such a narrow political base with some seniority
BKOB-994||you could secure better services for constituents bring a big project or two back to your home district and by working with Allies try to influence the national debate
BKOB-995||that would be enough to lift the political constraints the Minnesota code to deliver Health Care to those who most needed it or better schools for poor kids or jobs where there were none
BKOB-996||the same constraints the Bobby Rush labored under everyday
BKOB-997||the really shake things up I realized I needed to speak to an
BKOB-998||for the widest possible audience and the best way to do that
BKOB-999||what's a run for Statewide office white for example the US Senate
BKOB-1000||I think back now on the brashness this year of me wanting to launch a US Senate race fresh as I was off a responding to feet
BKOB-1001||it's hard not to admit the possibility that I was just desperate for another shot like an alcoholic rationalizing one last breath
BKOB-1002||said that's not how it's felt instead of I rolled ID around my head
BKOB-1003||experienced a great clarity not so much that I would win but then I could win
BKOB-1004||and if I did when I could have a big impact
BKOB-1006||like a running back spots an opening at the line of scrimmage and knows that if he can get to that whole fast enough and breakthrough don't be nothing but open field between him in the endzone
BKOB-1007||along with Clarity came a parallel realization
BKOB-1008||if I didn't pull it off it would be time to leave politics
BKOB-1009||and so long as I've given it my best effort I could do so without regret
BKOB-1010||quietly over the course of 2002 I began to test the proposition
BKOB-1011||looking at Belmar political landscape I saw that the notion of a little-known black state legislator going to the US Senate wasn't totally farfetched
BKOB-1012||several African Americans who won Statewide office before including former US senator Carol Moseley Braun
BKOB-1013||The Talented but erratic politician whose Victory had Electrify the country before she was dinged up by series of self-inflicted wounds involving Financial ethics
BKOB-1014||meanwhile the Republican who beating her Peter Fitzgerald was a wealthy Banker whose sharply conservative views made him relatively unpopular across our increasingly Democratic state
BKOB-1015||I begin by talking to a trio of my state senate poker buddies Democrats Terry link Denny's
BKOB-1016||Gibson Larry wants to see whether they thought I could compete in the white working-class and roll enclaves they represent
BKOB-1017||from what they've seen during my visit I thought I could and all agreed to support me if I ran
BKOB-1018||go to the number of white Progressive elected officials along Chicago's lakefront and a handful of independent Latino legislators as well
BKOB-1019||I have Jeffy Junior if he had any interest in running and he said no adding that he was prepared to lend me his support
BKOB-1020||Congressman Danny Davis the genial third black Congressman in the old or delegation signed onto
BKOB-1021||I can hardly fault Bobby Rush for being less enthusiastic
BKOB-1022||most important was email jumps now poised to be State Senate President than hence one of the three most powerful politicians in Illinois
BKOB-1023||at a meeting in his office I pointed out that not a single current u.s. Senator was asking American and at the policies that we bought for together in Springfield really could use a champion in Washington
BKOB-1024||I added but if you were to help get one of his own elected to the US Senate it would surely golf of the Old Guard white Republicans in Springfield who he felt had always told him sure
BKOB-1025||which was a rationale I think he particularly liked with David Axelrod I figure different Tech
BKOB-1026||a media consultant who previously been a journalist and whose clients included Harold Washington former US senator Paul Simon and mayor Rich Daley
BKOB-1027||accident belt the national reputation for being smart tough and skilled at me
BKOB-1028||I admired his work and I knew that having him on board would lend my Mason campaign credibility. Just run the state or national donors and pundits
BKOB-1029||I Knew Too that he'd be a tough sell it's a reach he said on the day we met for lunch at a River North Bistro
BKOB-1030||active been one of many who would warn me against taking on Bobby Rush
BKOB-1031||cardi B of A sandwich he told me I couldn't afford a second loss
BKOB-1032||any doubt it a candidate whose name rhymes with Osama could get down state floats
BKOB-1033||plus it already been approached by at least two other likely Senate candidates they come forward and Hines and multi-millionaire hedge fund manager Blair Hall
BKOB-1034||both of them seemed a much stronger position to win so taking me on as a client was likely to cost his firm a hefty sum
BKOB-1035||wait till Rich Bailey retires and then run for mayor he concluded wiping mustard off his mustache it's better
BKOB-1036||he was right of course but I wasn't playing the conventional odds and an axe I sensed beneath all the poll data and strategy memos and talking points that were the tools of his trade
BKOB-1037||I'm going to storm self is more than just a Hired Gun
BKOB-1038||someone who might be a kindred spirit rather than arguing campaign mechanics I tried to appeal to his heart
BKOB-1039||Timber think about how JFK and Bobby Kennedy seem to tap into what's bathroom people I ask
BKOB-1040||I wonder how it felt to help LBJ passed the voting rights after FDR passed Social Security
BKOB-1041||I want you made millions of people's lives better
BKOB-1042||politics doesn't have to be with people think it is
BKOB-1043||can be something more access imposing eyebrows went up as he scanned my face
BKOB-1044||it must have been clear that I wasn't just trying to convince him
BKOB-1045||I was convincing myself a few weeks later he called to say that after talking it over with his business partners and his wife Susan you decide to take me on as a client
BKOB-1046||before I can thank him for Bible
BKOB-1047||your idealism is stirring Brock but unless you can raise 5 million bucks to get it on TV so people can hear it you don't stand a chance
BKOB-1048||with this I finally felt ready to test the waters with Michelle
BKOB-1049||you about working as the executive director for Community Affairs the University of Chicago hospital system
BKOB-1050||a job that gave her more flexibility but still required to juggle high-level
BKOB-1051||professional responsibilities with coordinating the girl play dates in school pickups
BKOB-1052||a little surprised Winstead responding with hell no bro
BKOB-1054||what I didn't know at the time was that Michelle had already gotten to Marty and Valerie and assigned them the job of talking me out of my foolishness
BKOB-1055||we gathered Valerie's High Park apartment and over Longbranch explain my thought process mapping out the scenarios would get us to the Democratic nomination and answering questions about how this race would be different from the last
BKOB-1056||but Michelle I didn't sugarcoat the amount of time I'd be away but this was that I promise
BKOB-1057||I lost this one we were done with politics for good
BKOB-1058||by the time I finished Valerie Marty have been persuaded no doubt to Michelle Chagrin
BKOB-1059||it wasn't a question of strategy for her aside from the fact that the thought of another campaign appeal to her about as much as root canal
BKOB-1060||she was most concerned with the effect on our family finances would still hadn't fully recovered from last
BKOB-1061||reminded me that we have student loans on mortgage and credit card that to think about
BKOB-1062||we haven't started saving for our daughter's college education
BKOB-1063||and on top of that that run would require me to stop practicing Law & Order Doughboy complex Memphis which would further diminish our income
BKOB-1064||if you lose will be deeper in the hole she said and what happens if you win are we supposed to maintain two households in Washington and Chicago when we can barely keep up with one
BKOB-1065||I'd anticipated this if I win on I said it will draw national attention
BKOB-1066||I'll be the only after American in the Senate
BKOB-1067||with a higher profile I could write another book and also lot of copies and that will cover the added expenses
BKOB-1068||shoveled out of sharp laugh I made some money on my first book but nothing close to what it would take to pay for the expenses I was not talking about incurring
BKOB-1069||is my wife song that most people would say that I imagine an Unwritten book was hardly a financial plan
BKOB-1070||in other words she said you got the magic beans in your pocket
BKOB-1071||that's what you telling me you got some magic beans and you're going to plant them in overnight a huge Beanstalk is going to grow High into the sky and you'll climb up the Beanstalk kill the giant who lives in the clouds and then bring home a goose that lays golden eggs
BKOB-1072||is that it sounds like that I said
BKOB-1073||Michelle stripper hadn't looked out the window we both knew what I was asking for
BKOB-1074||another disruption another gamble another step in the direction of something I
BKOB-1075||wanted and she truly didn't this isn't Barack Michelle said one last time
BKOB-1076||don't expect me to do any camping in fact you shouldn't even count on my butt
BKOB-1077||as a kid I sometimes watched as my salesman grandfather tried to sell life insurance policies over the phone
BKOB-1078||space registering misery as he make cold calls in the evening for my 10th floor apartment in a Honolulu highrise
BKOB-1079||during the early months of 2003 I found myself thinking of him often as I sat at my desk in the sparsely furnished headquarters of my newly launched Senate campaign
BKOB-1080||play the posters Muhammad Ali post triumphantly over a defeated Sonny Liston trying to pep talk myself into making another fundraising call
BKOB-1081||Kentucky named Jim kollywood recruited this campaign manager or staff insisted mostly of kids in their twenties only half of them were paid and two of them were still undergraduates
BKOB-1082||I felt especially sorry for my loan full-time fundraiser who had to push me to pick up the phone and solicit donations
BKOB-1083||will I getting better at being a politician I couldn't say
BKOB-1084||in the first scheduled candidates Forum in February 2003 I was Stephen ineffective
BKOB-1085||unable to get my brain to operate in the Tidy phrases such format required
BKOB-1086||but my lost the Bobby Rush had given me a clear blueprint for upping my game
BKOB-1087||I need it to interact more effectively with media learning to get my ideas across in pithy sound like
BKOB-1088||I needed to build a campaign there was less about policy papers more about connecting one-on-one with boaters
BKOB-1089||and I needed to raise money lots of
BKOB-1090||we conducted multiple poles would seem to confirm that I could win
BKOB-1091||only if I managed to improve my visibility was costly TV at
BKOB-1092||and yet as snake bit as my congressional races been this one felt strong
BKOB-1093||in April Peter Fitzgerald decided not to run for re-election
BKOB-1094||Carol Moseley Braun who would probably have locked up the Democratic nomination for old seat and inexplicably chosen to run for president instead leaving the contest wide open
BKOB-1095||the primary race against six other Democrats I want about lining up endorsements from unions and popular members of our Congressional Delegation helping the short mydownstate and liberal basis
BKOB-1096||ATB meal of democratic majority in the state senate has spearheaded the passage of a slew of bills requiring the videotaping of interrogations and capital cases to an expansion the Earned Income Tax Credit reinforcing my credentials as an effective legislator
BKOB-1097||the national political landscape tilted my favor is well
BKOB-1098||in October 2002 before even announcing my candidacy
BKOB-1099||I've been invited to speak against the impending US invasion of Iraq addressing an anti-war rally held in downtown Chicago
BKOB-1100||for soon-to-be Santa candidate the politics for money
BKOB-1101||both asked Dad thought the taking a clear unequivocal stand against the war with helping a Democratic primary
BKOB-1102||others caution that given the post 9/11 mood of the country at the time National poll showed as many as 67 percent of Americans in favor of taking military action against Iraq
BKOB-1103||the likelihood of at least short-term military success and my already challenging name and lineage opposition to the war could cripple my candidacy by election time
BKOB-1104||America likes to Kick Ass 1 friend Warren
BKOB-1105||I'm old over the question for a day or so and decided this was my first test
BKOB-1106||when I run the kind of campaign that I promised myself
BKOB-1107||I typed out a short speech 5 or 6 minutes long
BKOB-1108||and satisfied that reflected my honest bullies went to bed without sending it to the team for review
BKOB-1109||Palmdale rally more than 1,000 people gathered at Federal Plaza but Jeffy
BKOB-1110||the headliner was cold the wind gusting
BKOB-1111||there's a smattering of Applause muffled by mittens and gloves my name was called and I stepped up to the microphone
BKOB-1112||let me Begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti-war rally
BKOB-1113||I stand before you as someone who's not opposed to war in all circumstances
BKOB-1114||crowd grew quiet uncertain where I was going
BKOB-1115||I described the blood spilled preserve the union and Usher in the new birth of Freedom The Pride I had my grandfather volunteering to fight in the wake of Pearl Harbor
BKOB-1116||my support for military action in Afghanistan and my own willingness to take up arms to prevent another
BKOB-1117||I don't oppose all wars I said what I am opposed to is a dumb War
BKOB-1118||I went on to argue that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the United States or its neighbors and that even a successful war against Iraq war require a u.s. occupation of
BKOB-1119||undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
BKOB-1120||I ended with the suggestion that President Bush was looking for a fight he should finish the job against Al-Qaeda stop supporting repressive regimes and wean America off Middle Eastern
BKOB-1122||leaving the pots I assumed my remarks would be little more than a footnote
BKOB-1123||news reports barely mention my presence at the rally
BKOB-1124||only a few months after us LED military Coalition begin bombing Baghdad Democrats started turning against the Iraq War
BKOB-1125||is casualties and Chaos Mountain the Press began asking questions that should have been posed from the outside
BKOB-1126||a Groundswell of Grassroots activism lifted a little-known Vermont Governor Howard Dean the challenge 2004 presidential candidates like John Kerry voted in support of the war
BKOB-1127||the short speech at given at the anti-war rally suddenly look
BKOB-1128||I began to circulate on the internet
BKOB-1129||my young staff had to explain to me what the hell blogs and Myspace had to do with the flood of new volunteers and Grassroots donations we were something again
BKOB-1130||as candidate I was having fun
BKOB-1132||I Hopscotch through the suburbs from the leafy Mansion filled Northshore Two Towns just south and west of the city where poverty and Bennett Buildings made some of them indistinguishable from Chicago's roughest neighborhoods
BKOB-1133||every couple weeks I've had downstait sometimes driving myself but more often traveling
BKOB-1134||Jeremiah postal or Anita Decker the two towns of staffers running my operations there
BKOB-1135||talking to voters in the early days of the campaign I tended to address the issues I was running on
BKOB-1136||ending tax breaks for companies that we're moving jobs overseas or promoting renewable energy or making it easier for kids to afford College
BKOB-1137||explain why it opposed the war in Iraq acknowledging the remarkable service of our soldiers the questioning why with certain new war when we had finished the one in Afghanistan while Osama Bin Laden was still at Large
BKOB-1138||overtime though I focus more on lesson
BKOB-1139||the more I listen the more people opened up
BKOB-1140||tell me about how it felt to be laid off after a lifetime of War
BKOB-1141||what it was like to have your home foreclosed upon or to have to sell the family farm
BKOB-1142||tell me about not being able to afford health insurance and I'll sometimes they broke the pills the doctor prescribed in half hoping to make the medicine last longer
BKOB-1143||I spoke to young people moving away because there were no good jobs in their town
BKOB-1144||brothers having a Dropout of college just shorter graduation because they couldn't cover the twist
BKOB-1145||my stump speech became less assertive the positions and more Chronicle of these different voices
BKOB-1146||course of Americans from every corner of the state
BKOB-1147||here's the thing I would say most people wherever they're from whatever they look like
BKOB-1148||I'm looking for the same thing and not trying to get filthy rich
BKOB-1149||I don't expect someone else to do what they can do for themselves
BKOB-1150||they do expect that if they're willing to work they should be able to find a job that supports a family
BKOB-1151||expected they shouldn't go bankrupt just because they get sick
BKOB-1152||expect the kids to be able to get a good education Wanda prepares them for this new economy
BKOB-1153||and they should be able to afford College if they put in the effort
BKOB-1154||I want be safe from criminals or terrorists
BKOB-1155||they figure that after a lifetime of War
BKOB-1156||spell retire with dignity and respect
BKOB-1158||and although they don't expect government to solve all their problems they do know deep in their phones that would just a slight change in priorities government could help
BKOB-1159||the room would be quiet night take a few questions when a meeting was over people lined up to shake my hand picked up some campaign literature talk to Jeremiah and need in Aurora Local campaign volunteer about how they could get involved
BKOB-1160||and I drive onto the next time knowing that the story I was telling was true
BKOB-1161||convinced that this campaign was no longer about me
BKOB-1162||but I become a conduit through which people might recognize the value of their own stories
BKOB-1163||their own worth and share them with one another
BKOB-1164||what are in sports or politics it's hard to understand the precise nature
BKOB-1165||momentum the by the beginning of 2004 we had
BKOB-1166||ask how to shoot two television ads the first had me speaking directly to the camera ending with the tagline yes we can
BKOB-1167||I thought this was corny but act immediately appealed to a higher power showing it to Michelle who deemed it not cornea.
BKOB-1168||second featured Sheila Simon daughter of the state's beloved former senator Paul Simon who died following heart surgery days before he planned to publicly endorse
BKOB-1169||we released the ass just four weeks before the primaries
BKOB-1170||in short order my support almost double
BKOB-1171||want to say five largest newspapers endorse me extra cut the ads to highlighted explaining why candidates tend to benefit more than white candidates from the validation
BKOB-1172||around this time the bottom fell out of my closest Rivals campaign after news outlets publish details from previously sealed court documents in which his ex-wife
BKOB-1173||domestic abuse March 16th 2004 the day of the Democratic primary
BKOB-1174||we ended up winning almost 53 percent of the vote in our seven-person field
BKOB-1175||that only more than all the other Democratic candidates combined but more than all the Republican votes have been cast Statewide in their primary
BKOB-1176||I remember only two moments from that night the delighted squeal from our daughters would maybe a little fear mixed in for two-year-old Sasha when the confetti guns went off at the victory party
BKOB-1177||and an ebullient act Rod telling me that I've won all but one of the majority-white wards in Chicago which had once served as the epicenter of racial resistance to Harold Washington

BKOB-1187||my campaign didn't have the luxury celebration we just scramble to keep up
BKOB-1188||we brought on additional more experienced staff including

BKOB-1237||you've tapped into some collective spirit
BKOB-1238||I think we all know and wish for sense of connection that overrides our differences and replaces them with the Giants Well of possibility
BKOB-1239||and like all things that matter most you know the moment is fleeting
BKOB-1240||but soon the spell will be broken
BKOB-1241||before that night I thought I understood the power of the media
BKOB-1242||I've seen how axelrod's ads and catapulted me into the lead in the primary
BKOB-1243||strangers with some a honk and wave from their cars or have children brush up to me on the street and say with great seriousness I saw you on TV

BKOB-1248||as satisfying as retention I got in Boston was though I assumed it was circumstantial and I figured they were political junkies people who follow the stuff minute by minute
BKOB-1249||immediately after the convention do Michelle and I are the girls loaded up our stuff instead out for a week-long RV trip in downstate Illinois
BKOB-1250||designer showboaters I remain focused on Illinois and that I hadn't gotten too big for my britches

BKOB-1260||be sure to see Daddy Michelle said why

BKOB-1263||no matter how much we told ourselves that interest would fade in the balloon would deflate
BKOB-1264||no matter how much we tried to guard against complacency
BKOB-1265||the election itself became almost an afterthought

BKOB-1281||Michelle has decided that she and the kids would stay in Chicago but she had a support circle of family and friends not to mention a job she really loved

BKOB-1298||I nodded and kissed her forehead magic beans baby magic beans
BKOB-1299||typically the biggest challenge for freshman senator in Washington is getting people to pay attention to anything you do
BKOB-1300||I end up having the opposite problem don't touch my actual status as an incoming Senator the hype that surrounded me had grown comic
BKOB-1301||reporters routinely press me on my plans most often asking if I intended to run for
BKOB-1302||when I'm the day I was sworn in a reporter asked what do you consider your place in history I laughed explaining that I just arrived in Washington was ranked 99th and Sandy

BKOB-1306||Cadillac any inflated expectations my team and I look to the example set by Hillary Clinton
BKOB-1307||would enter the Senate four years earlier to a lot of fanfare and had gone on to develop a reputation for diligent substance and attention to her constituents
BKOB-1308||give me a Workhorse not a show horse that was my goal
BKOB-1309||no one was temperamentally more suited to implement such a strategy to my new Chief of Staff Pete routes
BKOB-1310||almost 60 years old grain and built like a panda bear
BKOB-1311||Pete had worked on Capitol Hill for nearly 30 years
BKOB-1312||experience most recently as Chief of Staff to Tom daschle

BKOB-1314||contrary to The Stereotype of Washington political operatives keep was allergic to the spotlight
BKOB-1315||and beneatha draw grass exterior
BKOB-1316||it was almost shy which helped explain is long-term bachelorhood and doting affection for his cats
BKOB-1317||it required considerable effort to convince Pete to take on the job of setting up my rookie office
BKOB-1318||he was less concerned you said with the big step down in status
BKOB-1319||but he was with the possibility that wouldn't leave him enough time to help find jobs for all the junior staffers who in the aftermath of dashiell's defeat
BKOB-1320||we're now unemployed was this unfailing decency and rectitude as much as knowledge that made Pita godson
BKOB-1321||and was on the basis of his reputation but I was able to recruit a top-flight staff to fill out the ranks of my office
BKOB-1322||along with Robert Gibbs communications director we enlisted veteran Hill staffer Chris Lewis legislative director
BKOB-1323||Mark leopard a sharp young naval reserves as a foreign policy staffer
BKOB-1324||Alyssa mastromonaco a top Lieutenant on the Carrie presidential campaign who's Babyface belied and unmatched talent for troubleshooting and organizing events as director of schedule

BKOB-1327||and was both Gibbs and Pete's number one choices are speechwriter
BKOB-1328||I met him before I have Gibbs after the interview
BKOB-1329||isn't it has showed up and told you the Carrie was stealing one of your lines at the convention
BKOB-1331||we instituted a strict policy of avoiding national press and the Sunday morning shows instead of ordering our attention to Illinois
BKOB-1333||people may not like your boats pizza but they'll never accuse you of not answering your mail
BKOB-1334||the office in good hands I could dedicate most of my time to studying the issues and getting to know my fellow senators
BKOB-1335||my task was made easier by the generosity of Illinois senior senator Dick Durbin a friend and disciple Paul Simon's and one of the most gifted Debaters in the Sun
BKOB-1336||in a culture of big egos or Senators generally didn't take kindly to a junior partner soaking up more press than them
BKOB-1337||dick was unfailingly helpful introduced me around the set of train
BKOB-1338||assisted the staff Share Credit with us on various Illinois projects
BKOB-1339||and maintained of patients in Good Humor when at the Thursday morning constituent breakfast we jointly hosted visitors spent much of their time asking me for pictures and autographs

BKOB-1348||offense of overcoming long I'd probably explains why despite our differences in age and experience Terry and I hit it off
BKOB-1349||he wasn't one to show much emotion and in fact had a disconcerting habit of forgoing the normal night season any conversation especially on the phone you might find yourself in mid-sentence only to discover he's already hung up
BKOB-1350||much as email Jones done in the state legislature Harry went out of his way to look out for me when it came to committee assignments and kept me apprised instead of business regardless of my lowly rank
BKOB-1351||in fact such collegiality seem to be the norm
BKOB-1352||the old Bulls of the Senator Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch John Warner and Robert Byrd then annoying and Ted Stevens all maintain friendships across the aisle operating with an easy intimacy that I found typical of the greatest generation
BKOB-1353||the empress enter socialized blush and brought with them the sharper ideological Edge then come to characterize the House of Representatives after the gamer chair

BKOB-1355||Oklahoma's Tom Coburn for example a devout Christian and an unyielding skeptic of government spending would become a sincere and thoughtful friend our staff working together on measures to increase transparency and reduce waste in government contract
BKOB-1356||in many ways my first year in the state of felt a bit like our prize in my early years in the Illinois legislature although the stakes were higher the spotlight brighter than the lobbyists more skilled at wrapping their client's interest in the Garb of grand principles
BKOB-1358||verbosity in law school in Springfield
BKOB-1359||in the minority my fellow Democrats and I have little say on which building merch from committee and got a vote on the senate floor
BKOB-1360||we watched as Republicans put forward budgets that underfunded education or watered-down environmental safeguards feeling helpless beyond the declamation we made before a largely empty chamber and the unblinking eye of C-SPAN
BKOB-1361||repeatedly we agonized over boats the we're not designed to advance our policy so much as to undermine the Democrats and provide fodder for upcoming campaign
BKOB-1362||just as I had an Illinois I tried to do what I could to influence policy at the markets
BKOB-1363||pushing modest nonpartisan measures funding to safeguard against a pandemic outbreak say or the restoration of benefits to a class of Illinois veterans
BKOB-1364||it's frustrating A Certain aspects of the Senate could be
BKOB-1365||I didn't really mind as for Pace as one of its youngest members and what is 70 percent of 4
BKOB-1366||rating back in Illinois I know I could afford to be patient
BKOB-1367||at some point I thought I'd consider running for governor or yes even president feared by the belief that an executive position would give me a better chance to set an agenda
BKOB-1368||but for now 43 years old and just starting out on the national scene
BKOB-1369||I figured I had all the time in the world my mood was further Boyd by improvements on the home phone
BKOB-1370||barring bad weather the commute from d.c. to Chicago took no longer than the trip to and from Springfield and once I was home I wasn't as busy or distracted as I've been during the campaign or while juggling three jobs
BKOB-1371||Leaving Me More Time Shuttle Sasha to dance class on Saturdays or read a chapter of Harry Potter The Melia before I tuck her into bed
BKOB-1372||are proof finances also relieve the whole lot of stress
BKOB-1373||we bought a new house a big handsome Georgia across from the synagogue and kettle
BKOB-1374||4matic price are young family friends and aspiring Chef Named Sam cast agreed to do grocery shopping and cook healthy meals that could stretch through the week

BKOB-1376||Joseph stay out of my part-time driver becoming practically a member of our family
BKOB-1377||most important with financial backstop we could not provide my mother-in-law Marian agreed to reduce her hours at work and help look after the girls
BKOB-1378||wise funny enough to chase after a four and a seven-year-old she made everyone's life easier
BKOB-1379||she also happened to love her son-in-law and would rise to my defense whenever I was late messy
BKOB-1380||or otherwise not up to scratch the additional help gave me and Michelle that extra bit of time together we've been missing for too long
BKOB-1381||we laughed more reminded once again that we were each other's best friend
BKOB-1382||beyond that though what's the prize this was how little we thought change by her new circumstances
BKOB-1383||we continue to be homebodies shying away from glitzy parties and career advancing soirees
BKOB-1384||because we didn't want to give up evenings with the girls because we felt silly getting gussied up to off
BKOB-1385||and because Michelle a perennial early riser got sleepy after 10
BKOB-1386||instead we spent weekends as we always had
BKOB-1387||me playing basketball are taking Malia and Sasha to a nearby pool

BKOB-1391||what known for my organizing days and who consider themselves my surrogate parents in Chicago
BKOB-1392||about to say the Michelle and I didn't have to make adjustments
BKOB-1393||people now recognize this in crowds and as supportive as they generally were we found a sudden loss of anonymity disconcerting
BKOB-1394||one evening shortly after the election Michelle and I went to see the biopic Ray starring Jamie Foxx
BKOB-1395||more surprised when our fellow patrons burst into Applause as we walked into the movie theater
BKOB-1396||sometimes when we went out to dinner we noticed the people at adjoining tables either wanted to strike up long conversations or got very quiet in a not-so-subtle effort to hear what we were saying
BKOB-1397||the girls noticed as well one day during my first summer as a senator I decide to take Malia and Sasha to the Lincoln Park Zoo
BKOB-1398||my signature warned me that the crowds on a beautiful Sunday afternoon might be a little overwhelming but I insisted we make the
BKOB-1399||confident the sunglasses and a baseball cap with Shield me from any attention
BKOB-1400||and for the first half hours so everything went according to plan
BKOB-1401||we visited the Lions prowling behind the glass in the big cat house and made funny faces of the great apes all about a disturbance
BKOB-1402||then every stopped to look at the visitors guide for directions to the sea lions we heard a man shop
BKOB-1403||Obama hey looking for Bona
BKOB-1404||hey Obama can I take a picture with you the next thing I knew we were surrounded by family people reaching for a handshake or an autograph parents arranging their kids next to me for a photo
BKOB-1405||a signal to Mike to take the girls to the sea lions without me
BKOB-1406||like 15 minutes I gave myself over to my constituents appreciative of their encouraging words reminding myself that this was part of what I signed up for
BKOB-1407||I'm feeling my heart sank a little the thought of my daughters wondering what happened to their daddy
BKOB-1408||I finally rejoined my kids and my suggested we leave the zoo and find a quiet place to get some ice cream instead
BKOB-1409||we drove my state mercifully quiet the girls not so much
BKOB-1410||I think you need an alias only have declared from the backseat
BKOB-1411||what's an alias if a fake name you use when you don't want people to know who you are really explain why Johnny McDon John
BKOB-1412||Sasha giggled Johnny John John
BKOB-1413||and you need to disguise your voice Malia added people recognize
BKOB-1414||a talk with a higher voice than faster
BKOB-1415||daddy talks so slow
BKOB-1416||5 percent come on Daddy Melissa
BKOB-1417||he shifted into the highest pitch fastest boy she could muster saying
BKOB-1418||I'm sorry I'm able to contain himself Mike burst out laughing
BKOB-1419||later when we got home Malia probably explains her scheme to Michelle who patted her on the head
BKOB-1420||that's a great idea honey she said but the only way for Daddy to disguise himself as if he has an operation to pin back his ears
BKOB-1421||one feature of the Senate that excited me was the ability of gave me to influence foreign policy
BKOB-1422||bumping that the state legislature didn't afford in college I've been particularly interested nuclear issues
BKOB-1423||so even before my swearing-in I've written to Dick Lugar the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee whose signature issue was nuclear non-proliferation

BKOB-1468||Hurricane Katrina had leveled entire communities along the Gulf Coast overwhelmed levees and left much of New Orleans underwater
BKOB-1469||I stayed up half the night watching the news coverage stunned by the murky primordial nightmare washing cross the television screen
BKOB-1470||reporting corpses elderly patients bath in hospital
BKOB-1471||gunfire and looting refugees huddled and losing hope
BKOB-1472||to see such suffering was bad enough
BKOB-1473||see the slow government response the vulnerability of so many poor and working-class people
BKOB-1474||made me ashamed a few days later I joined George h.w. Bush and Barbara Bush along with Bill and Hillary Clinton
BKOB-1475||in a visit to Houston 1,000 people displaced by the hurricane have been bused to Emergency Shelters set up inside the sprawling Astrodome convention complex
BKOB-1476||got to with red cross and FEMA the city of been working round-the-clock to provide basic necessities
BKOB-1477||but it struck me is I moved from Katakana
BKOB-1478||but many of the people there most of whom were black had been abandoned long before the hurricane
BKOB-1479||scratching out a living on the periphery without savings or insurance
BKOB-1480||I listened to their stories about lost homes and loved ones missing in the flood
BKOB-1481||about their inability to evacuate because they had no car or couldn't move an ailing parent
BKOB-1482||people no different from those at work to organize in Chicago
BKOB-1483||I'm different from some of Michelle's ons for cousin
BKOB-1484||I was reminded that no matter how my circumstances may have changed
BKOB-1485||Bears had not politics of the country had not
BKOB-1486||forgotten people and forgotten voices remained everywhere neglected by government that often appeared blind or indifferent to their needs
BKOB-1487||I felt their hardship as a rebuke and as the only African-American in the Senate I decided it was time to end my moratorium on National media appearances
BKOB-1488||I have the network news shows arguing that while I didn't believe racism was the reason for the botched response to the Katrina disaster
BKOB-1489||it does speak to how little the ruling party and America's a whole and invested in tackling the isolation
BKOB-1490||intergenerational poverty and lack of opportunities the persistent and large swathes of the country
BKOB-1491||back in Washington works with my colleagues drafting plans to help rebuild the Gulf region is part of the homeland security and governmental Affairs committee
BKOB-1492||but life of aesthetic felt different how many years in that chamber would it take to actually make a difference in the lives of the people I met in Houston
BKOB-1493||how many committee hearings failed amendments in budget Provisions negotiated with a recalcitrant chairman would be required to offset the misguided actions of a single FEMA director Environmental Protection Agency functionary or Department of Labor appointee
BKOB-1494||feelings of impatience were compounded when a few months later I joined a small Congressional Delegation on a visit to Iraq
BKOB-1495||nearly three years after the US LED Invasion the administration could no longer deny the disaster the word become
BKOB-1496||understanding the araki military and allowing the shield majority to aggressively remove large numbers of Sunni Muslims from government positions
BKOB-1497||officials have created a situation that was chaotic and increasingly perilous a bloody sectarian conflict Mark by escalating suicide assault roadside explosions and car bombs detonating on crowded Market Street
BKOB-1498||our group visited u.s. military bases in Baghdad Fallujah and kirkuk
BKOB-1499||and from the Blackhawk helicopters that carried us the entire country looked exhausted
BKOB-1500||the city's pockmarked by mortar fire the roads eerily quiet
BKOB-1501||landscape coated with dust restock we met commanders and troops were smart and courageous driven by the conviction that with the right amount of Military Support Technical Training and elbow grease and Rocket someday turn the corner
BKOB-1502||my conversations with journalist and with a handful of high-ranking Rocky officials told a different story
BKOB-1503||Wicked Spirits have been Unleashed they said the killings were privatized between Sunni and Shiite meghna Prospect
BKOB-1504||Malaysian Disston if not unattainable
BKOB-1505||the only thing holding the country together appeared to be the thousands of young soldiers and Marines we deployed
BKOB-1506||many of them barely out of high school more than 2,000 of them had been killed already
BKOB-1507||and many thousands more injured it seems clear that the longer the war dragged on the more troops would become the targets of an enemy they often could not see and did not understand
BKOB-1508||going back to the United States I couldn't shake the thought of those kits paying the price for the arrogance of men like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld
BKOB-1509||rushed in the war based on faulty information and refused still to fully consider the consequences
BKOB-1510||the fact that more than half of my Democratic colleagues had approved the Fiasco filled me with an altogether different kind of worried
BKOB-1511||I questioned what might happen to me the longer I stayed in Washington
BKOB-1512||the more better than comfortable I became
BKOB-1513||I found out how it could happen how the incremental ISM indecorum damage positioning for the next election
BKOB-1514||and the group think of cable news panels all conspired to chip away at your best instincts and wear down your Independence
BKOB-1515||do whatever you wants believed was utterly lost
BKOB-1516||I've been on the edge of feeling content thinking I was in the right job doing the right thing at an acceptable pace
BKOB-1517||Katrina and my rock visit but stopped all that
BKOB-1518||change needed to come faster and I was going to have to decide what role I would play and bringing it about
BKOB-1519||chapter 40b when I don't run into somebody a friend to supporter an acquaintance or a total stranger
BKOB-1520||who insisted from the first time they met me or heard me speak on TV they knew I'd be present
BKOB-1521||they told me this with affection conviction and a certain amount of pride in their political Acumen Talent spotting or Suisun
BKOB-1522||sometimes they will close it in religious terms
BKOB-1523||God has a plan for you don't tell me I'll smile and say that I wish that they told me this back when I was thinking about running it would have saved me a lot of stress and stuff.
BKOB-1524||the truth is I've never been a big believer in Destiny
BKOB-1525||I worried that it encourages resignation in the down-and-out
BKOB-1526||and complacency among the powerful I suspect that God's plan whatever it is worse on a scale too large to admit our mortal tribulation
BKOB-1527||that interesting a lifetime accidents and happenstance determine more than we care to admit
BKOB-1528||and the best we can do is try to line ourselves with what we feel is right and construct some meaning out of our confusion
BKOB-1529||and with Grace and nerve play at each moment the hand that weirdo
BKOB-1530||by the spring of 2006 the idea of me running for president in the next election while still unlikely no longer felt outside the realm of possibility
BKOB-1531||each day our Senate Office was inundated with media requests
BKOB-1532||we were getting twice as much mail is other Senators every state partying in candidate for the November midterm election wanted me to headline their events
BKOB-1533||and I wrote the Niles but I was planning to run only seemed to fuel speculation
BKOB-1534||one afternoon Petros walked into my office and close the door behind them
BKOB-1535||I want to ask you something he said I looked up from the constituent letters I've been signing
BKOB-1536||if your plans change for 2008
BKOB-1537||I don't know sugar Peach truck
BKOB-1538||I think the original plan to stay out of the Limelight and focus on Illinois made sense
BKOB-1539||your profile is not going down if there's even a remote chance you're considering him I'd like to write a memo
BKOB-1540||wanting what we need to do to keep your options open
BKOB-1541||you all right with that I leaned back in my chair and stared at the ceiling knowing the implications of my answer
BKOB-1542||makes sense I finally said okay.
BKOB-1543||okay I nodded returning to my paperwork
BKOB-1544||the memo Master without some of the staff referred to
BKOB-1545||his hands the lowly memorandum approached an art form
BKOB-1546||each one efficient and oddly inspiring
BKOB-1547||a few days later he distributed the revived roadmap for the remainder of the year for my senior team to consider
BKOB-1548||call Fern expanded travel schedule to support more democratic candidates in the midterms
BKOB-1549||meetings with influential party officials and donors and a ritual stump speech
BKOB-1550||the month to come I followed this plan putting myself in my ideas before new audiences lending my support the Democrats in swing States and swing districts and traveling to parts of the country I've never been
BKOB-1551||before the West Virginia Jefferson Jackson dinner to the Nebraska Morrison Exxon there we hit them all back in the house and rallying the troops
BKOB-1552||anytime someone asked if I was going to run for president though I continue to demur
BKOB-1553||right now I'm just focused on getting Ben Nelson back to the Senate where we need him
BKOB-1554||fooling them by pulling myself
BKOB-1555||sorry to say I was testing I suppose probing
BKOB-1556||trying to square what I was seeing and feeling of a traveled around the country with the absurdity of my launching a national campaign
BKOB-1557||I knew that a viable presidential candidacy wasn't something you just fell into
BKOB-1558||damn right it was a deeply strategic Endeavor that's slowly and quietly overtime
BKOB-1559||requiring not only confidence and conviction but also piles of money and enough commitment and Goodwill from others to carry you through all 50 states and two straight years of primaries and caucuses
BKOB-1560||already a number of my fellow Democratic senators Joe Biden Chris Dodd and by and of course Hillary Clinton had laid the groundwork for a possible run
BKOB-1561||Summit run before all had been preparing for years and have a season Cadre of Staff donors and local officials lined up to help
BKOB-1562||I'm like me most points were record of meaningful legislative accomplishments
BKOB-1563||and I like them they treated me well
BKOB-1564||probably shared my views on the issues and we're more than capable of running an effective campaign and beyond that unaffected White House
BKOB-1565||if I was becoming convinced that I could excite voters in ways that they couldn't
BKOB-1566||if I suspected that only a wider Coalition than they could build a different language than they used to shake up Washington and give hope to those in need
BKOB-1567||I also understood that my favorite status was partly an illusion result of friendly Mediacom
BKOB-1568||animal restrict appetite for anything new
BKOB-1569||the infatuation could reverse itself in an instant I know
BKOB-1570||Rising Star transformed into the callow youth presumptuous enough to think he could run the country less than halfway through his first term
BKOB-1571||better hold off I told myself pay dues collection it's wait my turn
BKOB-1572||are bright spring afternoon Harry Reid asked me to stop by his office
BKOB-1573||I trudged up the white marble stairs from the Senate chamber to the second floor
BKOB-1574||I'm smiling dark-eyed portraits of long-dead men staring down upon me with each step
BKOB-1575||are greeted me and the reception area and let me into his office a big high-ceiling room with the same intricate moldings tile work and spectacular views that other senior Senators enjoy
BKOB-1576||short on memorabilia or photographs of handshakes with the famous that adorned other offices
BKOB-1577||let me get to the point Harry said is everywhere known for small talk
BKOB-1578||we got a lot of people in our caucus playing to run for president
BKOB-1579||I can hardly countable and they're good people bro
BKOB-1580||so I can't be out there publicly taking socks
BKOB-1581||what's Mary just so you know I'm not but he said cutting me off
BKOB-1582||I think you need to consider running this site
BKOB-1583||I know you said you wouldn't do it and Shore lot of people will say you need more experience
BKOB-1584||but let me tell you something ten more years in the Senate will make you a better
BKOB-1585||you get people motivated especially young people minorities
BKOB-1586||even though the road white people that's different you see
BKOB-1587||people are looking for something different sure it'll be hard
BKOB-1588||I think you can win Schumer think so too
BKOB-1589||he stood up and headed toward the door making it clear the meeting was over
BKOB-1590||well that's all I want to tell you something about it okay
BKOB-1592||good relationship if I develop with Carrie I knew him to be the most practical the politician
BKOB-1593||walking down the stairs I wondered if there was some angle to what he had said some sophisticated game he was playing but I was too dim to recognize
BKOB-1594||later talk to Chuck Schumer and then to Dick Durbin they delivered the same message
BKOB-1595||country was desperate for new voice I would never be in a better position to run that I was now and with my connection with the young voters minorities in Independence I might broaden the map and way that could help other Democrats down the ballet
BKOB-1596||I didn't share these conversations beyond my senior staff and closest friends
BKOB-1597||feeling as if I'd stepped into a Minefield and should make any sudden moves
BKOB-1598||as I molded all over with Pete he suggested I have one more conversation before I consider taking a more serious look at what a race would entail
BKOB-1599||you need to talk to Canada he said he knows all the players he's running self
BKOB-1600||I'll give you some perspective and at the very least he'll tell you if he plans to support anyone else
BKOB-1601||heir to the most famous name in American politics Ted Kennedy with Vivan the closest thing Washington had to living legend
BKOB-1602||more than four decades in the Senate he'd been at the Forefront of every major Progressive cost from civil rights to the minimum wage to healthcare
BKOB-1603||the great bulk huge head and Main whitehair he filled every room he walked into was the rarest editor who commanded attention whenever he gingerly Rose from his seat in the chamber searching a suit pocket for his glasses or his notes
BKOB-1604||that iconic Boston baritone launching each speech with thank you madam president
BKOB-1605||the argument what I'm supposed to Face Redmond moisturizing building to a crescendo like a revivalist sermon no matter how Monday in the issue at hand
BKOB-1606||and then the speech would end up hurting would come down
BKOB-1607||and you would become the old avuncular Teddy again wandering down the aisle to check on the roll call or sit next to a colleague his hand on his shoulder forearm with bringing their ear or breaking into a hearty laugh
BKOB-1608||I kind of made you not care that it was probably softening you up for some future boat he might need
BKOB-1609||text office on third floor of the Russell Senate Office Building with reflection of the man
BKOB-1610||charming and full of History its walls cluttered with photographs of Camelot and models of sailboats and paintings of Cape Cod
BKOB-1611||one thing in particular caught my attention of dark Jagged rocks curling against the choppy white capsule
BKOB-1612||Premier long time to get that one right Teddy said coming up beside me three or four tries
BKOB-1613||is worth the effort I said we sat down in his inner sanctum with the shades drawn in the stoplight and he began telling stories
BKOB-1614||about stealing his children and various fights he looked through on the senate floor
BKOB-1616||historic occasionally drift along some unrelated current before tacking back to his original course I'm done soldering just a fragment of thought all the while both was knowing that this was a performance
BKOB-1617||we're just circling the real purpose of my visit so he said finally I hear there's talk of you running for president
BKOB-1618||I told him I was unlikely but that I never left wanted his counsel
BKOB-1619||that's well who was it who said There 100 Senators to look in the mirror and see a president that he chuckled to himself
BKOB-1620||they ask why I want to text Jack mommy me to Longo
BKOB-1621||didn't go as planned but things worked out in their own way I suppose
BKOB-1622||trailed off lost in his thoughts watching them I wondered how he took the measure of his own life
BKOB-1623||his brothers life's the terrible price each of the men paid in pursuit of a dream
BKOB-1624||then just as suddenly he was back his deep blue eyes fixed on
BKOB-1625||all business I won't be waiting in Early Texas
BKOB-1626||too many friends but I can tell you that bro
BKOB-1627||power to inspire is rare moments like this are rare
BKOB-1628||you think you might not be ready but you'll do it more convenient time
BKOB-1629||don't choose the time time chooses you
BKOB-1630||if you sees what may turn out to be the only chance you have or you decide you're willing to live with the knowledge
BKOB-1631||but the chance but passed you by Michelle was hardly oblivious to what was happening
BKOB-1632||the first you simply ignore the fuss she stopped watching political news shows and waved off all the overeager questions from friends and coworkers about whether I was playing the Run
BKOB-1633||when one evening at home I mentioned the conversation I've had with Harry she just Shrugged
BKOB-1634||and I did not press the issue as a summer war on though the chatter began to seep through the cracks and crevices of our home life
BKOB-1635||our evenings and weekends at your normal so long as Malia and Sasha were swirling about
BKOB-1636||but I thought the tension whenever Michelle and I were alone
BKOB-1637||finally one night after the girls were asleep I came into the den where she was watching TV and muted the sound
BKOB-1638||you know I didn't plan any of this I said sitting down next to her on the couch
BKOB-1639||Michelle started the Silent Scream I know she said
BKOB-1640||I realize we barely had time to catch our breath and until a few months ago the idea of me Running Scene crazy
BKOB-1641||given everything that's happened I feel like we got to give the ideas serious look
BKOB-1642||I left the team to put together presentation what campaign schedule would look like whether we could win
BKOB-1643||add might affect the family I mean if we're ever going to do this
BKOB-1644||don't cut me off for voice choked with emotion
BKOB-1645||did you say we she said you mean you Barack
BKOB-1646||this is your thing
BKOB-1647||I supported you the whole time because I believe in you even though I hate politics
BKOB-1648||hate the way it exposes our family know that
BKOB-1649||now finally we have some stability even if it's still not normal. The way I choose Brussels live and now you tell me you're going to run for president
BKOB-1650||I reached for a hand and say I am running honey I just said we can't dismiss the possibility
BKOB-1651||but I can only consider that your onboard I paused saying that none of her anger was dissipating
BKOB-1652||if you don't think we should then we won't simple as that you get the final say
BKOB-1653||show lifted her eyebrows if to suggest you didn't believe me
BKOB-1654||if that's really true then the answer is no
BKOB-1655||I don't want you to run for president at least I'm not
BKOB-1656||give me a hard-looking got up from the couch Brock going to be
BKOB-1657||before I can answer she got into the bedroom and close the door
BKOB-1658||how could I blame her for feeling this way
BKOB-1659||even suggesting the possibility of a run by involving my staff before I'd ask for her blessing
BKOB-1660||I put her in an impossible spot for years now and ask Michelle for fortitude in forbearance when it came to my political endeavors
BKOB-1661||reluctantly but with love
BKOB-1662||and then each time I come back again asking for more
BKOB-1663||why would I put her through this we just vanity
BKOB-1664||or perhaps something darker I lost hunger blind ambition trapped in the Ghazi language of service
BKOB-1665||will I still try to prove myself worthy to a father who abandoned me
BKOB-1666||live up to my mother's starry-eyed expectations for only son
BKOB-1667||resolve whatever self-doubt remain from being born the child of mixed race
BKOB-1668||like you have a hole to fill michella told me early in our marriage that's a stretch in which it watched me work myself to near exhaustion
BKOB-1669||why you can't slow down in truth I thought I'd resolve those issues long ago finding affirmation in my work security and love in my family
BKOB-1670||but I wondered now if I could ever really Escape whatever it was in me that needed heal
BKOB-1671||whatever kept me reaching for more maybe it was impossible to disentangle one's motor
BKOB-1672||I will call the sermon by dr. Martin Luther King jr. call the drum major instinct
BKOB-1673||he talks about how deep down we all want to be first celebrated for a greater we all want to leave the parade
BKOB-1674||he goes on to point out that such selfish impulses can be reconciled by aligning that quest for greatness but more stuff lesane
BKOB-1675||you can try to be first in Service First In Love
BKOB-1676||for me it seemed to satisfying way to square the circle when it came to women baser and higher instincts
BKOB-1677||but now I was also confronting the obvious fact that the sacrifices were never mine alone
BKOB-1678||we got dragged along for the ride
BKOB-1679||put in the line of fire dr. King's cause and his gifts might justify such sacrifice
BKOB-1681||whatever the nature of my faith I couldn't take refuge in the notion of God calling me to run for president
BKOB-1682||I can pretend to be simply responding to some invisible pull of the universe
BKOB-1683||I can claim I was indispensable to the cause of freedom and justice
BKOB-1684||or deny responsibility for the burden I be placing on my family
BKOB-1685||circumstances may have opened the door to a presidential race
BKOB-1686||but nothing during these monster prevented me from closing
BKOB-1687||I could easily close the door still in the fact that I hadn't
BKOB-1688||instead I allow the door to open wider
BKOB-1689||was all Michelle needed to know if one of the qualifications running for the most powerful office in the world with megalomania
BKOB-1690||it appeared I was past in the past
BKOB-1691||SpongeBob colored my mood is I left in August for 17-day tour through Africa
BKOB-1692||in South Africa I took a boat ride out to Robben Island and stood in the tiny cell where Nelson Mandela had passed most of the 27 years in prison keeping his faith the change would come
BKOB-1693||I met with members of the South African Supreme Court spoke with doctors and HIV AIDS clinic and spend time with Bishop Desmond Tutu cuz joyful Spirit I've gotten to know during his visit to Washington
BKOB-1694||so is the true mother he said with a smile that you are going to be a first African president of the United States
BKOB-1695||that would make us all very proud from South Africa to Nairobi where Michelle and the girls accompanied by her friend Anita Blanchard and her children join me
BKOB-1696||the better by wall-to-wall coverage and local press the Kenyan response to our presence was over-the-top
BKOB-1697||this dab one of Africa's largest shantytowns Drew thousands packed themselves along the winding Paths of Red Dirt chanting my name
BKOB-1698||my ass is drama thoughtfully organized the family trip to nyanza Province so we can introduce Malia and Sasha to our father's ancestral home in the western region the country
BKOB-1699||traveling there we were surprised to see people lined up and waving along miles of Highway
BKOB-1700||and when Michelle and I stopped at the mobile Health Clinic to publicly take an HIV test as a means of demonstrating its safety
BKOB-1701||crowd of thousands showed up swapping our vehicle and giving the Diplomatic Security team a real scare
BKOB-1702||only one we were on Safari Park to mine the Lions and wildebeest that we escaped the commotion
BKOB-1703||I swear Barack these folks think you're already present I need a joke one evening just Reserve me a seat on Air Force One okay
BKOB-1704||how to Michelle Nori lap I continued on traveling to the
BKOB-1705||is Molly border get briefed on us Kenya cooperation against the terrorist group al-shabaab
BKOB-1706||taking a helicopter from Djibouti to Ethiopia where US military personnel were assisting flood relief efforts
BKOB-1707||and finally flying into Chad to visit refugees from Darfur
BKOB-1708||at least stop by some men and women engaged in heroic work
BKOB-1709||impossible circumstances that he stopped I was told how much more America could be doing to help relieve the supper
BKOB-1710||entity stop I was asked if I was running for president
BKOB-1711||just days after my return to the states include Iowa to give the keynote speech Senator Tom Harkin's annual steak fry a ritual that took on added importance in the run-up to the presidential elections given the Iowa was always the first day to vote in the primary process
BKOB-1712||I accepted the invitation months earlier, asked me to speak precisely to avoid having to choose between all the presidential aspirants who coveted the slot
BKOB-1713||but not my only fuel speculation
BKOB-1714||as we were leaving the fairgrounds following my speech I was pulled aside by Steve Hildebrand
BKOB-1715||former political director for the Democratic senatorial Campaign Committee and an old Iowa hand who'd been in Lifted by Pete to show me around
BKOB-1716||at the hottest reception I've ever seen here Steve said
BKOB-1717||you can win Iowa Brock if I can feel it if you win Iowa
BKOB-1718||you can win the nomination it's don't sometimes as if I've been caught in a Time carried Along by the current of other people's expectations before I clearly defined my own
BKOB-1719||the temperature Rose even higher one month later just a few weeks before the midterm elections my second book was released
BKOB-1720||I'd labor not at all year in the evenings and my DC apartment and on weekends after Michelle and the girls are going to sleep
BKOB-1721||even in Djibouti right scrambled for several hours trying to fax corrected papers to my
BKOB-1722||I never intended the book to serve as a campaign Manifesto
BKOB-1723||I just want to present my ideas about the current state of American politics and interesting way and saw enough copies to justify my sizable advance
BKOB-1724||but that wasn't how it was received by the political press or the public
BKOB-1725||promoting Ant-Man I was on television and radio practically nonstop
BKOB-1726||and combined with my very visible barnstorming on behalf of congressional candidates I look more and more like a candidate myself
BKOB-1727||on a drive down from Philly to d.c. was scheduled to appear the next morning on Meet the Press
BKOB-1728||give Xanax along with axes business partner David plus asked me what I plan to say when the show's host Tim Russert inevitably grilled me about my plans
BKOB-1729||he's going to run back the old take
BKOB-1730||the one where you say unequivocally you will not run for president 2008
BKOB-1731||I wasn't for a few minutes and three of them began hashing out various ways to sidestep the question before I interrupt
BKOB-1732||why don't I just tell the truth can I just say that I had no intention of running two years ago but circumstances have changed and so has my thinking and I plan to give it serious thought after the midterms are over
BKOB-1733||they like the idea that medicine but it said something about the strangeness of politics that such a straightforward answer would be considered novel
BKOB-1734||Gibbs also advised that I give Michelle a heads up predicting that a direct suggestion that I might run would cause a media frenzy to immediately intensify
BKOB-1735||which is exactly what happened my mission on Meet the Press made headlines and the evening news
BKOB-1736||on the internet draft Obama petition took off Gathering thousands of signatures
BKOB-1737||National columnists including several conservative ones and op-eds urging me to run
BKOB-1738||Time Magazine published a cover story titled why Barack Obama could be the next president
BKOB-1739||apparently though not everyone was sold on my prospects
BKOB-1740||get reported too when he stops at the kiosk on Michigan Avenue to go
BKOB-1741||copy of time the indian-american vendor looked out of my picture and offered a two-word response
BKOB-1742||fuck that with a good laugh over this
BKOB-1743||speculation about my cannabis negro Gibson I would repeat the phrase like an incantation
BKOB-1744||one that helped maintain our grasp on reality and ward off the growing sense that events were moving beyond our control
BKOB-1745||proud of my final stop before the midterm elections and evening rally in Iowa City in support of the Democratic candidate for governor was especially raucous
BKOB-1746||standing on the stage and looking out of the thousands of people gathered their the breath Rising like Mr The Click lights the face is turned up an expectation that you're drowning out my Haggard voice
BKOB-1747||I felt as if I were watching a scene in the movie The figure on stage not my own
BKOB-1748||when I got home late that night my house was dark and Michelle was already asleep
BKOB-1749||after taking a shower and going through a stack of mail I slipped under the covers and began drifting off
BKOB-1750||that liminal space between wakefulness and sleep
BKOB-1751||imagine myself stepping toward the portal of some store
BKOB-1752||bright and cold an airless Place uninhabited and severed from the world
BKOB-1753||find me out of the darkness I Heard a Voice sharp and clear
BKOB-1754||if someone were right next to me I dream the same word again and again
BKOB-1756||no I jolted out of bed my heart racing and went downstairs to pour myself a drink
BKOB-1757||I sat alone in the dark sipping vodka my nerves jangled my brain sudden Overdrive
BKOB-1758||my deepest fear turned out was no longer of their relevance
BKOB-1759||or being stuck in the senate or even losing a presidential race
BKOB-1760||fear came from the realization that I could win
BKOB-1761||riding a wave of antipathy towards the Bush Administration in the war in Iraq
BKOB-1762||Democrats swept just about every important contest in November winning control of both the house and the Senate
BKOB-1763||it's hard as we work to help achieve these results my team and I had no time to celebrate
BKOB-1764||instead starting the day after the election we began charting a possible path to the White House
BKOB-1765||upholster Paul haarstad went through the numbers and found me already among the first year candidates
BKOB-1766||we discussed the primary and caucus calendar understanding that front upstart campaign like mine everything will depend on winning the early States especially Iowa
BKOB-1767||we ran through what a realistic budget might look like and how we go about raising the hundreds of millions of dollars would take just to win the Democratic nomination
BKOB-1768||Pete and Alyssa presented plans for juggling my spinner duties with campaign Trail
BKOB-1769||Axelrod wrote a memo outlining the theme Dental
BKOB-1770||and how given voters utter contempt for Washington my message of change could compensate for my obvious lack of experience
BKOB-1771||despite how little time they had everyone had carried out their assignments with thoroughness and care
BKOB-1773||I bet listing 1-day is he mapped out how we might power a Grassroots state-by-state organizing effort using both our volunteer base and the internet
BKOB-1774||and later I told Pete that if we did this place seems like the Clear Choice for campaign manager
BKOB-1775||is excellent pizza it might take some convincing though he's got a young family
BKOB-1776||this was one of the more striking things about our discussions that month
BKOB-1777||the entire team displayed in ambivalence that match my own
BKOB-1778||it wasn't just my candidacy remained a long shot
BKOB-1779||fnac strawberry blunt insane but for me to beat Hillary Clinton a national brand
BKOB-1780||have to pitch close to a perfect game know what gave the more pause was the fact that I like me dance scene presidential campaigns up close
BKOB-1781||they knew all too well the grueling nature of the Enterprise
BKOB-1782||I understood the toilet would take my just on me and my family but I'm damn in their families as well
BKOB-1783||beyond the road constantly the Press would be merciless in scrutiny
BKOB-1784||non-stop calling oscopy I believe it's called
BKOB-1785||I see very little of Michelle or the kids for a year at least 2 years if we're lucky enough to win the primer
BKOB-1786||I'll be honest bro that's told me after 1 meeting
BKOB-1787||the process can be exhilarating but it's mostly misery like
BKOB-1788||Greta and EKG on the stove
BKOB-1789||and for all your talent I don't know how you'll respond
BKOB-1790||neither do you the whole thing's so crazy so undignified and brutal do you have to be a low pathological to do what it takes to win
BKOB-1791||I just don't know if you've got that hunger in you I don't think you'll be unhappy if you never become
BKOB-1792||that's true I said I know it is access
BKOB-1793||and as a person that's a strength but for a candidate it's a weakness
BKOB-1794||you may be a little too normal to well-adjusted to run for
BKOB-1795||and all the political consultant in me thinks it would be a thrill to see you do this
BKOB-1796||Department that your friend kind of hopes you don't Michelle meanwhile was also sorting out her feelings
BKOB-1797||you listened quietly during meetings occasionally asking about the campaign calendar
BKOB-1798||what would be expected of her and what it might mean for the girls
BKOB-1799||gradually her resistance to the idea of me running has subsided
BKOB-1800||Preston help to hear the unvarnished truth what a campaign entail
BKOB-1801||our worst fears rendered concrete and specific and therefore more manageable
BKOB-1802||maybe was a conversation she had with Valerie and Marty two of our most loyal friends people whose judgment she implicitly Trust
BKOB-1803||or the Niger that she got from her brother Craig someone who has pursued his own unlikely drinks
BKOB-1804||first to play professional basketball in later to become a coach even though it meant giving up a lucrative career in banking
BKOB-1805||she's just scared you told me over a beer one afternoon
BKOB-1806||you going to describe how Michelle and her mother used to watch his high-school basketball games but if the score got even a little close they leave and go wait in the tunnel the two of them too tense to stay in their seats
BKOB-1807||they don't want to see me lose Craig said they don't want to see me hurt or disappointed
BKOB-1808||I had to explain that a competition he was in favor mean
BKOB-1809||my shot of presidency and he said he planned to talk it over with his sister
BKOB-1810||quarter to see the bigger picture he said the chance to compete at this level isn't something you can pass up
BKOB-1811||one day in December just ahead of our holiday trip to Hawaii or what was to be the final meeting before I decided whether to move forward or not
BKOB-1812||Michelle patiently endured an hour-long discussion on Staffing in the logistics of dental announcement before cutting in with an essential question
BKOB-1813||you said there a lot of other Democrats were capable of winning an election and being present
BKOB-1814||you told me the only reason for you to run is if you could provide something that others can't
BKOB-1815||otherwise it's not worth it right I nodded
BKOB-1816||my question is why you Brock IV you need to be president
BKOB-1817||we looked at each other across the table for MoMA
BKOB-1818||it was as if we were alone in the room by my foot back to the moment 17 years earlier when we first met
BKOB-1819||me arriving late to our office load them from the rain
BKOB-1820||show rising up from her desk so lovely and self-possessed in a lawyer Lee blouse and skirt
BKOB-1821||the easy batter the Fallen I've seen those round dark eyes of hers a vulnerability that I knew she rarely let show
BKOB-1822||I knew even then that she was special but I would need to know her
BKOB-1823||this was a woman I could love how lucky I have been active
BKOB-1824||I took myself out of the record
BKOB-1825||bright I said why me I mentioned several of the reasons we talked about before
BKOB-1826||but I might be able to spark a new kind of politics
BKOB-1827||or get a new generations participate or Bridge the divisions in the country better than other candidates
BKOB-1828||but who knows I said looking around the table there's no guarantee we can pull it off
BKOB-1829||here's one thing I know for sure though I know that the day I raise my
BKOB-1830||right hand and take the oath to be president of the United States
BKOB-1831||the world will start looking at America differently
BKOB-1832||I know the kids all around this country black kids expanded kids kids who don't fit in
BKOB-1833||they'll see themselves differently to the horizons lifted the possibilities expand
BKOB-1834||and that alone would be worth
BKOB-1835||quiet Marty smile
BKOB-1836||Valerie was tearing up I see different members the team Conjuring it in their minds
BKOB-1837||the swearing-in of the first African-American president of the United States
BKOB-1838||Michelle stared at me for what felt like an eternity well honey she said finally
BKOB-1839||that was pretty good answer everyone laughed in the meeting moved on to other business
BKOB-1840||and yours to come those have been in the room with sometimes make reference to that meeting
BKOB-1841||understanding the my answer to my first question had been an impromptu articulation of a shared faith
BKOB-1842||the thing that it launched its all on what would be a long rough and improbable Journey
BKOB-1843||they would remember it when they saw a little boy touch my hair in the Oval Office or 1A teacher reported that the kids in her Intercity class and start studying harder after I was elected
BKOB-1844||and it's true and answering Michelle's question I was anticipating the ways in which I hope to even incredible campaign might Shake loose some vestiges of America's racial past
BKOB-1845||finally I knew that getting there also meant something more personal
BKOB-1846||we won I thought it would mean that my US Senate campaign hadn't just been dumb luck
BKOB-1847||if we wanted would mean the what had led me into politics wasn't just a pipe dream
BKOB-1848||the America I believe in was possible
BKOB-1849||that the Democracy I believed in was Within Reach
BKOB-1851||it would mean that I wasn't alone in believing that the world didn't have to be a cold unforgiving place
BKOB-1852||the strong prey on the weak and we inevitably fell back in the Clans and tribes lashing out against the unknown and huddling against the darkness
BKOB-1853||these beliefs were made manifest in my own life made sense
BKOB-1854||nikodem pass on that promise that version of the world
BKOB-1855||my children I have made a long time ago
BKOB-1856||and this was the point of Reckoning I was about to step over some invisible line
BKOB-1857||wonderwood inexorably change my life in ways I couldn't get imagine anyways I might not like
BKOB-1858||Stop Now to turn back now
BKOB-1859||lose my nerve now that was unacceptable
BKOB-1860||I had to see how this whole thing play.
BKOB-1861||part 2 yes we can chapter 5
BKOB-1862||on a bright February morning in 2007 I stood on a stage before the old state capitol in Springfield
BKOB-1863||same spot where Abe Lincoln and delivered his house divided speech while serving in the Illinois State Legislature
BKOB-1864||and announced my candidacy for president
BKOB-1865||what temperature is Enloe teams we've been worried that the cold might scare people off but by the time I stepped up to the microphone
BKOB-1866||more than 15,000 people gathered in the plaza and adjoining streets all of them in a festive mood bundled and Parker's scarves ski caps near muffs
BKOB-1867||many of them hoisting handmade or campaign provided Obama sign their Collective breath hovering like patches of clouds
BKOB-1868||my speech Terry live on cable TV captured our campaigns big scene
BKOB-1869||the need for fundamental change the needs a pack of long-term problems like Healthcare in climate change
BKOB-1870||need to move past the tired Washington partisan divide
BKOB-1871||the need for an Engaged and active citizenry Michelle and the girls join me onstage to wave at the Roaring crowd when I was finished
BKOB-1872||the massive American flags hanging across nearby buildings making for a spectacular backdrop
BKOB-1873||and I flew to Iowa where in 11 months the nation's first contest for the nomination would take place
BKOB-1874||and where we were counting on early Victory to catapult those Passmore seasoned opponents
BKOB-1875||a series of town hall meetings we once again greeted by thousands of supporters and curiosity Seekers
BKOB-1876||backstage at an event in Cedar Rapids Iowa heard of Veteran Iowa political operative explain to one of the fifty or so National reporters were following us that this is not normal
BKOB-1877||looking at the footage from that day it's hard not to get swept up in the Nostalgia that still holds sway over my Pharmacy
BKOB-1878||and supporters the feeling that we are kick-starting a magical ride
BKOB-1879||but over the course of two years we would catch lightning in a bottle and tap into something essential and true about America
BKOB-1880||while the crowd the excitement the media attention of that day off for shadowed my viability in the race
BKOB-1881||remind myself that nothing felt easy or predestined that the pie
BKOB-1882||that again to get it felt as if our campaign would go in tireli off the rail
BKOB-1883||and that at the outset it seem not to me but many who were paying attention and I wasn't a particularly good candidate
BKOB-1884||many ways my problems were a direct outgrowth of the buzz we generated and the expectations that came with
BKOB-1885||Zacks explained most presidential campaigns by necessity starts small
BKOB-1886||Off-Broadway he called it small crowds small venues covered by local networks and small papers for the candidate and his or her team could test line smooth
BKOB-1887||commit a pratfall or work through about a stage-fright without attracting much notice
BKOB-1888||you didn't have that luxury from day one felt like the middle of Times Square and under the glare of the spotlight my inexperience showed
BKOB-1889||my staff's biggest fear was that I'd make a gaff
BKOB-1890||expression used by the press to describe any maladroit phrase by the candidate reveals ignorance carelessness fuzzy thinking and sensitivity malice boredness falsehood or hypocrisy
BKOB-1891||where is simply Dean severe sufficiently far from conventional wisdom to make said candidate vulnerable to attack
BKOB-1892||digest definition most humans won't commit 9:55 gas today
BKOB-1893||each of accounting on the forbearance and Goodwill of our family co-workers and friends to fill in the blanks catch your drift and generally assume the best rather than the worse than us
BKOB-1894||as a result my initial instincts were to dismiss the mighty Miss morning
BKOB-1895||on our way to our final stop in Iowa on mouseman day for example
BKOB-1896||ask Gwen Stefani briefing book you know he said the town we're going to is pronounced Waterloo
BKOB-1897||right I said Waterloo extra cassette know it's Waterloo not Waterloo
BKOB-1898||do that for me again Waterloo accent is what the person just said
BKOB-1900||okay Brock this is serious it didn't take long. Appreciate that the minute you announce your candidacy for president the normal rules of speech no longer apply
BKOB-1901||the microphones were everywhere and every word coming out of your mouth was recorded Amplified scrutinized and i s
BKOB-1902||at the Town Hall in Ames Iowa on that first post announcement or
BKOB-1903||I was explaining my opposition for Warner Rock when I got sloppy and said that the Bush Administration poorly thought-out decision that resulted in more than three
BKOB-1904||thousand of our young fruit flies being quote wasted
BKOB-1905||the second I heard the word I regretted it that always been careful to distinguish between my views on the war and my appreciation for the sacrifices of our troops and their families
BKOB-1906||only a few press Outlets picked up my blender and a quick Maricopa Tamp down any controversy
BKOB-1907||but it was a reminder that words carried a different weight than before and is I imagine how my carelessness might impact the family still grieving over the loss of a loved one my heart sing
BKOB-1908||my naturama delivered speaker which by the standards of presidential candidates helped keep my Gap quotient relatively low
BKOB-1909||but my care Woodward's raised another issue on the campaign Trail
BKOB-1910||I was just plain wordy and that was a problem
BKOB-1911||when asked a question I tended to offer circuitous and ponderous answers my mind instinctively breaking up every issue into a pile of components and sub-components
BKOB-1912||every argument has two sides I usually came up with for
BKOB-1913||if there was an exception to some statement I just made I won just pointed out I provide footnotes
BKOB-1914||you're burying the lede ex was practically shout after listening to me drone on and on and on
BKOB-1915||birthday or two I obediently focused on brevity only just suddenly find myself unable to resist a 10-minute explanation of the nuances of trade policy or the pace of Arctic melting
BKOB-1916||what do you think I say pleased with my thermoses I walked off stage
BKOB-1917||you got me on the quiz ask would reply no votes.
BKOB-1918||these were issues I could text with time a greater concern as we rolled into the spring was the fact that I was grumpy
BKOB-1919||one reason for that I realize now was the total of a two-year Senate campaign a year of Townhouses to Senator and months of travel on behalf of other candidates
BKOB-1920||once the adrenaline of the announcement where I miss your magnitude
BKOB-1921||the grind now before me struck with full force
BKOB-1922||and it was a grind we're not in Washington for Senate business I soon found myself in Iowa or one of the other early States putting in sixteen-hour days 6 1/2 days a week
BKOB-1923||breaking in a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn or American or a Super 8
BKOB-1924||I'm wake up after 5 or 6 hours and try to squeeze in a work out of whatever facility we could find
BKOB-1925||the old treadmill in the back of a tanning salon with memorable
BKOB-1926||for packing up my clothes and gulping down a haphazard breakfast before hopping into a van and making fundraising calls on the way to the first town hall meeting of the day
BKOB-1927||before interviews with local paper or New Station
BKOB-1928||several meet-and-greets with local party leaders the bathroom stop and maybe a swing by a local eatery to shake hands before hopping back in the van to Balfour more dollars
BKOB-1929||arepitas for three or four times with a cold sandwich with salad when dinner
BKOB-1930||somewhere before finally staggering into another motel around 9 p.m. trying to catch Michelle in the girls by phone before they went to bed before reading the next day's briefing materials to binder gradually slipping out of my hands is exhausting knock me out
BKOB-1931||and that's not even counting the flights to New York or LA or Chicago or Dallas for fundraisers
BKOB-1932||it was a wife not of Glamour but monotony and the prospect of 18 continuous months of it quickly wore down my spirit
BKOB-1933||I'd stake my claim in the presidential race involved a big team of people beg strangers for money and propagated a vision I believe them
BKOB-1934||I miss my wife I miss my kids I miss my bed I can put the shower sitting at a proper table for a proper meal
BKOB-1935||I miss not having to say the exact same thing the exact same way five or six or seven times a day
BKOB-1936||fortunately along with Gibbs who had the Constitution experience in general orneriness
BKOB-1937||keep me Focus while on the road I had two other companions to help me push through my initial funk
BKOB-1938||first with Marvin Nicholson a half Canadian with an easy charm and unflappable to me
BKOB-1939||his mid-thirties and a towering 6 ft 8
BKOB-1940||Marvin had held a variety of jobs from golf caddy to bartender at a strip club before landing work is John Kerry's body man for years early
BKOB-1941||it's a strange roll the bodyman the personal assistant in jack-of-all-trades responsible for making sure that the candidate has everything he or she needs to function
BKOB-1942||what are favorite snack or a couple Advil an umbrella when it's wet or scarf when it's cold or the name of the county chairman who's driving your way for a handshake
BKOB-1943||Marvin operated with such skill and finesse he become something of a cult figure in political circles which should let us to hire Emma's our trip director working with the listen the advanced team to coordinate travel make sure I have Pro print materials and keep me at least close to on sketch
BKOB-1945||raise the North Carolina to southern middle class white parents 6ft 4in powerfully-built
BKOB-1946||registered in both basketball and football at Duke University before he plows hired him as an assistant in my Senate Office
BKOB-1947||people often expressed surprise and how tall I am a bit over 6 ft 1 something I tribute in part 2 years of being dwarfed By Reggie and Marvin and photograph
BKOB-1948||under Marvin's tutelage twenty-five-year-old Reggie took over his body man and though he had a rough go of it at first somehow managing to forget my briefcase in Miami and my suit jacket in New Hampshire during the same week
BKOB-1949||it's serious work ethic and Goofy Good Humor quickly made him a favorite of everyone on the campaign
BKOB-1950||for the better part of two years Gibbs Marvin and Reggie would be my caretakers my anchors to normalcy
BKOB-1951||and a steady source of comic relief we played cards and shot pool
BKOB-1952||we are about sports and swap music
BKOB-1953||Reggie help me update a hip-hop playlist and stop the Public Enemy
BKOB-1954||Marvin Reggie told me about their socialize on-the-road complicated and their adventures in various local stops after I work with them tattoo parlors and hot tubs were sometimes feature
BKOB-1955||which is Reggie about his youthful ignorance once when I mentioned Paul Newman Reggie said that's the salad dressing guy right
BKOB-1956||and gives about his appetites about Iowa State Fair gives would have trouble choosing between the deep-fried Twinkie and the deep fried Snickers bar until the woman behind the counter help way said honey you have to choose
BKOB-1957||anytime we could we played basketball even the smallest town had a high school gym and if there wasn't time for proper game Reggie and I would still roll up our sleeves and get in around of course while waiting for me to go on stage
BKOB-1958||like any true athlete he remain fiercely competitive
BKOB-1959||I sometimes woke up today after I get payment one-on-one barely able to walk. Too Proud to let my discomfort show
BKOB-1960||once we play the group of New Hampshire firefighters from whom I was trying to secure an endorsement
BKOB-1961||a standard Weekend Warriors a bit younger than me but in worse shape
BKOB-1962||after the first three times Reggie stole the ball down the floor and went in for thunderous dunks I called the timer
BKOB-1963||what you doing
BKOB-1964||you understand that I'm trying to get their support right but you looked at me in disbelief
BKOB-1965||you want to lose to be stressed I thought for a second
BKOB-1966||I said don't go that far just keep it close enough that they're not too pissed
BKOB-1967||spending time with Reggie Marvin and Gibbs I found respite from the pressures of the campaign
BKOB-1968||small sphere why wasn't a candidate or a symbol or a generational boys bring the boss
BKOB-1969||rather just one of the guys which is I slogged through those early months felt more valuable than a pep talk
BKOB-1970||give the try to go to pep talk route with me at one point as we were boarding another airplane at the end of another interminable day after a particularly flat appearance
BKOB-1971||he told me that I need to smile more to remember that it was a great adventure now that Motors loved a happy warrior
BKOB-1972||are you having any fun here no I said
BKOB-1973||anything we can do to make this more fun no
BKOB-1974||sitting in the seat in front of us ready overheard the conversation and turned back to look at me with a wide grin
BKOB-1975||is any consolation he said I'm having the time of my life
BKOB-1976||it was about him tell him that at the time
BKOB-1978||looking back I realize I was doing what most of us tend to do when we're uncertain or flapper
BKOB-1979||we reach for what feels familiar but we think we're good at
BKOB-1980||I know policy I know how to consume and process information
BKOB-1981||took awhile to figure out that my problem wasn't a lack of a 10-point plan
BKOB-1982||rather was my general inability to boil issues down to their Essence to tell a story that helps explain an increasingly uncertain world to the American people and make them feel that I the president could help them navigate
BKOB-1983||my more seasoned opponents are the understood this
BKOB-1984||embarrass myself early and their presents at Healthcare Forum sponsored by the service employees International Union held in Las Vegas on a Saturday evening late in March
BKOB-1985||Prophet was it that my participation in his views but Cattle Calls were candidates appeared before this or that Democratic interest group fights are the strengths of insiders and took time away from direct voter contact
BKOB-1986||I just agreed help there was an issue I felt strongly about
BKOB-1987||I don't because I've heard many devastating personal stories while campaigning
BKOB-1988||because I never forget my mother in her waning days friend not just about her chances of survival but about whether her insurance would keep us solvent during treatment
BKOB-1989||as it turned out I should have listened to my head was planned with too many facts into few answers
BKOB-1990||before a large audience of healthcare workers I stumbled mumbled Hamden hard on stage
BKOB-1991||under party questioning I had to confess that I didn't yet have a definitive plan for delivering affordable healthcare
BKOB-1992||you could hear crickets in the auditorium the Associated Press read a story for teaching my showing up before 1 that would probably get picked up by Outlets across the country under the painful headline
BKOB-1993||is Obama all style and little substance
BKOB-1994||my performance stood in sharp contrast to those of John Edwards and Hillary Clinton the two
BKOB-1995||contenders Edwards the handsome and Polished former vice presidential candidate for Senate in 2004 to be John Kerry's running mate then maybe Show starting a poverty Center but never really stopped campaigning full time for Fresno
BKOB-1996||well I've never been particularly impressed with that words
BKOB-1997||despite the fact that he had working-class Roots his newly-minted populism sounded synthetic than poll-tested to me the political equivalent of one of those boy bands dreamed up by a studio marketing
BKOB-1998||then Las Vegas I was chasing cuz I watched him layout of Chris proposal for Universal coverage displaying all the gifts for the made a mistake septal trial lawyer back in North Carolina
BKOB-1999||Hillary was even better like many people have spent the 1990s observing the cleanse from afar
BKOB-2000||I'd admired bills prodigious talents and intellectual Firepower
BKOB-2001||if I wasn't always comfortable with the specifics of the so-called triangulations signing welfare reform legislation
BKOB-2002||medical protections for those who couldn't find jobs the tough-on-crime rhetoric that would contribute to an explosion in the federal prison population
BKOB-2003||I appreciated the skill with which she has steered Progressive policymaking and the Democratic party back toward electability
BKOB-2004||as for the former first lady I found her just as impressive and more sympathetic
BKOB-2005||maybe it was because of Hillary story I saw traces what my mother and grandmother had gone through
BKOB-2006||all of them smart ambitious women put chased under the constraints of their times having to navigate male Egos and social expectations
BKOB-2007||if Hillary becomes Garden perhaps overly scripted who could blame her give me a taxi been subjected to
BKOB-2008||in the Senate my favorable opinion of her had been largely confirm
BKOB-2009||in all our interactions became crosses hardworking personable and always impeccably compare
BKOB-2010||Chelsea had a good hearty laugh that tended to lighten the mood of everyone around
BKOB-2011||but I decided to run despite Hillary presence in the race had less to do with any assessment of her personal shortcomings and more to do with my feeling that she just couldn't escape the rancor grudges and hardness substance arising out of the Clinton White House years
BKOB-2012||I didn't see how she could close American political divide or change how Washington did business or provide the country with the fresh started need
BKOB-2013||speak passionately and knowledgeable about Healthcare on stage that evening at the SEIU forum
BKOB-2014||entering the cloud sheer enthusiasm tickly after she was done
BKOB-2015||I wondered if I miscalculated that form would hardly be the last time Hillary or for that matter half the primary field outperform me
BKOB-2016||resume standards we were gathered for debate once every two or three weeks
BKOB-2017||I've never been particularly good in these format myself
BKOB-2018||my long wind up some preference for complicated answers works against me to take away on stage with 7
BKOB-2019||Hobby proz in a single time minute a question
BKOB-2020||during the first debate in April the operator called time at least twice before I was done steak
BKOB-2021||ask about how I'd handle multiple Terrace to text I just got the need to coordinate federal help but neglected to mention the obvious imperative to go after the perpetrators
BKOB-2022||for the next several minutes Hillary and the others took turns pointing out my oversight
BKOB-2023||their tongues were stopper for The Gleam in their eyes said take that rookie
BKOB-2024||afterwards ask with General in his postgame critique
BKOB-2025||your problem he said if you keep trying to answer the question
BKOB-2026||it's not the point I said no Baroque accept that is not the point
BKOB-2027||the point is to get your message across what are your values what are your priorities
BKOB-2028||that's what people care about half the time the moderators just using the question to try to trip you up
BKOB-2029||your job is to avoid the traffic
BKOB-2030||take whatever question they give you give them online to make it seem like you answered it and then talk about what you want to talk about
BKOB-2031||that's bulshit I said exactly he said
BKOB-2032||I was frustrated with accent even more frustrated with myself
BKOB-2033||but I realized his Insight was hard to deny after watching a replay of the debate
BKOB-2034||the most effective debate answers it seemed weird design not that illuminate
BKOB-2035||to evoke an emotion or identify the enemy or signal to a constituency that you more than anyone else on that stage where and would always be on their side
BKOB-2036||it was easy to dismiss the exercise of superficial

BKOB-2071||it was about building a better country I'd tell them not about egos or presti
BKOB-2072||I would listen to their take on an issue especially if they had some expertise but I wouldn't shave my positions to satisfy them

BKOB-2083||this is not all up to you though donations told us

BKOB-2105||more than that beneath the Tactical insights detailed District voting histories and political anecdotes you might hear if you listen carefully enough the heart of the 10-year old boy who cared enough who believed enough to cry over an election
BKOB-2106||anyone who's ever run for president will likely tell you that there's nothing simple about winning Iowa
BKOB-2107||it's one of the number of u.s. states that holds a caucus to determine which
BKOB-2109||but participatory democracy had much to commend
BKOB-2110||but it was time consuming I caught this could last 3 hours or more
BKOB-2111||and require participants to be well-informed willing to mow publicly and committed enough to make an evening of
BKOB-2112||unsurprisingly caucuses 1:50 attractive small and static cross-section of the Iowa lecture
BKOB-2113||made up of older voters party functionaries longtime partisans
BKOB-2114||those who shoot in general to the tried-and-true this meant the Democratic caucus scores were more likely to support a known quantity like Hillary Clint
BKOB-2115||when someone like me from the start to impress upon plus and flop and turn impressed upon me that if we want to win Iowa we needed to run a different kind of campaign
BKOB-2116||we have to work harder and longer face-to-face twin over traditional caucus-goers
BKOB-2117||more importantly we have to convince a whole lot of likely Obama supporters young people people of color and Penance to overcome the various hurdles and Hang-Ups and participate in the caucus for the very first time
BKOB-2118||to do it to them fitted on opening office right away covering all 99 Iowa counties and for each office we'd hire young staffer who with little pee or day-to-day supervision would be responsible for engineering their own local political move
BKOB-2119||it was a big investment and an early gamble but we gave to the Greenlight
BKOB-2120||you went to work with an outstanding team of deputies who helped develop his plan
BKOB-2121||which store has galston and philippic and Emily Parcell
BKOB-2122||all of them smart discipline experience on multiple campaigns and under 32 years old
BKOB-2123||I spent the most time with Emily was nine when they doesn't work for former Governor Tom vilsack
BKOB-2124||to figured she'd be especially helpful to me is I navigated local politics
BKOB-2125||you're twenty-six one of the youngest in the group the dark hair and sensible clothes and diminutive enough to pass for high school senior
BKOB-2126||I quickly discovered she knew just about every Democrat in the state and had no qualms about giving me very specific instructions at every stop covering whom I should talk to and which issues the local community most cared about
BKOB-2127||this information was delivered in a deadpan monotone along with a look that suggested a low tolerance for foolishness equality Emily may have inherited from her mom
BKOB-2128||worked at the Motorola plant for three decades and still managed to put herself through college
BKOB-2129||during the long hours we've been traveling between events in a rented campaign van I made it my mission to coax a smile out of Emily

BKOB-2151||lastly he stressed the importance of encouraging voters to get involved instead of just selling them a candidate like a box of laundry
BKOB-2152||anyone breach these values got scolded and sometimes pulled from the field
BKOB-2153||when during our teams weekly conference call a new organizer made a joke about why he joined the campaign saying something about
BKOB-2154||hating Panthers a reference to Hillary's favorite campaign attire
BKOB-2155||admonished him in a lengthy rant for all the other organizers to here
BKOB-2156||it's not what we stand for he said not even in private
BKOB-2157||Vista heart because to practice what you preach
BKOB-2158||despite the occasional intemperate Outburst he never fail to show people how much they matter
BKOB-2159||Mary Grace's uncle died Tuesday Claire National Mary Grace Bay

BKOB-2164||all told I would spend 87 days and I would idea
BKOB-2165||example each towns culinary specialty shoot hoops with school kids on any Court we could find an experience every possible whether event from funnel cloud to sideways sleep
BKOB-2166||those young men and women working Amazon hours for subsistence wages or my able guide
BKOB-2167||most were barely out of college many were on their first campaign in far away from home
BKOB-2168||I'm a grown up in Iowa or the role Midwest know you're with the attitudes and way of life of mid-sized towns like Sioux City or Altoona
BKOB-2169||that wasn't typical assemble our organizers in a room and you'd find Italians from Philly Jews from Chicago Black from New York and Asian from California and Children Of The Rich suburbs
BKOB-2170||engineering Majors former Peace Corps volunteers military veterans and high school dropouts
BKOB-2171||on the surface at least there's no way to connect their wildly varied experiences to the meeting potatoes folks who votes we desperately need
BKOB-2172||and yet they did collect arriving in town with a duffel bag or a small suitcase
BKOB-2173||living in the spare bedroom or basement of some early local supporter they would spend months getting to know a place
BKOB-2174||visiting Waka Barbershop setting up card tables in from the grocery store speaking at The Rotary Club
BKOB-2175||they helped coach little league assisted local charities and called her mom for a banana pudding recipe so they wouldn't show up at the potluck empty hand
BKOB-2176||they learn to listen to their local volunteer most of them were much older with their own jobs families and concerns
BKOB-2177||I got good at recruiting new ones too they worked each day to exhaustion and fought off bouts of loneliness and fear
BKOB-2178||month by month A1 people's trust
BKOB-2179||they were no longer strangers what a tonic seizure
BKOB-2180||kids and I were were they filled me with optimism and gratitude and a sense of coming full circle
BKOB-2181||and then I saw myself 25 arriving in Chicago confused and idealistic
BKOB-2182||I remember the precious bonds I've made with families on the Southside
BKOB-2183||mistakes in small victories the community I have found similar to what our field organizers were now forging for themselves
BKOB-2184||experiences pointed me back why I've gone into government in the first place
BKOB-2185||toward the Taproot idea that maybe politics could be less about power and positioning and more about community and connection
BKOB-2186||our volunteers across Iowa might believe in me I thought to myself
BKOB-2187||they were working as hard as they were mainly because of those young organizers
BKOB-2188||just as those kids may have signed up to work for the campaign because of something I've said or done but now they belong to the volunteer
BKOB-2189||what drove them what's the sting them independent of
BKOB-2190||candidate for a particular issue for the friendships and relationships the mutual loyalty in progress born of joint effort
BKOB-2191||that Heather cantankerous boss back in the morning the one who is promising to shave his eyebrows if they succeed
BKOB-2192||by June our campaign to turn the corner thanks the skyrocketing internet donations our financial performance continue to far outstrip our projections allowing us to go up early on Iowa TV
BKOB-2193||school out for the summer Michelle my girls were able to join me more off and on the road
BKOB-2194||rumbling across Iowa in an RV the sound of their chatter in the background as I make calls thing Reggie and Marvin take on Malia and Sasha and Marathon games of Uno
BKOB-2195||feeling the general weight of one daughter are another sleeping against me on an afternoon delight
BKOB-2196||and always be obligatory ice cream stops all of it filled me with a joy that carried over into my public appearances
BKOB-2197||the nature of those appearances changed as well
BKOB-2198||the initial novelty of my candidacy wore off I found myself speaking the more manageable crowd a few hundred rather than thousands
BKOB-2199||just gave me the chance once again to meet people one-on-one and listen to their stories
BKOB-2200||military spouses describe the day-to-day struggles of running a household and fighting off the terror possibly hearing bad news from the front
BKOB-2201||Farmers explain the pressures that led them to surrender their independence to Big agribusiness concerns
BKOB-2202||laid off workers talk me through the Myriad ways that existing job training programs that failed
BKOB-2203||small business owners detail the sacrifices they've made to pay for their employees health insurance until just one employee fell sick and everyone premium became unaffordable including their own
BKOB-2204||inform Bybee stories by stump speech became less abstract of matter of the head and more matter of the heart
BKOB-2205||people heard their own wife reflected in these stories learning that they were not alone in their hearts
BKOB-2206||but that knowledge or more of them signed up to volunteer on my behalf
BKOB-2207||campaigning on this more retail humanscale also offer the opportunity for chance encounters that made the campaign come alive
BKOB-2208||that's what happened when I visit Greenwood South Carolina one day in June
BKOB-2209||the most of my time was spent in Iowa I was also paying regular visits to other states like New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina primaries and caucuses would follow in quick succession
BKOB-2210||the trip to Greenwood was the result of a rash promise I made to an influential legislator who'd offered endorse me but only if I visited her hometown
BKOB-2211||it turned out my brother was poorly time coming during an especially rough week amid bad poll numbers that stories in the papers bad moods and bad sleep
BKOB-2212||it didn't help the Greenwood was more than an hour from the nearest major airport
BKOB-2213||we're driving through torrential rain and when I finally arrived at the municipal building where the event was supposed to be held I found only
BKOB-2214||people are so gathered inside all of them as damp as I was from the store
BKOB-2215||a wasted day I thought to myself mentally taking off all the other work I could have been doing
BKOB-2216||I'm going through the motions shaking hands after you people what they did for a living quietly trying to calculate how fast I could get out of there
BKOB-2217||when suddenly I heard a piercing voice shout out
BKOB-2218||my staff and I were startled thinking maybe it was a heckler
BKOB-2219||without missing a beat the rest of the room responded in unison
BKOB-2220||ready to go again the same boys shouted once again the group was spotted ready to go
BKOB-2221||I'm sure what was happening I turned to look behind me my is landing on the source of the commotion
BKOB-2222||a middle-aged black woman dressed like she had just come from church with a colorful dress a big hat
BKOB-2223||and an ear-to-ear grin that included The Shining gold tooth
BKOB-2224||her name was Edith child's in addition to serving on the Greenwood County Council
BKOB-2225||the local NAACP chapter while also being a professional private eye
BKOB-2226||it turned out she was well-known for this particular call-and-response
BKOB-2227||she started it at Greenwoods football game 4th of July parades Community meetings or whenever the spirit have in the movie
BKOB-2228||the next few minutes either fled the room and holler fired up ready to go back and forth again and again
BKOB-2229||I was confused at first but figured it would be impolite for me not to join it
BKOB-2230||and pretty soon I start feeling kind of fired up
BKOB-2231||start to feel like I was ready to go and knows everybody at the meeting suddenly was smiling too and after the chanting was done we settled down and talk for the next hour by the community in the country and what we could do to make it better
BKOB-2232||even after I left for the rest of the day every so often someone on my staff and ask you fired up
BKOB-2233||eventually became a campaign rally cry and then I suppose was the
BKOB-2234||politics it would always give me the most pleasure
BKOB-2235||the part that couldn't be diagram the defied planning or Analytics
BKOB-2236||the way in which went Works a campaign and by extension a democracy
BKOB-2237||prove to be a course rather than a solo act
BKOB-2238||another lesson I learned from boaters they weren't interested in hearing me parrot conventional wisdom
BKOB-2239||during the first few months of campaigning I worried at least subconsciously about what Washington opinion-makers.
BKOB-2240||in the interest of being deemed sufficiently quote serious or presidential
BKOB-2241||I become stiff and self-conscious undermining the very rationale that it led me to run in the first place
BKOB-2242||but by the summer we went back to First principles and actively look for opportunities to challenge the Washington Playbook until hard truth
BKOB-2243||for teachers union Gathering not only for higher salaries and more flexibility in
BKOB-2244||but also for greater accountability
BKOB-2245||that last bit was being a deafening silence and then a smattering of Boos in the hall
BKOB-2246||at the Detroit economic Club I told Auto executive but at present I would push hard for higher fuel economy standards
BKOB-2247||opposition ardently opposed by The Big Three automakers
BKOB-2248||what group called Iowa for sensible priorities sponsored by Ben & Jerry of ice cream thing gather 10,000 signatures from people committing to caucus for a candidate who promised to cut the pentagon's defense budget
BKOB-2249||call either Ben or Jerry I don't remember which to say that although I agreed with the objective and very much wanted their support I couldn't have president be hamstrung by any pledge I've made when it came to our national security
BKOB-2250||the group eventually opted to endorse John Edwards I was starting to look different from my Democratic rivals in more ways than the obvious
BKOB-2251||bait in Late July I was shown images of feet
BKOB-2252||Castro Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad North Korean leader Kim Jong and a couple of other desk and asked if I'd be prepared to meet with any of them during my first year in office
BKOB-2253||what are the station I said yeah I'd meet with any world leader if I thought it could Advance you essentra
BKOB-2254||well you would have thought I had said the world was flat
BKOB-2255||on the debate was over at words and a bunch of the other candidate pants accusing me of being naive and trusting that I'm meeting with the American president with a privilege to be on
BKOB-2256||the Press Corps in large part seemed to agree perhaps even a few months earlier I might have gotten wobbly second-guessing my choice of words and issuing a clarifying statement afterwards
BKOB-2257||but I might like believe me now and I was convinced I was right but technically on the more General principle that America shouldn't be afraid to engage its adversaries are pushed for diplomatic solutions to conflicts
BKOB-2258||as far as I was concerned it was this disregard for diplomacy that it let Hillary in the rest that's mentioned the mainstream press to follow George W bush into war
BKOB-2259||another foreign policy argument arose just a few days later when during a speech I mentioned that if I had Osama Bin Laden in my sights within Pakistani territory and the Pakistani government was unwilling or unable to catch or kill him I would take the shot
BKOB-2260||it should've been particularly surprising anyone back in 2003 I promised my opposition to the Iraq War partly on my belief that would distract us from destroying Al-Qaeda
BKOB-2261||such blunt talk ran counter to the bush administration's public position
BKOB-2262||u.s. government maintain the door fiction that Pakistan was a reliable partner in the war against terrorism and that we never encroached on Pakistani territory in the pursuit of terrorists
BKOB-2263||my statement through Washington into a bipartisan Tippy for Joe Biden the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican presidential candidate John McCain
BKOB-2264||expressing The View that I was not ready to be present
BKOB-2265||in my mind these episodes indicated the degree to which the Washington foreign policy establishment got things back
BKOB-2266||taking military action without first testing diplomatic options observing diplomatic niceties in the interest of maintaining the status quo precisely what action was called for
BKOB-2267||it also indicated the degree to which decision-makers in Washington consistently failed to level with the American people
BKOB-2268||I would never fully convinced the national pundits that I was right on these arguments
BKOB-2269||Define trend begin to show up in the polls after each of these Desta
BKOB-2270||Democratic primary voters agreed with me
BKOB-2271||having such substance of arguments felt liberated a reminder of why I was right
BKOB-2272||they helped me regain my voice is a candidate that confidence showed a few debates later had an early-morning affair at Drake University in Iowa
BKOB-2273||the moderator George Stephanopoulos with ABC quickly gave Joe Biden
BKOB-2274||explain why exactly I was not ready to be present
BKOB-2275||by the time I got my opportunity to respond five minutes later I had to listen to practically every other candidate onstage knocked me around
BKOB-2276||well you know what to prepare for this debate I wrote him a bumper cars at the state fair I said using a line acid come up with referencing my well-publicized Excursion with Malia and Sasha to the state fair earlier that week
BKOB-2277||the audience laughed and for the next hour I happily jousted with my opponents suggesting that any Democratic voter was trying to figure out who represent a real change from the failed policies of George Bush need look no further than the respective positions of those of us on stage
BKOB-2278||the first time since the debates have begun I enjoyed myself
BKOB-2279||that morning was that I had one
BKOB-2280||it was gratifying result if for no other reason to not having to endure any dour looks from the team
BKOB-2281||you killed it except slapping me on the back
BKOB-2282||I guess we'll be pushing to have all the Base today in the morning
BKOB-2283||pop joke that's not funny
BKOB-2284||I was not and am not a morning person
BKOB-2285||we piled into the car and start driving tour next stop
BKOB-2286||along the Route or supporters several rows deep could be heard shouting long after they disappeared from sight
BKOB-2288||part of the reason I received so much attention from the moderators during the Drake University debate was the release of an ABC poll showing me leading in Iowa for the first time I'll be at by just 1 percent over both Glen Edwards
BKOB-2289||race was close clearly later poles would put me right back in third place but there was no denying that our Iowa organization was having an impact especially among younger voters
BKOB-2290||you could feel it in the crowds in their spies their energy and most important the number supporter cards and volunteer sign-ups were collecting at every stop
BKOB-2291||we must have six months to go before the caucus or strength was only built
BKOB-2292||unfortunately none of our progress showed up a national poll
BKOB-2293||are focused on Iowa and extent New Hampshire met we made minimal TV buys an appearance is elsewhere and by September we remained around 20 points behind Hillary
BKOB-2294||what is best to educate prices to why National polls were meaningless of this early stage but to no avail
BKOB-2295||increasingly I find myself feeling anxious phone calls from supporters around the country many offering policy advice advertising suggestion complaints that we've neglected this or that interest group and general questions about our confidence
BKOB-2296||two things finally flipped a narrative the first one not of our making
BKOB-2297||at a late October debate in Philadelphia Hillary whose performances until then had been nearly Flawless got tangled up unwilling to provide a straight answer on the issue of whether undocumented workers should be allowed driver's licenses
BKOB-2298||I got at least you've been coached to Hatcher respond since it was an issue that divided the Democratic base
BKOB-2299||reference to straddle the fence only fed the already prevalent impression that she was a garden-variety Washington politician
BKOB-2300||sharpening the contrast we've been hoping to make and then there was what happened at the Iowa Jefferson Jackson dinner on November 10th which was of our making
BKOB-2301||traditionally vajayjay better signal the final Sprint Secaucus Bay and offer the kind of barometric reading of where the race stood with each candidate delivering a ten minute speech without notes before an arena of 8,000 potential caucus doors as well as the national media
BKOB-2302||I thought you was a key Pastor both our messages appeal and our organizational promise going into the final few weeks
BKOB-2303||we put everything we had into a successful showing plenty of boxes to bring and supporters from all 99 counties across the state and dwarfing turnout from the other campaign

BKOB-2308||I do trust Pass Oregon from axon plus the producer draft effectively summarize my case for the nomination
BKOB-2309||and fans delivered in that critical moment of our campaign with only modest input for me
BKOB-2310||this guy just a few years out of college had produced a great speech
BKOB-2311||Wanda did more than show the distinction between me and my right between Democrats and Republicans
BKOB-2312||outline the challenges we faced as a nation
BKOB-2313||from war to climate change to the affordability of healthcare and the need for new and clear leadership
BKOB-2314||noting that the party had historically been strongest wood leaders who led not by-polls but my principal
BKOB-2315||bye-bye calculation but by conviction
BKOB-2316||it was true the moment true my aspirations for getting into politics and true I hoped to the aspirations of the country
BKOB-2317||I memorize the speech over several late nights after we were done campaigning
BKOB-2318||and by the time I finish delivering it as luck would have it the last candidate to speak
BKOB-2319||I was as certain of its effect as I've been after my breast to the Democratic National Convention three-and-a-half years earlier
BKOB-2320||Looking Back the Night of the j.j. dinner was when I became convinced we would win Iowa
BKOB-2321||and by extension the nomination not necessarily because I was most polished candidate but because we have the right message for the time and headed tracted young people would forget just how
BKOB-2322||control themselves behind the cost
BKOB-2323||I think we won Iowa tonight match would organize the entire evening and was generally a basket of nerves he suffered from insomnia shingles and hair loss through much of the campaign
BKOB-2324||ran to the bathroom to throw up for at least the second time that day
BKOB-2325||Emily was similarly bullish although you couldn't tell
BKOB-2326||after I was finished an ecstatic Bowery ran into Emily and asked what she thought
BKOB-2327||there's great Emily said you don't look very excited
BKOB-2328||this is my excited face McLendon campaign apparently felt the shifting time
BKOB-2329||not to that point Hillary and her team had largely avoided engaging our campaign directly content to stay above The Fray and nurse their sizable lead in National polls
BKOB-2330||but over the next several weeks they changed tack deciding to go after us hard
BKOB-2331||is mostly standard-issue stuff raising questions about my lack of experience and ability
BKOB-2332||check on Republicans in Washington unfortunately for them though the two lines of attack that attracted the most attention backfired badly
BKOB-2333||the first grew out of a standard line in my stump speech in which I said I was running for president not because was owed to me or because I want to be present on my life because the times called for something new
BKOB-2334||well the Queen Camp issued a memo fighting a press clip in which one of my teachers in indonesi Plan diet written essay in kindergarten about wanting to be present
BKOB-2335||prove it seemed that my perfect idealism was merely a disguise for a ruthless ambition
BKOB-2336||I heard about this I laughed like the idea anyone outside my family remembered anything I said or did almost fourty years earlier was a bit far-fetched
BKOB-2337||not mentioned this coffee is squaring my apparent useful plan for world domination with middling High School grades and drug consumption obscure stent as a community organizer and associations with all time
BKOB-2339||but in December 2007 at least the clintons opposition Research into what I called my kindergarten files was viewed as a sign of panic and widely pan
BKOB-2340||what's the music was interviewing which Billy Shaheen the co-chair of Clinton campaign in New Hampshire suggested to a reporter that myself is closed prior drug use would prove fatal in a matchup against the Republican nominee
BKOB-2341||I didn't consider the general question of my youthful indiscretions out-of-bounds it Shaheem when a bit further and find perhaps I dealt drugs as well
BKOB-2342||the interview stuff up here in Shaheen quickly resign from his post
BKOB-2343||all this happened just ahead of her final debate in Iowa
BKOB-2344||that morning motelr and I were in Washington for a senate
BKOB-2345||my team and I got to the airport for the flight to Des Moines Hillary Charter plane turned out to be parked right next door
BKOB-2346||for takeoff abedini Hillary's aide found Reggie and let him know that the senator was hoping to speak to me
BKOB-2347||I'm at Hillary on the tarmac Reggie and Uma hovering a few Paces away
BKOB-2348||Hillary apologize for Shaheem I thanked her and then suggested we both do a better job of raining in our surrogate
BKOB-2349||epistolary got agitated for boys sharpening as she claimed that my team was routinely engaging in unfair attacks Distortion and underhanded tactics
BKOB-2350||exploring the temperature were unsuccessful and the conversation ended abruptly with her still visibly angry as she boarded her plane
BKOB-2351||on the flight to Des Moines I try to appreciate the frustrations Hillary must have been feeling
BKOB-2352||a woman of enormous intelligent she had toiled sacrificed indoor public attacks and humiliations all in service of her husband's career but also raising a wonderful daughter

BKOB-2355||checking every box when he most debates raising scads of money
BKOB-2356||and now to find yourself suddenly in a close contest with a man 14 years younger
BKOB-2357||handpay the same dudes didn't carry the same Battle Stars and who seem to be getting every break and every benefit of the doubt
BKOB-2358||honestly who wouldn't be aggravated moreover Hillary wasn't entirely wrong about my team's willingness to give as good as a guy
BKOB-2359||compared to other modern presidential campaign we really were different consistently upsizing a positive message highlighting what I was for rather than what I was against
BKOB-2360||I believe starts phone from top to bottom
BKOB-2361||more than once I kill TV spots I felt were unfair or too far
BKOB-2362||film sometimes we fell short of our high-minded rhetoric
BKOB-2363||in fact the angriest I ever got during the campaign involves a leaked memo drafted by a research team back in June criticizing Hillary Outsourcing of jobs to India
BKOB-2364||and with the snarky title quote Hillary Clinton D Punjab
BKOB-2365||MyTeam insisted the memo was never meant for public consumption but I did not care
BKOB-2366||it's shoddy argument and nativist own had me ripshit 4 days
BKOB-2367||in the end I don't think it was any specific action on our part that caused the dust-up with Hillary on the tarmac
BKOB-2368||rather was the general fact of my challenge the intensifying heat of our rivalry
BKOB-2369||six other candidates still in the race for the poles were beginning to clarify where we were headed
BKOB-2370||killer in me battling each other until the end
BKOB-2371||it was a dynamic we'd live with day and night weekends and holidays for many months to come
BKOB-2372||team spanking us like miniature Army eats Stafford fully indoctrinated Into the Fire
BKOB-2373||it was part of the brutal nature of modern politics I was discovered
BKOB-2374||the difficulty of competing in a game where there were no clearly defined rules a game in which your opponents are not merely trying to put a ball through a basket or push it across the goal line
BKOB-2375||but are instead trying to convince the broad public at least implicitly more often explicitly that it matters of judgment intelligence values and character
BKOB-2376||they are more worthy than you you might tell yourself it's not person
BKOB-2377||but that's not how it feels not to you and certainly not to your family your staff for your supporters
BKOB-2378||caterpillar every slight and it reinstalled real or perceived
BKOB-2379||the longer the campaign goes on the tide of the contest the higher the stakes the easier it is to justify
BKOB-2380||Hardball tactics until those basic human responses that normally Governor daily life honesty empathy courtesy patients Goodwill
BKOB-2381||feel like weakness when extended to the other side
BKOB-2382||I can't say all this was on my mind by the time I walked into the debate the evening after the tarmac exit
BKOB-2383||mostly I read Hillary their attention as a sign that we are pulling head that the momentum was truly are
BKOB-2384||during the debate the moderator asked why if I was still insisting on the need for change in America approach to foreign policy that I have so many former Clinton administration officials advising
BKOB-2385||I want to hear that resetting the microphone
BKOB-2386||ipaws letting the truck has died down well Hillary I'm looking forward to you advising me as well
BKOB-2387||it was a good night for the team with a month left before the caucuses Demoine register poll now showed me with a three-point lead over Hillary
BKOB-2388||Sprint was full-on with candidates from both parties dashing around the state in the final weeks trying to win over any uncommitted voter to find and motivate In Pockets of people who might not otherwise turn out on the appointed night
BKOB-2390||John Edwards meanwhile was attempting to cover similar to rain in a bus
BKOB-2392||he's gathering for electric pulling in the car

BKOB-2395||in the Endo wasn't the poles for the size of the rallies are the celebrities who flew in that I remember most
BKOB-2396||instead it was howling those last days the whole campaign took on the feeling of family
BKOB-2397||Michelle's openness and Candor and proved to be an ass that she was a natural on the stump
BKOB-2398||the Iowa team came to call her the closer because of how many people signed up once they heard her speak
BKOB-2399||are siblings and closest friends all came to Iowa Craig from Chicago and Mayer from Hawaii and Alma from Kenya the nesbitts the Whitakers Valerie and all their kids not to mention Michelle passel of Aunts Uncles and cousins
BKOB-2400||my childhood friend from Hawaii bodies for my organizing days Law School
BKOB-2401||former State Senate colleagues and many of our donors came arriving in groups like big traveling reunions often without me even knowing they were there
BKOB-2403||it was more than just blood relatives or people we've known for years
BKOB-2404||the people of Iowa spend so much time with felt like family to
BKOB-2405||the local party leaders like attorney general Tom Miller and Treasurer Mike Fitzgerald but taking a flyer on me when few would give me a shot
BKOB-2406||volunteers like Gary lamb a progressive farmer from Tama County who helped us with rural Outreach
BKOB-2407||Leo Peck who at eighty-two have knocked on more doors than just about anybody
BKOB-2408||Mari Ortiz an African-American nurse married to a Hispanic man
BKOB-2409||in a mostly White Town came into the office to make calls three or four times a week sometimes cooking dinner for organizer there because she thought he was too skinny
BKOB-2410||family and then of course there were the field organizer
BKOB-2411||as busy as they were we decided to have them invite their parents to the Jay Jenner and the next day we host the reception for
BKOB-2412||just so that Michelle and I could say thank you to each other and to their parents for having produced such amazing sons and daughters
BKOB-2413||to this day there's nothing I wouldn't do for those kids
BKOB-2414||on the big night plotting Valerie decide to join me Reggie and Marvin on a surprise visit to a high school in Ankeny a suburb of Des Moines were several precincts would be holding their caucuses
BKOB-2415||it was January 3rd just after 6 p.m. less than an hour before the caucuses were scheduled to begin and yet the place was already packed
BKOB-2416||people's screen towards the main building from every direction and noisy
BKOB-2417||pull up Humanity no age race class or body type appeared on represent
BKOB-2419||we had no press with us then I took my time wandering through the crowd
BKOB-2420||shaking hands and thanking those who plan to support me
BKOB-2421||asking those who will caucusing for another candidate to please at least make me their second choice
BKOB-2422||if you had last-minute questions by my stance on ethanol or what I intend to do about human trafficking
BKOB-2423||over and over again people rushed up to tell me that they'd never caucus before
BKOB-2424||I'm never even bothered to vote and that our campaign had inspired them to get involved for the very first time
BKOB-2425||I didn't know I counted before one woman
BKOB-2426||on the way back to Des Moines we were mostly quiet
BKOB-2427||processing the miracle of what we had just witnessed I looked out the window at the passing strip malls and houses and streetlights all fuzzy behind the frosty glass and felt a kind of peace
BKOB-2428||we were hours still from knowing what would happen the results when they came and showed us winning Iowa decisively caring just about every demographic group
BKOB-2429||our Victory propelled by unprecedented turn on including tens of thousands of people who participated for the first time
BKOB-2430||I knew none of this yet but pulling away from Ankeny about 15 minutes before the caucuses begin
BKOB-2431||I knew we'd accomplished if even for just a moment
BKOB-2433||right there in that High School in the middle of the country on a cold winter night
BKOB-2434||I'd witness the community have so long sought
BKOB-2435||the America I imagined made manifest
BKOB-2436||I thought of my mom then and how happy she would have been to see
BKOB-2437||and how proud she would have been I missed her terribly
BKOB-2438||improv and Valerie pretended not to notice cuz I wiped away my tears
BKOB-2439||chapter specs are a point margin of victory in Iowa made news across the country
BKOB-2440||the media use words like stunning in seismic to describe it noting that the results were especially devastating for Hillary who finished third
BKOB-2441||call Chris Dodd and Joe Biden probably dropped out of the race
BKOB-2442||elected officials who'd stay cautiously on the sidelines we're now calling ready to endorse
BKOB-2443||pundits declared me the new Democratic front-runner suggesting that the high level of voter engagement Iowa signaled a broader appetite for change in America
BKOB-2444||having spent the previous year as David I was suddenly cast of Goliath man is happy as I was about our Victory the new role felt
BKOB-2445||4-year my team and I had avoided getting too high or too low ignoring both the initial hype surrounding my candidacy and the subsequent reports of its imminent demise
BKOB-2446||with only five days between Iowa and the New Hampshire primary it took everything we had to Tamp down expectations
BKOB-2447||ask consider the gushing stories and TV images of me before adoring crowds Obama the icon he complained
BKOB-2448||especially unhelpful in a state like New Hampshire where the electorate many of them Independence would like to decide at the last minute between voting in the Democratic or Republican primary had a reputation for being contrary
BKOB-2449||it was hard not to feel like we were in the driver's seat
BKOB-2450||are organizers in New Hampshire Justice tenacious and our volunteers just to Spirit at the Snows in Iowa
BKOB-2451||are Rally's Drew enthusiastic crowds with lines to get in the wood wine through parking lots and stretch around the block
BKOB-2452||been in a span of 48 Hours the contest
BKOB-2453||a couple of unexpected turns the first happened during the long debate before the primary when Midway through the moderator asked Hillary how she felt when people said she was not quote likable
BKOB-2454||now this was the type of question that drove me nuts on several levels
BKOB-2455||it was trivial it was unanswerable what's a person supposed to say to something like that
BKOB-2456||and it was indicative of a double standard that Hillary specifically and women politicians in general had to put up with and which they were expected to be quote nice in ways that were never deemed relevant to their male counterparts
BKOB-2457||despite the fact that Hillary was handling the question just fine
BKOB-2458||well that hurts my feelings she said laughing but I'll try to go on I decided to interject
BKOB-2459||I said deadpan
BKOB-2460||I assume the audience understood my intentions to make an overture to my opponent while indicating scorn for the question
BKOB-2461||but whether because of bad delivery clumsy phrasing or spin by the clan communication that I've been patronizing for Hillary just message me them yet another Bor Ishmael putting down his female rival
BKOB-2462||in other words the opposite of what I meant nobody on our team got to exercise by my remark understanding that any attempt to clarify it would only fuel the fire
BKOB-2463||but no sooner had the story begun to die down the media exploded yet again this time over how Hillary was being proceeded following a meeting she had with a group of undecided voters in New Hampshire most of them women
BKOB-2464||building an empathetic question about how she was managing the stresses of the race
BKOB-2465||Hillary has momentarily choked up describing how personally and passionately invested she was at she didn't want to see the country move backward and how she devoted her life to Public Service against the pretty difficult.
BKOB-2466||it was a rare and genuine show of emotion on Hillary's Park Wonder drink
BKOB-2467||r2r Steely controlled image that made headlines and sent the cable news pundits in the orb
BKOB-2468||some interpreted the moment is compelling an authentic a new point of human connection between Hillary in the public
BKOB-2469||others deemed it either manufactured bit of emotion or a sign of weakness to threaten to damage for cannabis
BKOB-2470||running beneath it all of course with the fact that Hillary quite possibly could become the nation's first female president
BKOB-2471||and just as minded with race her candidacy surfaced all sorts of stereotypes about gender and how we expected our leaders to look and behave
BKOB-2472||the frenzy around whether he was training up or down continued right into primary day in New Hampshire
BKOB-2473||comfort in the fact that we had a big question all shoulders with a 10-point lead
BKOB-2474||so when the midday rally would schedule the local College drew a sparse Crowd by speech interrupted by Phoenix Student and what seems like an interminable response time by the medics I didn't take it as bad omen
BKOB-2475||it wasn't until that evening after the polls closed that I knew we had a problem
BKOB-2476||Michelle and I were in our hotel room getting ready for what we expected to be a Victory celebration
BKOB-2477||I heard knock and open the door to find plus tax and Gibbs standing sheepishly in the hall looking like teenagers who just crashed their dad's car into a tree
BKOB-2478||we're going to lose place that they began offering various theories on what it gone wrong
BKOB-2479||it was possible that Independence was supported us over Hillary had decided to vote and mass in the Republican primary to help John McCain figuring that we had our race well in hand
BKOB-2480||undecided women may have swung sharply in Hillary's Direction during the campaign final days
BKOB-2481||or maybe it was the fact that when the Clinton team attacked us on TV and in campaign mailing we have done enough to highlight their negative tactics along the punches to land
BKOB-2482||but there is all sounded plausible but for the moment the wife didn't matter
BKOB-2483||wow I said with a rueful smile
BKOB-2484||right now let's figure out how to cauterize a wound no hang dog looks I told them their body language had to communicate to everyone the Press donors and most of all our supporters that setback for par for the course
BKOB-2485||I reached out to our distraught New Hampshire team to tell them how proud I wasn't their efforts
BKOB-2486||and there was a matter what to say to the 1700 or so people who gathered in the Nashua School gym in anticipation of Victor
BKOB-2487||fortunately I already work with that earlier in the week to tone down any tramples tones in the speech asking him instead to emphasize the hard work that lay ahead
BKOB-2488||and I got him on the phone to instruct that other than a tip of the hat to Hillary we barely change the text
BKOB-2489||the speech I gave to our supporters that evening would end up being one of the most important of our campaign not just as a rallying cry for the disheartening but as a useful reminder of what we believe
BKOB-2490||we know the battle ahead will be long I said
BKOB-2491||but always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way
BKOB-2492||nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change
BKOB-2493||I said that we lived in a country whose history was all but built on Hope
BKOB-2494||why people Pioneers abolitionists suffragists immigrants civil rights workers who'd been undeterred by seemingly impossible odds
BKOB-2495||when we've been told we're not ready I said or that we shouldn't try or that we can't generations of Americans have responded with a simple Creed that sums up the spirit of people
BKOB-2496||yes we can the crowd began to chant the phrase like a drum
BKOB-2497||and for perhaps the first time since acts had suggested using it as a slogan for my son a campaign I fully believed the power of those three words
BKOB-2498||the news coverage following are lost New Hampshire was predictably tough order had been restored and Hillary was back on top
BKOB-2499||what a funny thing happened inside our campaign devastated
BKOB-2500||by the way our staff more unified and also more determine
BKOB-2501||instead of a drop-off and volunteers also is reporting a surge of walking across the country
BKOB-2502||perfectly from new small-dollar donors Spike
BKOB-2503||John Kerry who previously been noncommittal came out with an enthusiastic endorsement for me
BKOB-2505||all this would gratify going to confirm my instinct that losing New Hampshire wasn't the disaster commentators thought it might be
BKOB-2506||if I would have shown me to be a real Contender and not simply a novelty act the rush to annoy me have been artificial and premature
BKOB-2507||and that sense the good people in New Hampshire do me a favor by slowing down the process
BKOB-2508||running for president is supposed to be hard I told a group of supporters the next day
BKOB-2509||because being president is hard delivering change is hard
BKOB-2510||learn this thing and that meant getting back to work
BKOB-2511||and that's what we did Nevada caucus came on January 19th just a week and a half after New Hampshire
BKOB-2512||and we were surprised when we lost the raw go to Hillary
BKOB-2513||postnord Sean has to be well behind her throughout the year
BKOB-2514||presidential primaries what matters is not so much the number of individual votes you get the rather how many pledged convention delegates you win with delegates apportioned based on a series of Arcane rules unique to each state
BKOB-2515||thanks for organization strength and Rural Nevada where we campaigned hard
BKOB-2516||Elko Atomic look like Western Movie set complete with tumbleweeds in a saloon was one of my all-time favorites.
BKOB-2517||are more even distribution of both across the state resulted in us winning 13 delegates to Hillary 12
BKOB-2518||and probably enough we're able to emerge from the Baddock claiming a draw and enter the next phase of the campaign the South Carolina primary and the Behemoth 22 State super Tuesday with at least a Fighting Chance
BKOB-2519||my senior team would later say with my optimism that carry them through the loss in New Hampshire
BKOB-2520||I don't know if that's actually the case since my staff and supporters operated with admirable resilience and consistency throughout the camping independent of anything I did
BKOB-2521||the most I simply return the favor giving all that others have done to drag me across the Iowa Finish Line
BKOB-2522||what is probably true is that New Hampshire showed my team and supporters equality I've learned about myself something that proved useful not just during the course of the campaign but for the eight years that followed
BKOB-2523||I often felt steadiest when things were going to hell
BKOB-2524||Iowa may have convinced me and my team that I could end up being president
BKOB-2525||what was the New Hampshire laws that made of
BKOB-2526||I'd be up for the job I've often been asked about this personality
BKOB-2527||my ability to maintain composure in the middle of crisis
BKOB-2528||sometimes I'll say it's just a matter of temperament or consequence being raised in Hawaii since it's hard to get stressed when it's 80° and sunny in your 5 minutes from the beach
BKOB-2529||if I'm talking to group of young people I'll describe how overtime I trained myself to take the Long View but how important it is to stay focused on your goals rather than getting hung up on the daily ups and downs
BKOB-2530||there's truth in all of this but there's another Factor at play
BKOB-2531||in tough spots I tend to channel my grandmother
BKOB-2532||she's 85 years old then the last survivor the trio who raced
BKOB-2533||her health was declining cancer it spread through a body already ravaged by osteoporosis and lifetime of bad habits
BKOB-2534||her mind was still sharp and because she was no longer able to fly and I've missed our annual Christmas trip to Hawaii due to the demands of the can
BKOB-2535||I taken to calling her every few weeks just to check in
BKOB-2536||a place that your call after New Hampshire as usual the conversation didn't last long to considered long distance calls and extravagance
BKOB-2537||shirt news from the islands and I told her about her great-granddaughters and their latest mystery
BKOB-2538||my sister Maya who lives in Hawaii reported the tooth washed every twist and turn of the campaign on cable TV but she never brought it up with me
BKOB-2539||and awake my loss if you just had one piece of advice
BKOB-2540||you needed something bear you look too skinny this was characteristic of Madeline Payne Dunham born in Peru Kansas in 1922
BKOB-2541||she was a child of the depression the daughter of a schoolteacher and a bookkeeper the small oil refinery themselves the children of farmers and homesteaders
BKOB-2542||these were sensible people who worked hard when Church pay their bills and remain suspicious of bombast public displays of emotion or foolishness of any store
BKOB-2543||my grandmother is pushed against these small-town constraints most notably by married my grandfather Stanley Armour Dunham who is prone to all the questionable qualities mentioned above
BKOB-2544||together they had had their fair share of adventures during the war and after
BKOB-2545||by the time I was born all the remains of tooth rebellious streak was there smoking drinking and taste former thrillers
BKOB-2546||at the Bank of Hawaii tooted managed to rise from an entry-level clerical position to become one of its first female vice presidents
BKOB-2547||and by all accounts she'd been excellent at her job
BKOB-2548||for 25 years there would be no fuss no mistakes and no complaints even when she saw younger men that she trained promoted ahead of her
BKOB-2550||agency she was started if you asked about any of these things though she maintained that you started working at the bank not because of any particular passion for finance or wish to help others
BKOB-2551||because our family needed the money and that's what had been available to her
BKOB-2552||sometimes she told me you just do what needs to be done
BKOB-2553||it wasn't until I was a teenager that I understood just how far my grandmother's life it straight from the past you once imagined how much of herself she had sacrificed first for her husband and her daughter then four grandchildren
BKOB-2554||struck me as quietly tragic how cramped for World scene
BKOB-2555||and yet even then it wasn't lost on me it was because of tooth willingness to carry the load in front of
BKOB-2556||waking up before stop everyday to stuff herself into a business suit and heels and take the bus to work downtown office working all day on escrow documents before coming home too tired to do much else
BKOB-2557||machine brand for able to retire comfortably
BKOB-2558||travel maintain their independence the stability she provided allowed my mother to pursue a career she enjoy despite its Frederick pay an overseas posting and was why Mayan I had been able to go to a private school and fancy colleges
BKOB-2559||to show me how to balance a checkbook and resist buying stuff I didn't need
BKOB-2560||is the main reason why even in my most revolutionary moments as a young man I could admire well-run business and read the financial pages and why I felt compelled to disregard overly broad claims about the need to tear things up and remake Society from Whole cloth
BKOB-2561||tell me the value of working hard and doing your best even when the work was unpleasant in about fulfilling your responsibilities even when doing so with inconvenience
BKOB-2562||call me to marry passion with reason not get overly excited when life was going well and to not get too down when it went badly
BKOB-2563||all this was instilled in Me by elderly
BKOB-2564||plainspoken white lady from Kansas it was her perspective that often came to mind when I was campaigning and her worldview that I sent than many of the voters I encountered weather in rural Iowa or in a black neighborhood in Chicago
BKOB-2565||that same quiet pride and sacrifices made for children and grandchildren the same lack of pretension the same Odyssey of expectation
BKOB-2566||and because to possess both the remarkable strength and stubborn limitations of her upbringing because she loved me fiercely and would literally do anything to help me
BKOB-2567||and yet never fully shed but cautious conservatism that it made her quietly agonize the first time my mother brought my father a black man home for dinner
BKOB-2568||she also taught me the Tangled multi-faceted truth of race relations in our country
BKOB-2569||there is not a Black America and a white America and a Latino America and an Asian-American
BKOB-2570||where is the United States of America
BKOB-2571||it's probably the one most remembered for my 2004 convention speech
BKOB-2572||I'd intended it more as a statement of aspiration than a description of reality but it wasn't aspiration I believed him and a reality I strove for
BKOB-2573||the idea that our common Humanity mattered more than our differences with stitched into my DNA
BKOB-2574||it also describes what I felt was a practical view of politics in a democracy you needed a majority to make big change and in America that meant building coalitions across racial and ethnic lines
BKOB-2575||certainly that have been true for me in Iowa where African-Americans constituted less than 3 percent of the population
BKOB-2576||day today are campaign didn't consider this an obstacle just a fact of life
BKOB-2577||are organizers encountered pockets of racial animosity
BKOB-2578||what time's voice openly even by potential supporters
BKOB-2579||yeah I'm thinking about going for the Niger Was Heard more than once
BKOB-2580||every so often though the hostility went beyond a rude remark or a splendour

BKOB-2582||perhaps vandalizing spray-painted with racial epithets
BKOB-2583||obtuseness rather than mean that's what's more common
BKOB-2584||what are volunteers Fielding Mikado remarks that are familiar to any black person who spent time in a largely white set
BKOB-2585||A variation on the theme of I don't think of them as being black really I mean he's so intelligent
BKOB-2586||for the most part though I found white voters across Iowa to be much like those I'd quarter just a few years earlier downstate Illinois
BKOB-2587||friendly thoughtful and open to my candidacy
BKOB-2588||Concerta less about my skin color or even my Muslim sounding name and they were about my youth and lack of experience my plans to create jobs or in the war in Iraq
BKOB-2589||as far as my political advisers were concerned our job was to keep it that
BKOB-2590||it wasn't a we ducked racial issue
BKOB-2591||our website made my position clear on hot-button topics like immigration reform and civil rights
BKOB-2592||if after the town hall meeting I wouldn't hesitate to explain the realities of racial profiling or job discrimination to a rule all white audio

BKOB-2594||can we include at least one black face other than barack's Valerie gently asked at one point
BKOB-2595||or was reminding us to work harder to recruit more senior staff of color
BKOB-2597||plus tax and Gibbs made no apologies for D emphasizing any
BKOB-2598||like that might be labeled a racial grievance
BKOB-2599||or split the electric along racial lines or do anything that would box me in as quote the black Canada
BKOB-2600||to them the immediate formula for racial progress with simple we needed to win
BKOB-2601||this meant gaining support not just from Liberal white college kids but also from voters For Whom the image of me and the White House involved a big psychological late
BKOB-2602||trust me gift would wisecrack whatever else they know about you people have noticed that you don't look like the first 42 presidents
BKOB-2603||meanwhile I felt no shortage of love from African-Americans that's my license of the USA
BKOB-2604||local NAACP chapter has got in touch wanted to give me Awards
BKOB-2605||my photo regularly showed up in the pages of Ebony and jet
BKOB-2606||every black woman of a certain age told me I reminded her of her son
BKOB-2607||and the love for Michelle was at a whole other level but their professional credentials sister-friend demeanor
BKOB-2608||and no-nonsense Devotion to Motherhood she seem to just what's so many black families work toward and hope for their children
BKOB-2609||despite all this black attitudes towards my candidacy were complicate
BKOB-2610||driven in no small part by fear nothing in black people's experience told them that it might be possible for one of their own to win a major party nomination much less the presidency of the United States
BKOB-2611||in the minds of many with Michelle and I had accomplished was already something of America
BKOB-2612||the Spire beyond that seems foolish a slight too close to the Sun
BKOB-2613||I'm telling you man Martinez accept me shortly after I announced my candidacy my mother worries about you the same way she used to worry about me

BKOB-2615||I've been raised by single mom who works as a nurse in Columbus Ohio

BKOB-2617||a place where most black man can hope for little more than a Lifetime on the assembly line
BKOB-2618||when after college he decided to leave a stable job at General Motors for riskier Venture into real estate Investments
BKOB-2619||his mother had fretted afraid he might lose everything by reaching too far
BKOB-2620||you thought I was crazy to give up that kind of security Marty told me
BKOB-2621||imagine how my mom and her friends are feeling about you right now
BKOB-2622||Niger running for president but actually believing you can be present
BKOB-2623||this mindset wasn't restricted to the working class
BKOB-2624||Valerie's mother whose family had a pit in Myers the black professional Elite of the forties and fifties was the wife of a doctor and one of the guiding lights in the early childhood education movie

BKOB-2626||she wants to protect you about recent from what I asked
BKOB-2627||I'm just appointment she said leaving spoken her mother's more specific fear that I might get myself killed
BKOB-2628||we heard it again and again especially during the first months of the campaign
BKOB-2629||protective pessimism the sense in the black community that Hillary was a safer choice
BKOB-2630||the national figures Like Jesse Jackson jr. anymore grudging Jesse senior behind us we're able to get a good number of early endorsement from African-American leaders especially from younger ones
BKOB-2631||but many more chose to wait and see how I fared another black politicians businesspeople and pastors what are out of genuine loyalty towards the twins or an eagerness to back the prohibitive favorite came out for Hillary before I even had a chance to make my cake
BKOB-2632||countries not ready yet one Congressman told me
BKOB-2633||meanwhile they were activists and intellectuals who supported me
BKOB-2634||what do my campaign in truly symbolic terms I can to earlier race is not advised Shirley Chisholm Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton
BKOB-2635||a useful if transitory platform from which to raise a prophetic voice against racial Injustice
BKOB-2637||don't be more of these so-called leaders who takes the black vote for granted that supported told me
BKOB-2638||I was sensitive to the criticism for wasn't entirely wrong
BKOB-2639||a lot of democratic politicians did take black voters for granted at least since 1968 when Richard Nixon had determined that the politics of white racial resentment was the surest path to Republican Victory and thereby left like motors with nowhere else to go
BKOB-2640||it was not only white Democrats who made this calculation
BKOB-2642||you might decide to speak up anyway as a matter of conscience but you understood there be a price
BKOB-2643||the blacks the practice the standard special-interest politics of farmers gun enthusiasts or other ethnic groups only at their own peril
BKOB-2644||of course that was part of the reason I was running wasn't it they'll break us free of such constraints
BKOB-2645||hurry imagined was possible I want to be neither a supplicant always on the periphery of power and seeking favor from Liberal benefactor
BKOB-2646||nor a permanent protester full of righteous anger as we waited for White America to expiated
BKOB-2647||both parents were well-trodden both at some fundamental level for born of despair
BKOB-2648||no the point was to win I want to prove to blacks or whites the Americans of all colors that we could transcend the old logic
BKOB-2649||and we can rally a working majority around a progressive agenda that we could place issues like in a quality or lack of educational opportunity at the very center of the national debate and then actually deliver the goods
BKOB-2650||I knew that in order to accomplish that I needed to use language that spoke to all Americans and proposed policies to touched everyone
BKOB-2651||top-flight education for every child Quality Healthcare for every American
BKOB-2652||I needed to embrace white people as allies rather than impediments to change couch the aftermarket struggle in terms of a broader struggle for a fair just and generous Society
BKOB-2653||I understood the risks I heard the muted criticisms that came my way not just from
BKOB-2654||put some friends on anthesis on universal programs off of men benefits were less directly targeted to those most in need
BKOB-2655||how appealing to common interest discounted the continuing effects of discrimination and allowed whites to avoid taking the full measure the legacy of slavery Jim Crow and their own racial attitudes
BKOB-2656||this love black people with a psychic Burton expected as they were to constantly swallowing egitim and anger and frustration in the name of some far-off idea
BKOB-2657||it was a lot to ask a black folks requiring a mixture of optimism and strategic patience
BKOB-2658||cuz I tried to lead voters and my own campaign through this Uncharted Territory
BKOB-2659||I was constantly reminded that this wasn't an abstract exercise
BKOB-2660||I was bound to specific communities flesh-and-blood
BKOB-2661||filled with men and women who had their own imperatives and their own personal histories including a pastor who seemed embody all the contradictory
BKOB-2662||I was attempting to Corral I first met Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr during my organizing days
BKOB-2663||is church from the United Church of Christ was one of the largest in Chicago
BKOB-2664||son of a Baptist Minister and a school administrator from Philadelphia he'd grown up steeped in black church tradition while also attending the most prestigious and largely white schools in the city
BKOB-2665||rather than go straight into the ministry he left College to join the Marines and then the u.s. Navy training of a cardiopulmonary technician and serving as part of the medical team caring for Lyndon Johnson after his 1966 surgery
BKOB-2666||in 1967 he enrolled at Howard University
BKOB-2667||and like many blacks during those turbulent years stoked up the forceful rhetoric of black power an interest in all things African and leftist critiques of the American social order
BKOB-2668||by the time he graduated from Seminary he also absorbed the Black Liberation theology of James cone
BKOB-2669||view of Christianity that asserted the centrality of the black experience not because of Any inherent racial superiority
BKOB-2670||because cone claimed God sees the World Through The Eyes of those most depressed
BKOB-2671||did Reverend Wright came to Pastor in an overwhelmingly white denomination give some indication of his practical side
BKOB-2672||not only did the United Church of Christ value serious scholarship something he emphasized every Sunday but it had the money and infrastructure to help him build his congregation
BKOB-2673||what was once the state church with fewer than 100 members grew to 6000 during his tenure
BKOB-2674||a rollicking bustling Place contain the multitude that makeup by Chicago
BKOB-2675||bankers and former gang members can say robes in Brooks Brothers suits
BKOB-2676||Acquire The Rock classic gospel and the Hallelujah Chorus in a single serve
BKOB-2677||his sermons were. References slang humor and genuine religious insight
BKOB-2678||not only prompted cheers and shouts from his members but burnished his reputation as one of the best preachers in the country
BKOB-2679||there were times where I found Reverend Wright's sermons little over-the-top
BKOB-2681||often they sounded dated as if you were channeling a college teaching from 1968 rather than leading a prosperous congregation that included police commanders celebrities wealthy businesspeople and The Chicago School
BKOB-2682||and every so often when he said was just wrong edging close to the conspiracy theories one heard on late-night Public Access stations or in the barber shop down the street
BKOB-2683||it was asbestos erudite middle-aged light-skinned black man restraining for pre-trip got to keep it real
BKOB-2684||or maybe he just recognized both within his congregation and within himself
BKOB-2685||periodic need to let loose to release pent-up Anger from a lifetime of struggle in the face of chronic racism reason and logic be damned
BKOB-2686||all this I knew and yet for me especially when I was a young man still sorting out my beliefs and my place inside Chicago's black community
BKOB-2687||the good and Reverend Wright more than outweighed his place just as my admiration for the congregation and its Ministry I'll wait my broader skepticism Ford's organized religion
BKOB-2688||Michelle Knight Bensley joins from these members do we prove to be spotty churchgoers
BKOB-2689||like me Michelle hadn't been raised in the particular religious household and what started as once-a-month attendance became less frequent overtime
BKOB-2690||when we did go though it was meeting with my political career took off I made a point of inviting Revit right to do an invocation or benediction at the events
BKOB-2691||this has been the plan for the day I announce my candidacy
BKOB-2692||Reverend Wright was to lead the assembled crowd in the prayer before I appeared on stage
BKOB-2693||on my way down to Springfield today ahead of the event though I've received an urgent call from ex asking if I seen a rolling stone article that it just been published about my cannabis
BKOB-2694||evidently ordered set in our recent service at Trinity absorbing a fiery sermons from rev brydon quoting it in his story
BKOB-2695||is quoted saying hold on let me read this we believe in white supremacy and black inferiority and believe it more than we believe in God
BKOB-2696||seriously I think it's fair to say that if he gives the invitation tomorrow he'll be the lead story at least on Fox News
BKOB-2697||the article itself offered it generally Fairview of Jeremiah Wright and Trinity's Ministry and I wasn't surprised that my pastor would point out the gap between America's perfect Christian ideals and it's brutal racial history
BKOB-2698||spell the language used was more incendiary than anything I've heard before
BKOB-2699||and although a part of me was frustrated with the constant need to soften for white folks benefit the blunt truth about racing this country is a matter of practical politics by new axles right
BKOB-2700||that afternoon I called read and write and asked if he'd be willing to skip the public invocation and instead offer Michelle and Mia private prayer before my speech
BKOB-2701||I could tell he was hurt but ultimately into my team's great relief he went along with the new plan
BKOB-2702||or maybe episode turned up all the doubts I still had about running for the highest office in the land
BKOB-2703||it was one thing to have integrated my own life to learn overtime how to move seamlessly between black and white circles to serve as translator and Bridge among family friends acquaintances and colleagues Making Connections across an ever-expanding orb
BKOB-2704||till I felt I could finally know the world of my grandparents and the world of a rubber right as a single unified whole
BKOB-2705||explain those connections to millions of strangers
BKOB-2706||imagine the presidential campaign with all its noise and distortions and simplifications could somehow cut through hurt and fear and suspicion that have been 400 years in the making
BKOB-2707||the reality of American race relations was too complicated to reduced to a soundbar
BKOB-2708||I myself was too complicated the Contours of my life too messy and unfamiliar to the average American for me to honestly expect I can pull this thing off
BKOB-2709||maybe if the Rolling Stone article it come out earlier foreshadowing problems to come I would have decided not to run
BKOB-2710||it's hard to say I do know that in a bit of irony or perhaps Providence
BKOB-2711||it was another pastoring close friend of Reverend Wright's Dr Otis Moss Jr who helped me push through my dab
BKOB-2712||Otis Moss was a veteran of the Civil Rights Movement a close friend and Associate of dr. kicks the pastor one of the largest churches in Cleveland Ohio and a former adviser
BKOB-2713||Jimmy Carter I didn't know him well but after the article was published
BKOB-2714||he called me one evening golfers support you gotten wind of the difficulties with Jeremiah he said and heard those voices within the black community arguing that I wasn't ready or I was too radical or to mainstream we're not quite black enough
BKOB-2715||expected the path would only get harder but urge me not to get discouraged
BKOB-2716||every generation is limited by what and nose doctor monster told me
BKOB-2717||those of us who were part of the movement giants like Martin
BKOB-2718||tenants and foot soldiers like me We Are The Moses generation
BKOB-2719||we March we sat in we went to jail
BKOB-2720||sometimes in defiance of our elders but we weren't back building on what they have done
BKOB-2721||got us out of Egypt you could say but we could only travel so far
BKOB-2722||you brought a part of the Joshua generation you and others like you or respond
BKOB-2723||for the next leg of the journey most like me and can offer the wisdom of our experience
BKOB-2724||rap you can learn from some mistakes but ultimately will be up to you for God's help to build on what we've done and Lead our people in this country out of the wilderness
BKOB-2725||it's hard to overstate how much those words for 25
BKOB-2726||coming as they did almost a year before Iowa Victor
BKOB-2727||what it meant to have someone so intimately linked to the source of my earliest inspiration say that what I was trying to do was worth
BKOB-2728||it wasn't just an exercise in vanity or ambition
BKOB-2729||rather a part of an unbroken chain of progress
BKOB-2730||we're practically was thanks for the willingness of dr. moss and other former colleagues of doctor came like Reverend ctw end of Atlanta and rev Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian leadership conference to lay their proverbial hands on me
BKOB-2731||vouching for me as an extension of their historic War
BKOB-2732||the more black leaders then swing early into Cal camp
BKOB-2733||nowhere was this more evident than March 2007 when I attended the march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma Alabama that Congressman John Lewis hosted each year
BKOB-2734||I've long wanted to make the pilgrimage to the side of Bloody Sunday which in 1965 became a crucible of the battle for civil rights when Americans fully realize what was at stake
BKOB-2735||but my visit promise to be complicated the cleanse would be there I was told
BKOB-2736||and before participants gathered to cross the bridge Hillary and I were scheduled to speak simultaneously at dueling church services
BKOB-2737||not only that but our host John Lewis had indicated that he was inclined to endorse Hillary
BKOB-2738||Johnny become a good friend you taking great pride in my election to the Senate right away saying it as part of his legacy and I knew he was tortured by the decision
BKOB-2739||if I must inform explain his reasoning over the phone how long you known the clintons
BKOB-2740||howbills Administration supported many of his legislative priorities I chose not to press him too hard
BKOB-2741||I can imagine the pressure this kind and gentle man was under and I recognize that at a time when I was asking white voters to judge me on the merits a Rob Shield racial solidarity would feel like hypocrisy
BKOB-2742||but someone commemoration could have turned into an uncomfortable political spectacle but when I arrived I immediately felt at ease
BKOB-2743||prep that was being in place that have played such a large role in my imagination in the trajectory of my life
BKOB-2744||perhaps it was the response of ordinary people who'd gathered to Mark the occasion shaking my hand or giving me a hug
BKOB-2745||I'm supporting Hillary buttons but saying they were glad I was there
BKOB-2746||but mostly it was the fact that a group of respected Elders had my back
BKOB-2747||when I enter this torque Brown Chapel AME church for the service I learned that Reverend Lowery had asked to say a few words before I was introduced
BKOB-2748||it was well into his eighties by then but it lost none
BKOB-2749||imprisonment let me tell you he began
BKOB-2750||crazy things are happening out there people say certain things ain't happening but who can tell who can tell
BKOB-2751||shouted from the audience
BKOB-2752||no recently I went to the doctor and he said my cholesterol was a little high
BKOB-2753||but then explain to me the two kinds of cholesterol
BKOB-2754||there's the bad cholesterol and then there's the good cholesterol
BKOB-2755||having good cholesterol that's all right and that got me thinking how there's a lot of things like that
BKOB-2756||I mean when we started the movement lot of folks thought we were crazy
BKOB-2757||maybe right sweetie brother Lori not in the direction to Reverend Vivian who is sitting on stage
BKOB-2758||that there's another crazy negro and he'll tell you that everybody the movement was a little crazy
BKOB-2759||crowd laughed heartily but like cholesterol he continued there's good crazy and bad crazy
BKOB-2760||Harriet Tubman with the Underground Railroad she was a crazy as she could be
BKOB-2761||Paul preached Agrippa call you crazy but it was a good crazy
BKOB-2762||the crowd began to clap and cheer as Reverend Larry brought it home
BKOB-2763||and I say to you today that we need more folks in this country who are a good crazy
BKOB-2764||you can't tell what will happen when you get folks with some good crazy going to the polls to vote
BKOB-2766||the church wasn't full Revival
BKOB-2767||outside after the service was done I saw another colleague of dr. King
BKOB-2768||Fred Shuttlesworth a legendary and fearless Freedom Fighter would survive the clan bombing his house
BKOB-2769||and a white mob beating him with chains clubs and brass knuckles in stabbing his wife they attempted to enroll their two daughters in a previously all-white Birmingham School
BKOB-2770||it recently been treated for brain tumor leaving in frail but he motioned me over to his wheelchair to talk and is the marshes gathered I offered to push him across the bridge
BKOB-2771||I'd like that just fine from Shuttlesworth
BKOB-2772||and so we went the morning Sky glorious blue crossing bridge over muddy Brown River voices Rising sporadically in song and prayer
BKOB-2773||with each step I imagine how these now elderly men and women must have felt 47 years earlier
BKOB-2774||their young hearts beating furiously as they faced down a Phalanx of armed men on horseback
BKOB-2775||I was reminded just how slight my burdens were in comparison
BKOB-2776||the fact that they were still engaged in the fight and despite setbacks and sorrow and succumb to bitterness
BKOB-2777||showed me I had no cause to be time I felt renewed in my conviction that I was where I was supposed to be and doing what needed to be done at Reverend Lowery might be right in saying there was some kinda good crazy in the air
BKOB-2778||ten months later the camping shifted to South Carolina during the second and third weeks of January
BKOB-2779||I knew that our faith would again be tested we badly needed a win
BKOB-2780||on paper the state look good for African-Americans made up a large percentage of Democratic primary voters and we had a great mix of Veteran politicians and young activist both white and black in our corner
BKOB-2781||post shoulder support among white voters lagging and we didn't know whether after America
BKOB-2782||turnout in the numbers we needed our Hope was to move toward super Tuesday With the Wind didn't breakdown strictly along racial lines
BKOB-2783||but the Iowa efforts could display the possibilities of a more idealistic kind of Politics the campaign South Carolina ended up being decidedly differ
BKOB-2784||it became a brawl on exercise and old-style politics set against the landscape heavy with memories of a bitter bloody racial history
BKOB-2785||some of this was the result of the type race Rising anxieties and what seemed to be a sense within the Clinton Camp the negative campaign work to their advantage
BKOB-2786||their attacks on the air and through surrogates taken on a sharper tongue
BKOB-2787||voters from around the country increasingly paying attention all of us were aware of the stakes
BKOB-2788||our debate that week turned into an absolute slugfest between me and Hillary was John Edwards whose campaign was on his last legs and Woodson Dropout rendered a spectator as Hillary and I went after each other like gladiators
BKOB-2789||afterward Hillary left the state to campaign elsewhere
BKOB-2790||but the intensity hardly let up the campaigning on their side now left to a feisty energized and omnipresent William Jefferson
BKOB-2791||I sympathize with position Bill wasn't not only with his wife under constant scrutiny and attack but my promise to change Washington in France then partisan gridlock must have felt like a challenge to his own legacy
BKOB-2793||after all the obstructionism and she Venom the Twins and had to contend with throughout his presidency
BKOB-2794||I can hardly fault him for wanting to knock a cocky young newcomer down a peg or two
BKOB-2795||when clearly relished being back in the area
BKOB-2796||a larger-than-life figure in Peach traveled across the state offering astute observations and emanating boxycharm
BKOB-2797||is a taxonomy were for the most part well within bounds the same points item eight if I've been in his shoes
BKOB-2798||that I like experience and if I did manage to win the presidency republicans in Congress would have me for lunch
BKOB-2799||beyond that door way to call 62 brace something the Clinton had navigated definitely in the past approve trickier against a credible black canopy
BKOB-2801||employment old white audiences that Hillary quote gets you in a way that her opponents did not
BKOB-2802||Gibbs self a son of the South heard echoes of Republican strategist Lee Atwater and dog whistle politics and had no qualms about deploying some of our supporters to say so
BKOB-2803||looking back I don't know if any of this was fair Bill Clinton certainly didn't think so but it was hard in South Carolina to distinguish what was true from what was felt
BKOB-2804||all across the state I was met with great warmth and Hospitality from blacks and whites alike
BKOB-2805||cities like Charleston I experienced the much-touted newsouth Cosmopolitan diverse and bustling with Commerce
BKOB-2806||moreover is someone who had made Chicago's home I hardly needed reminding the racial division was not unique to the South
BKOB-2807||spell cuz I traveled through South Carolina making my case for the presidency Rachel attitude seemed less coated blunter sometimes not hidden at all
BKOB-2808||how was I to interpret the well-dressed white woman in a diner I visited Grimley I'm willing to shake my head
BKOB-2809||how was I to understand the motives of those hoisting signs outside one of our campaign events sporting the Confederate flag and NRA slogans yelling about states rights and telling me to go home
BKOB-2810||it wasn't just shouted words were Confederate statues that have both the legacy of slavery and segregation
BKOB-2811||Justin of Congressman Clyburn I visited JV Martin Junior High School a largely black Public School in the rural town of Dylan in the northeastern section of the state
BKOB-2812||part of the building had been constructed in 1896 just 30 years after the Civil War
BKOB-2813||repairs have been made over the decades you couldn't tell
BKOB-2814||crumbling walls busted Plumbing cracked Windows Bank unlit Halls a coal furnace in the basement still used to heat the building
BKOB-2815||leaving the school I alternated between ceiling downcast and freshly motivate
BKOB-2816||what message had generations of boys and girls received as they arrived at this
BKOB-2817||each day except for the certainty that those in power they did not matter
BKOB-2818||and whatever was meant by the American dream it wasn't meant for them
BKOB-2819||moments like this help me see the wearying effects of long term disenfranchisement the jaded filter through with many black South Carolinians absorbed are campaign
BKOB-2820||I began to understand the true nature of my adversary
BKOB-2821||I was running against Hillary Clinton or John Edwards or even the Republicans
BKOB-2822||I was running against the implacable weight of the past
BKOB-2823||be a nurse fatalism and spirit produced
BKOB-2824||black ministers and power Brokers were accustomed to getting payments to turn out voters complain about our emphasis on recruiting Grassroots volunteers instead
BKOB-2825||for them politics was less about principles and morals simple business proposition the way things have always been done
BKOB-2826||walk-in painting Michelle great-great-grandfather have been born into slavery on the South Carolina rice Plantation
BKOB-2827||what's your well-meaning black women suggesting that losing an election might be better than losing a husband
BKOB-2828||implication being that if I was elected I was sure to be shot
BKOB-2829||open change were luxury folk seem to be telling us exotic Imports would Wilt in the heat
BKOB-2830||on January 25th the eve of the primary NBC released a poll that showed my support among white South Carolinians had fallen to a paltry ten percent
BKOB-2831||the NewsCenter pain and spinning it was to be expected in town
BKOB-2832||even high African-American turnout couldn't make up for deep-seated white resistance to any black candidate much less one named Barack Hussein Obama
BKOB-2833||Axelrod always a catastrophe mode relay this to me while scrolling through his BlackBerry
BKOB-2834||unhelpfully if we lost South Carolina our campaign would likely deal
BKOB-2835||even more unhelpfully he went on to say that even if we eat
BKOB-2836||when the possibly white support would lead both the press and the cleanse to Discount the Victory and reasonably question my viability in a general election
BKOB-2837||our entire team was on pins and needles on primary day aware of all that was on the line
BKOB-2838||but an evening finally arrived and the return started rolling in the results exceeded our most optimistic projections
BKOB-2839||we beat Hillary by a two-to-one margin for nearly 80 percent of a massive black turnout and 24 percent of the white bow
BKOB-2840||we even won by ten points among white voters under 40
BKOB-2841||given the gauntlet we'd run and the hits we taken since Iowa we were Jubilee
BKOB-2842||cuz I walked onstage in laudatory Mid-Columbia to give our victory speech I can feel the pulse of stomping feet and clapping hands
BKOB-2843||several thousand people have packed themselves into the venue under the glare of Television lights I could see only the first few rows
BKOB-2844||college students mostly white and black in equal measure
BKOB-2845||I'm with her arms interlocked or draped over one another shoulders but face is beaming with joy and purpose
BKOB-2846||race doesn't matter people were chanting race doesn't matter race doesn't matter
BKOB-2847||I spotted some of our young organisers and volunteers mixed in with the crowd
BKOB-2848||once again they come through despite the naysayers
BKOB-2849||they deserved the Victory lap I thought to myself a moment of pure elation
BKOB-2850||which is why even if I quieted the crowd and drove into my speech I didn't have the heart to correct those well-meaning chapters to remind them that in the year 2008
BKOB-2851||with the Confederate flag and all it stood for still hanging in front of a state capitol just a few blocks away
BKOB-2852||race still matter plenty as much as they might want to believe otherwise
BKOB-2853||chapter seven with south carolina behind us things once again seem to start breaking our way
BKOB-2854||in the New York Times op-ed on January 27th Caroline Kennedy announced their support for me generously suggesting that our campaign had made her understand For the First Time The Inspiration Young Americans had once drawn from her father
BKOB-2855||uncle Ted Kennedy followed suit the next day joining me for an appearance before several thousand students at American University
BKOB-2856||Eddie was absolutely electric summoning all the old Camelot match
BKOB-2857||batting down the argument of inexperience once used against his brother and now directed toward me
BKOB-2858||expert call it a symbolic passing of the torch and I could see what it meant to him
BKOB-2859||it was a success and our campaign Teddy recognize the familiar court and was reaching back to a time before his brothers assassinations Vietnam white backlash riots Watergate plant closings Altamonte
BKOB-2860||back when liberalism brimmed with optimism and a can-do spirit
BKOB-2861||Same Spirit that shape my mother sensibilities as a young woman and that she had funneled into me
BKOB-2862||the Kennedy endorsement added poetry to our campaign and help set us up for super Tuesday on February 5th when more than half the nation's delegates would be determined in a single day
BKOB-2863||we'd always known super Tuesday would prevent an enormous challenge even with our wins in Iowa and South Carolina Hillary will make far better known
BKOB-2864||and the face-to-face retail campaigning we've done in the early States was simply not possible and bigger more densely populated places like California New York
BKOB-2865||but we did have though for the Grassroots infantry that expanded by the day
BKOB-2866||with the help of our veteran delegate expert Jeff Berman in our tenacious field director John Carson Pluff developed a strategy that we would execute with the same single-minded Focus the weed applied to us
BKOB-2867||rather than trying to win the big primary States and spent heavily on TV as their just to mitigate our losses we instead Focus my time and our field efforts on the caucus States many of them small Rural and overwhelmingly White
BKOB-2868||or the enthusiasm of our supporters to produce relatively large turnout and lopsided victories which would translate to Big delegate haul
BKOB-2869||Idaho was a case in point is that made sense for us to send paid staff to such a tiny solidly Republican state but they determine band of volunteers called idahoans for Obama at organize themselves
BKOB-2870||they spent the past year using social media tools like Myspace and meet up to build a community getting to know my positions on issues creating personal fundraising Pages planning events and strategically canvassing mistake
BKOB-2871||when a few days before super Tuesday plus told me that I was scheduled to campaign in Boise instead of putting in an extra day in
BKOB-2872||fornia where we were rapidly making up ground I confess that I had my doubts
BKOB-2873||but a Boise State Arena filled with 14,000 cheering idahoans quickly cured me of any skepticism
BKOB-2874||we ended up winning Idaho by such a large margin and we gave more delegates there than Hillary got from winning New Jersey estate with more than five times the population
BKOB-2875||just became the pattern 13 of the 22 super Tuesday contest when our way
BKOB-2876||and what Hillary won New York and California by a few percentage Points each
BKOB-2877||overall we met 13 more delegates
BKOB-2878||it was a remarkable achievement a testament to the skill and resourcefulness to plus our field staff and most of all our volunteers
BKOB-2879||give him a questions to understand the queen campaign continued to rise by my potential appeal in a general election
BKOB-2880||I took extra satisfaction having run the table across the so-called red part of the country
BKOB-2881||what struck me as well as the growing role did technology played in our victory
BKOB-2882||the extraordinary youth my team allowed us to embrace and refine the digital networks that Howard Dean campaign has been in motion for years early
BKOB-2883||our status is upstarts forces to trust again and again the energy and creativity of our internet Savvy volunteer
BKOB-2884||millions of small donors were helping to fuel our operation emailed links help to spread our campaign messaging and ways of the big media clip
BKOB-2885||a new communities were forming among people who previously been isolated from one another
BKOB-2886||coming out as super Tuesday I was inspired imagining that I was glimpsing the future
BKOB-2887||a Resurgence of bottom-up participation that could make our democracy work again
BKOB-2888||Miken fully appreciate yet was just how malleable this technology would prove to be
BKOB-2889||quickly would be absorbed by commercial interests and wielded by in French Powers could be used not to unify people
BKOB-2890||but to distract for the Viper and how one day many of the same tools been put me in the white house would be deployed in opposition to everything I stood for
BKOB-2891||such insights would come way after super Tuesday we went on an absolute tear winning eleven straight primaries and caucuses over the course of two weeks by an average margin of 36 percent
BKOB-2892||it was a heady stretch almost a real although the staff and I did our best not to get too far ahead of ourselves remember New Hampshire was a common refrain
BKOB-2893||understanding the battle would remain pitched aware that there was still plenty of people out there who want to see us fail
BKOB-2894||in The Souls of Black Folk the sociologist w.e.b. Du Bois described the double consciousness of black Americans at the dawn of the 20th century
BKOB-2895||despite having been born and raised on American Store

BKOB-2899||Define not by what they are what they can never be
BKOB-2900||the young man I've learned a lot from two boys running for what are because my unique parentage and upbringing or because of the times in which I come of age this notion of double Consciousness was not something I felt personally
BKOB-2901||I've wrestled with the meaning of my mixed-race status and the fact of racial discrimination
BKOB-2902||no point have I ever questioned or had other question my fundamental American
BKOB-2903||of course I've ever run for president before even before I formally announced gives our Communications team have beaten back various rumors that bubbled up on conservative talk radio or fly-by-night websites
BKOB-2904||for migrating to The Drudge Report and Fox News
BKOB-2905||there were reports that I've been schooled in an Indonesian madrassa which gained enough traction to the CNN correspondent actually travelled to my old elementary school in Jakarta 45 a bunch of kids wearing western-style uniforms and listening to New Kids on the Block on their iPods
BKOB-2906||claims that I wasn't an American citizen helpfully illustrated by picture of me wearing an African outfit that might Canyon half-brothers wedding
BKOB-2907||as the campaign progressed more lurid falsehoods were circulate
BKOB-2909||it was hard to take any of this stuff seriously initially at least not many people there
BKOB-2910||in 2008 the internet was still too slow to Spa
BKOB-2911||two removed from mainstream news operations to directly penetrate the minds of Voters
BKOB-2913||following the terror attacks of 9/11 free example I taken to wearing an American flag lapel pin feeling there was one small spread National solidarity in the face of enormous tragedy
BKOB-2914||then that's the debate about Bush's war on terrorism and the Iraq invasion war on cuz I watched John Kerry get swiftboating
BKOB-2915||and heard those who opposed the Iraq War have their patriotism questioned by the likes of call Ro
BKOB-2916||they saw my colleagues wearing flag pins in the Senate blithely vote for budget cuts to funding for veterans programs I quietly set my own pin aside
BKOB-2917||it was the match protest and more reminder to myself that the substance of patriotism mattered far more than the stomach
BKOB-2918||nobody seemed to notice especially since most of my fellow Senators including former Navy
BKOB-2919||gow John McCain regular reported flag pinless lapel
BKOB-2920||went back in October a local reporter in Iowa had asked me why I wasn't wearing a flag pin I told the truth
BKOB-2921||thing that I didn't think the presence or absence of a token you could buy it a dime store measured ones love of country
BKOB-2922||conservative Talking Heads were hammering on the purported meaning of my bear lapel
BKOB-2923||Obama hates the flag Obama disrespect our troops
BKOB-2924||months later they were still making an issue weapon which began to piss me off
BKOB-2925||just why wasn't I want to ask but only my pin habits not those of any previous presidential candidates it's suddenly attracted so much attention
BKOB-2926||not surprisingly get discouraged me from any public event
BKOB-2927||why give them the satisfaction he counseled
BKOB-2928||fair enough I was less easily persuaded though when I saw the same sort of innuendo directed toward my wife
BKOB-2929||since I want Michelle have continued to light up the campaign Trail
BKOB-2930||the girls in school we limited our appearances to tight races and a travel mostly the weekend
BKOB-2931||but wherever she went she was funny and engaging and spiteful and blonde
BKOB-2932||she talked about raising kids and trying to balance the demands of work and family
BKOB-2933||she described the values she'd been raised with her father never missing a day of work despite his ms4 mother's deep attention to her education
BKOB-2934||the family never having much money but always having plenty of love
BKOB-2935||it was Norman Rockwell Leave it to Beaver stuff
BKOB-2936||my in-laws fully embody the tastes and aspirations we tend to claim as uniquely American
BKOB-2937||and I didn't know anyone more mainstream the Michelle his favorite meal was a burger and fries who like to watch reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and who relished any chance to pass a Saturday afternoon shopping at the mall
BKOB-2938||and yet at least According to some commentators Michelle was
BKOB-2939||not first lady material
BKOB-2940||she seemed quote angry they said one Fox News segment described her as quote Obama's baby mama
BKOB-2942||disorder commentary was infrequent and some on our staff considered it on par with the usual nastiness of campaigns
BKOB-2943||that's not how much do experienced to be understood that alongside the straitjacket the political wise were supposed to stay in the adoring and compliant help me Charming but not too opinionated
BKOB-2944||straight jacket that Hillary had once rejected at Roy she continued to pay dearly for
BKOB-2945||there was an extra set of stereotypes apply to black women
BKOB-2946||familiar tropes that white girl steadily absorb like toxins from the day they first saw a blond Barbie doll
BKOB-2947||report Aunt Jemima syrup on their pancakes
BKOB-2948||but they didn't meet the prescribed standards of femininity that their butts were too big and her hair to nap
BKOB-2949||but they were too loud or hot-tempered or cutting for their men
BKOB-2950||but they were not just emasculating but masculine
BKOB-2951||Michelle has managed this psychic burden all her life largely by being meticulous about her appearance maintaining control of herself and her environment
BKOB-2952||and preparing assiduously for everything even if she refused to be cowed into becoming something she wasn't
BKOB-2953||it emerged whole with so much grace and dignity just as so many black women have succeeded in the face of so many mega
BKOB-2955||of course it was the nature of presidential campaigns that control would occasionally
BKOB-2957||it was a textbook at a few ad-libbed words that could then be diced clipped and weaponize by the conservative media
BKOB-2958||a garbled version of what you said many times before in her speeches about being proud of the direction our country was headed
BKOB-2959||the promising surgeon political participation
BKOB-2960||Fatima night largely deserve the blame we put Michelle on the road without the speech writing prep sessions and briefers that I had all the time the infrastructure that kept me organized and on point
BKOB-2961||extending a civilian in the live-fire without a flapjack
BKOB-2962||no matter reporters counts speculating as to how much Michelle Commons might hurt the campaign and how much it revealed about the Obamas true feelings
BKOB-2963||I understood this to be part of a larger and uglier agenda out there
BKOB-2965||I was less concerned about what all this meant for the campaign and I would Pain by saying how much it hurt Michelle
BKOB-2966||accost my strong intelligent and beautiful wife to doubt herself
BKOB-2967||following a misstep in Wisconsin she reminded me that she had never had a desire to be in the spotlight
BKOB-2968||and said that if her presence on the campaign Trail hurt more than it helped she would just as soon stay home
BKOB-2969||I assured her the campaign would provide her better support insisting that she was a far more
BKOB-2970||telling figure to voters than I would ever be but nothing I said seemed to make her feel better
BKOB-2971||throughout all these emotional ups and downs are campaign continued to grow
BKOB-2972||by the time we entered super Tuesday the scale of our organization had mushroomed amount of start-up transformed into a more secure and better funded operation
BKOB-2973||hotel rooms we stayed in orbit room
BKOB-2974||are travel smoother after starting out flying commercial we are gone through our share of Misadventures on Country charter flights
BKOB-2975||One Pilot landed Us in the wrong City but twice
BKOB-2976||another tried to jump-start the plane's battery with an extension cord plugged into a standard socket in the airport lounge
BKOB-2977||I was grateful when the experiment failed. Meant that we then waited two hours for battery to be trucked in from a neighboring town on a flatbed
BKOB-2978||what a bigger budget we are now able to lease our own plane complete with a flight attendant meals and states that
BKOB-2979||lyric like the new growth brought with it rules protocols process and hierarchy
BKOB-2980||our staff has grown to more than 1,000 people Nationwide and while those on her senior team did their best to maintain the campaign Scrappy informal culture where the days when I can claim to know the majority of the people who work for me
BKOB-2981||in the absence of such familiarity fewer and fewer the people I met in the course of a day addressed me as Brock
BKOB-2982||I will start now or Senator when I entered the room staff would often get up out of their seats to move elsewhere assuming that I didn't want to be disturbed
BKOB-2983||if I insisted they stick around they smile Shiley and speak only in the low murmur
BKOB-2984||it made me feel old and increasingly lonely
BKOB-2985||in an odd way still did the crowds at our rally
BKOB-2986||they have 12 to 15 20 or even thirty thousand strong at a stop
BKOB-2987||people wearing the red white and blue Obamacare
BKOB-2988||logo on shirts and hats and overalls waiting for hours to get into whatever Arena we found
BKOB-2989||our team developed something of a pregame ritual Reggie Marvin Gibbs and I would jump out of the car at a service entrance there loading dock then follow our Advance Team through corridors and back ways
BKOB-2990||usually I'd meet with local organizers take pictures with a hundred or so keep volunteers and supporters full of hugs kisses and small request
BKOB-2991||inspiring books magazines baseball's birth announcement military commission and just about everything else
BKOB-2993||videographers insisted it was a carcinogen
BKOB-2994||I hear the buzz of the crowd growing louder as I walked under the stands or bleachers to the staging area
BKOB-2995||barbecue to the sound engineer for the
BKOB-2996||the voice of God I learned it was called I listened quietly backstage there's a local person introduced
BKOB-2997||and then would come two words the next president of the United States a deafening Roar the sound of U2 city of blinding lights and after a quick fix mom or I go get them boss I walk through the curtain and onto the stage
BKOB-2998||I did the two or three times a day traveling from city-to-city state-to-state
BKOB-2999||and do the novelty wore off quickly the sheer energy of those rallies never stop killing me with Wonder
BKOB-3000||like a rock concert this how reporters describe it and in terms of noise at least that was Acura
BKOB-3001||but that wasn't how it felt when I was on stage I wasn't offering the crowd as solo performance so much as trying to be a
BKOB-3002||remaining Americans through the stories they told me all that they truly cherished in the formidable power that joined together they possess
BKOB-3003||what's my face was over and I walked off the stage to shake hands along the Rope line and found people screaming pushing and grab
BKOB-3004||imma cry or touch my face and despite my best efforts to discourage it young parents would pass howling babies across rows of strangers for me to hold
BKOB-3005||the excitement was fun and at times deeply touching it was also a little unnerving
BKOB-3006||at some basic level people were no longer seeing me I realized about my Corks And shortcomings
BKOB-3007||instead they taken possession of my likeness made it a vessel for a million different dreams
BKOB-3008||I knew a time would come when I would disappoint them only short of the image that my campaign and I had helped to construct
BKOB-3009||I realize too that his supporters could mold bits and pieces of me
BKOB-3010||outside symbol of Hope in the big fears of detractors could just as readily congeal into hay
BKOB-3011||it was in response to this disturbing truth that I've seen my life changed the most
BKOB-3012||I've been assigned Secret Service protection in May 2007 just a few months after my campaign began given the codename Renegade and around-the-clock security detail
BKOB-3013||this wasn't the norm unless you were sitting like president or in the case of Hillary former first lady
BKOB-3014||candidates typically weren't assigned coverage until they'd all but secure the nomination
BKOB-3015||reason my case was handled differently the reason Harry Reid and Bennie Thompson share of the house Homeland Security committee and publicly insisted the service move early was straightforward
BKOB-3016||the number of threats directed my way exceeded anything the Secret Service had ever seen before
BKOB-3017||I had my personal detail Jeff Gilbert wasn't impressive guy
BKOB-3018||African-American bespectacled with an open Friendly manner he could have passed for an executive at a Fortune 100 company
BKOB-3019||in our first meeting he emphasized his desire to make the transition as seamless as possible understanding that as a candidate had to freely interact with the public
BKOB-3020||Death Proof truth with work at no point that the service ever prevent us from pulling off an event the agents did what they could to downplay their presents using bales of hay rather than metal bike racks for example to create a barrier in front of an outdoor stage
BKOB-3021||the shift leaders most in their forties were professional and courteous with dry sense of humor
BKOB-3022||often would sit in the back of the plane or on the bus riding with one another about our respective sports teams or talk about our kids
BKOB-3023||Justin was a star offensive linemen at Florida and we all began monitoring his prospects in the NFL draft
BKOB-3024||meanwhile Reggie and Marvin hit it off with the other agent going to the same watering holes after campaign business
BKOB-3025||spell the suddenly have armed men and women hovering around me wherever I went
BKOB-3026||posted outside every room is occupied was a shock to my system
BKOB-3027||my view of the outside world starting to shift obscured by the veil of security
BKOB-3028||I no longer walk to the front entrance of the building when a back stairwell was available
BKOB-3029||if I worked out in a hotel gym agents first cover the windows with cloth to prevent a potential shooter from getting a site one
BKOB-3030||bulletproof barriers were placed inside any room I spotting including her bedroom at home in Chicago
BKOB-3031||and I no longer have the option of driving myself anywhere not even around the block
BKOB-3032||as we move closer to the nomination my world shrank even further
BKOB-3033||more agents were at my movements became or restrict
BKOB-3034||spontaneity vanished entirely for my life
BKOB-3035||there's no longer possible at least not easy for me to walk to a grocery store or have a casual chat
BKOB-3036||stranger on the sidewalk like a circus cage I complain to Marvin one day and I'm the dancing bear
BKOB-3038||Reggie and Marvin with Shadow gleefully during such episodes
BKOB-3039||but by the winter 2008 season prompto outings could lessen Westhoff
BKOB-3040||I knew that unpredictability made my details job harder and increase the risk to the agents
BKOB-3041||and anyway the tacos didn't taste as good as I had imagined when I was surrounded by circle of anxious agents that's mentioned the crowds and reporters that quickly assembled the moment I was recognized
BKOB-3042||when I down time I found myself spending it more often in my room
BKOB-3043||reading playing cards quietly watching a ball game on TV
BKOB-3044||to the relief of his Keepers the bear became accustomed to captivity
BKOB-3045||by the end of February we had built what looked like an insurmountable lead over Hillary and pledged delegates
BKOB-3046||is Rhombus time A+ always cautious in his assessments call from Chicago to tell me what it's some level I already knew
BKOB-3047||I think it's safe to say that if we play our cards right these next few weeks you will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States
BKOB-3048||after we hung up by set alarm trying to take measure of my emotions
BKOB-3049||it was Pride I suppose the Joelton satisfaction the mountain climber must feel looking back at the jagged ground that's been covered below
BKOB-3050||mostly though I felt a certain Stillness with Appalachian or really Sober by the thought that the responsibilities of governance were no longer a distant possibility
BKOB-3051||baclofen I found ourselves Wrangler more frequently about our campaign platform with me and fisting that all our proposals withstand scrutiny
BKOB-3052||what's because of the need to defend them during the election season experience that you're better than anyone else pay close attention to my plans for tax reformer environmental regulation and because I might have to actually implement
BKOB-3053||but projections into the future might have occupied even more of my time had not been for the fact that despite the mass showing I was going to be the nominee Hillary simply would not give up
BKOB-3054||anyone else would have she was running out of money for campaign was in turmoil with staff recriminations filling out in the Press
BKOB-3055||the only remaining chance Hillary had to win the nomination depended on convincing superdelegates the several hundred Democratic elected officials and party insiders who were given a vote at the convention and could cast it anyway that they wanted
BKOB-3056||to choose her when the party convened in August
BKOB-3057||it was a slender Reed to hang on while Hillary
BKOB-3058||started with a big early lead and superdelegates who tended to announce which way they would vote long before the convention
BKOB-3059||more more have committed to us as the primary season dragged on
BKOB-3060||and yet she's soldiered on embracing her Underdog status
BKOB-3061||the boys took on a greater urgency especially when discussing working-class concerns
BKOB-3062||offering her willingness to campaign to The Bitter End as proof that sheet fight just as hard for American families
BKOB-3064||she's like a fucking vampire plug grass
BKOB-3065||you can't kill her off or tenacity was admirable but my sympathies extended only so far
BKOB-3066||Senator John McCain Woodson wrap up the Republican nomination and another two or three months of bitter Democratic primary contest will give him a big head start on laying the groundwork for November's general election
BKOB-3067||it also meant that after almost 18 months of non-stop campaigning nobody on my team will get a meaningful break
BKOB-3068||which was unfortunate because all of us were running on fumes
BKOB-3069||that probably explains how we came to make the one big tackle error of our campaign
BKOB-3070||rather than set realistic expectations and effectively concede Ohio so that we can focus on Texas we decided to go for The Knockout Punch and try to win both
BKOB-3071||we spent massively in each state for a week I shuttled back and forth from Dallas to Cleveland to Houston to Toledo my voice raw my eyes bloodshot are they looking like a Herald of hell
BKOB-3072||our efforts had a modest effect on the pulse but they lend Credence to the Clinton campaign claim the victory for her and Texas no high oh good
BKOB-3073||mentally reset the race meanwhile the political press seem to be primaries it perhaps my final test before securing the nomination and eager to sustain a drama that has proven to be a cable news ratings Bonanza gave more prominent covers to Hillary's attacks on me
BKOB-3074||including that she ran contending that I wasn't ready to handle the 3 a.m. phone call involving a crisis
BKOB-3075||when all was said and done we lost Ohio just bicycle
BKOB-3076||and Texas just barely on a flight from San Antonio Baptist cago after the primary my team's mood was grim
BKOB-3077||Michelle barely said a word when Place attempted to lighten things by announcing that we'd won Vermont it barely elicited a truck
BKOB-3078||I'm someone else offered up the theory that we had all died and enter Purgatory where we were destined to debate Hillary for all eternity
BKOB-3079||no one laughed it felt too close to the truth
BKOB-3080||Hillary's victories didn't change the delegate count in a meaningful way but they put enough win
BKOB-3081||their campaigns fails to guarantee at least two more months of bitter primary
BKOB-3082||the results also gave her Camp fresh ammunition for an argument to be gaining traction with reporters
BKOB-3083||but I couldn't connect with white working-class voters that Latinos were lukewarm at best about me and that in an election of this importance
BKOB-3084||these weaknesses could make me a very risky Democratic nominee
BKOB-3085||just one week later I found myself wondering if they were right
BKOB-3086||it has been more than a year since I've given much thought to my pastor Reverend Jeremiah Wright
BKOB-3087||but I'm March 13th we woke up to discover the ABC News had compiled a series of short clips called from several years and disturbance skillfully package to fit a 2 minutes segment on Good Morning America
BKOB-3088||it was Reverend Wright Calling America USA of KKK
BKOB-3089||it was Reverend Wright's thing not God Bless America God damn America
BKOB-3090||it was Reverend B In Living Color explaining how the tragedy of 9-11 might impart be explained by a record of military interventions and wanton violence overseas a matter of America's chickens coming home to roost
BKOB-3091||the video offered no context for history in fact it could not have portrayed black radicalism more vividly or provided a more surgical tool to offend Middle America
BKOB-3092||Rodger Ailes fever dream within hours of its initial broadcast the video was running everywhere
BKOB-3093||inside my campaign that filters of a torpedo at blown through our house
BKOB-3094||Iceland statement forcefully denouncing the sentiments expressed in the video but also emphasizing all the good work that river right and Trinity did in Chicago
BKOB-3095||the next day I appeared in an already scheduled meeting with the editorial Boards of two newspapers and then get around Network TV interviews each time offering a condemnation of the goose expressed in the video clips
BKOB-3096||but no soundbite could offset the harm they kept rolling across TV screen the cable chatter continued nonstop
BKOB-3097||even plop admitted we might not survive this
BKOB-3098||waiter action plan football team sells for not having had our researchers obtained the videos of your earlier after the Rolling Stone article
BKOB-3099||which would have given us more time to do damage control
BKOB-3100||but I knew the blame lies squarely on my shoulders
BKOB-3101||I might not have been in church for any of the sermons in question or heard rubbing write you such explosive language but I knew all too well the occasional spasms of anger within the Black Mirror
BKOB-3102||my community that Reverend Wright with Channel
BKOB-3103||I did know how differently black and white folks still Butte issues of race in America
BKOB-3104||regardless of how much else they had in common for me to believe that I could Bridge those worlds have been pure Schubas the same Shubert's that it led me to assume that I could dip in and out of a complex institution like Trinity headed by a complex
BKOB-3105||like revving right and select as if off a menu only those things that I like
BKOB-3106||maybe I could do that as a private citizen but not as a public figure running for
BKOB-3107||anyway it was too late now while their moments in politics as in life when avoidance if not Retreat is the better part of valor there are other times when the only option is to steal yourself and go For Broke
BKOB-3108||I need to make a speech on race
BKOB-3109||the only way to deal with this is to go beg and put read and write in some kind of context
BKOB-3110||and I need to do it in the next few days the team was skeptical
BKOB-3111||we booked the next three days solid-wood events without any real time to spend what could end up being the most consequential speech of the campaign
BKOB-3112||we have no choice on a Saturday night after a day of stopping in Indiana I went home to Chicago and spend an hour on the phone with that dictating the argument I'd formed in my mind
BKOB-3113||I wanted to describe and however writing Trinity were representative of America's racial Legacy
BKOB-3114||how institutions and individuals who embody the values of faith and work family and Community Education and upward Mobility might still Harbor bitterness toward and feel betrayed by a country they love
BKOB-3115||but I had to do more than that I had to explain the other side
BKOB-3116||white white Americans might resist or even resent claims of Injustice from blacks
BKOB-3117||I'm happy with any presumption that all whites were racist or that their fears and day-to-day struggles Willis valid
BKOB-3118||unless we could recognize one another's reality I'd argue he would never solve the problems America faced
BKOB-3119||and to hint at what such a recognition might mean I would include a story that I told my first book but have never spoken about in the political speech
BKOB-3120||the pain and confusion I experienced as a teenager one to express Their Fear of a panhandler to Busta not only because
BKOB-3121||aggressive but because he was black and had made me love her any less for my grandmother was a part of me just as in a more indirect way Reverend Wright was apart of
BKOB-3122||just as they were both a part of the American fam
BKOB-3123||they're wrapped up the call with fan I remember the one time too and reverberated
BKOB-3124||has been at my wedding where Reverend Wright hug my mother and grandmother and told them what a wonderful job they've done raising me how proud they should be
BKOB-3125||smiled in a way I rarely saw her smile with Frank my mother have Pastor seem quite Sharma
BKOB-3126||although she got a bit uncomfortable later when during the ceremony Reverend Wright describe the conjugal obligations of the newlyweds and terms far more Vivid than anything to Dad ever heard in the Methodist Church of her childhood
BKOB-3127||Babs wrote the first draft pick for the next two nights I stayed up late editing and rewriting
BKOB-3128||finishing finally at 3 a.m. on the day I was to deliver it
BKOB-3129||in the holding room at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center Marty Valerie and Eric Whitacre as well as act 12th and Gibbs join me and Michelle to wish me luck
BKOB-3130||how you feel good
BKOB-3131||I figure for work we got through this if it doesn't we probably lose but either way I'll be saying what I believe
BKOB-3132||it worked the networks carry the speech life and within 24 hours more than 1 million people had watched it on the internet a record at the time
BKOB-3133||reviews from pundits and editorial writers around the country were strong
BKOB-3134||and the effect on those in the hall including Marty who was photographed for the fat tear running down his cheek indicated I've touched a chord
BKOB-3135||but the most important of you came that evening but I placed a call to my grandmother in Hawaii
BKOB-3136||that was very nice Peach pear she told me
BKOB-3138||and I'm proud of you don't you I know I said it was only after I hung up that I allowed myself to cry
BKOB-3139||the speech that The Bleak situation has taken a toll particular in Pennsylvania where Democratic voters skewed older and more
BKOB-3140||what kept us from an outright freefall was the hard work of our volunteers an influx of money from small donors that helped us run ads for 4 weeks
BKOB-3141||and the willingness of some Key State officials to bats for me with her white working-class base
BKOB-3142||Chief among them was Bob Casey the affable Irish Catholic saint of the state's former governor and one of my colleagues in the US Senate
BKOB-3143||it wasn't much of an upside for him and we had broad support and was likely to win the state
BKOB-3144||and he had enough does endorsement when the Reverend Wright video hit the news
BKOB-3145||And yet when I called Bob before my speech and offered to free him from this commitment endorse made light of the changed circumstances insisted on going forward
BKOB-3146||that's not great he said in a bit of world-class understatement but I still feel like you're the right guy
BKOB-3147||Robyn backup is endorsement with decency encourage campaigning by my side for more than a week up and down Pennsylvania
BKOB-3148||but we are pulling a begin taking backup
BKOB-3149||although we knew a victory was not in the car as we figured a three or four point loss remain Within Reach
BKOB-3150||and then oncue I made my biggest mistake of a campaign
BKOB-3152||we're running late into the evening wondering baby blanket for a question-and-answer session someone asked me to explain why I thought so many working-class voters in Pennsylvania
BKOB-3153||continue to vote against their interests and Electra publican
BKOB-3154||I've been asked a form of this question a thousand times
BKOB-3155||normally I have no problem describing the mix of economic anxiety frustration with a seemingly unresponsive federal government and legitimate differences on social issues like abortion that pushed voters into the Republican column
BKOB-3156||weather because I was mentally and physically worn out or because I was just impatient that's not how my answer came across
BKOB-3157||you're going to some of these small towns in Pennsylvania I said
BKOB-3158||I like a lot of small towns in the midwest the job has been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced
BKOB-3159||and they fell through the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration and East excessive Administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not
BKOB-3160||so far so good except I've been added
BKOB-3161||it's not surprising then that they get bitter they clean the guns or religion or an
BKOB-3162||empathy towards people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment is a way to explain their frustrations
BKOB-3163||I can provide the exact quote here because in the audience that night was a freelance writer who was recording me
BKOB-3164||to her mind my answer rest reinforcing negative stereotypes some Californians already had about working-class white voters and was therefore worth blogging about on Huffington Post
BKOB-3165||it's a decision I respect by the way so I wish you had talked to me about it before writing the story
BKOB-3166||this is what separates even the most liberal writers from their conservative counterparts the willingness to fly politicians on their own side
BKOB-3167||even today I want to take that sends back and make a few simple edits
BKOB-3168||it's not surprising then that they get frustrated I would say in my revised version and they look to the traditions and way of life could have been constants in their lives what is the faith or hunting or blue-collar work or more traditional Notions of family and community
BKOB-3169||and when Republicans tell them we Democrats despise these things or when we give these folks reason to believe that we do in the best policies in the world don't matter to me
BKOB-3170||that's what I believed that's why I got invoice from real white voters in downstate Illinois and Iowa because they sensed even when we didn't agree on an issue like abortion or immigration but I fundamentally respected and cared about
BKOB-3171||in many ways they were more familiar to me than the people I spoke to that night in San Francisco
BKOB-3172||Esparto brood about the string of poorly chosen words
BKOB-3173||not because it's subjected us to a whole new round of bludgeoning at the hands of the press in the Clinton campaign that was no fun but because the words ended up having such a long afterlife
BKOB-3174||appraisers better and cling to guns or religion for easily remember
BKOB-3175||like a fucking a pop song and we'll decided deep in my presidency is evidence that I failed understand or reach out to working-class white people
BKOB-3176||positions like truck and the policies I Champion consistently indicated the confer
BKOB-3177||maybe I'm overstating the consequences of that night and these things were bound to play out as they did and what names that means the simple fact that I screwed up and don't like being misunderstood
BKOB-3178||maybe I'm bothered by the Karen delicacy for the which one must State the obvious
BKOB-3180||one thing's for certain Fallout 4 my gas at night provided my San Francisco questioner a better answer than any verbal response I might have gif
BKOB-3181||we limped through the remainder of the Pennsylvania campaign
BKOB-3182||there was a final debate in Philadelphia a brutal Affair consisting almost in Thai
BKOB-3183||questions about flag pins right and bitter
BKOB-3184||camping across the state and invigorated Hillary tired of her Newfound appreciation for gun rights
BKOB-3185||Annie Oakley I called her we lost by nine points
BKOB-3186||hasn't been true that Ohio and Texas primaries little impact on our delicately
BKOB-3187||but there was no denying we taking a serious head
BKOB-3188||political insiders speculated that if the results for the next two big contest Indiana where Hillary had a solid lead in North Carolina where we were heavily favored
BKOB-3189||showed any further erosion in our support superdelegates might start Running Scared giving Hillary a realistic chance resting away the nomination
BKOB-3190||let's talk will probably louder several days later when Jeremiah Wright decided to make a round of public appearances
BKOB-3191||I've spoken to him only once after the video came out to let him know how strongly objected to what he said but also to say that I
BKOB-3192||on the shield him in the church from any further Fallout
BKOB-3193||I don't remember the details just that the call was painful and Bree
BKOB-3194||questions Pull-A-Part at any of these so-called reporters bother to listen to the full sermons he asked me
BKOB-3195||how could they selectively edited a lifetime of work down a 2 minutes
BKOB-3196||listening to this proud man defend himself I could only imagine his door vermin
BKOB-3197||you better start a speaker at America's leading universities and seminaries pillar of this community
BKOB-3198||illuminated with a nunchuck black churches but many white ones as well
BKOB-3199||and then in what felt like an instant it become a national object of fear in the race
BKOB-3200||I felt genuine remorse knowing this was all because of his association with me
BKOB-3201||is collateral damage in a struggle he played no part in shoes
BKOB-3202||and yet I had no meaningful way to sell his wounds
BKOB-3203||when I made the Practical if transparently self-interested suggestion that he lie low for a time and let things blow over
BKOB-3205||turn out the first two appearances were notable mainly for the restraint for the Reverend coming across as more Theologian and preacher than provocateur
BKOB-3206||then at the national Press Club the damn bro
BKOB-3207||straight my questions from the political press and flustered by their unwillingness to consider his answers
BKOB-3208||Reverend Wright Unleashed a ramp for the ages gesticulating as if he were at a Tent Revival eyes glistening with righteous Fury
BKOB-3209||he pronounced America racist at its core
BKOB-3210||he suggested that the US government was behind the AIDS epidemic
BKOB-3211||he praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan
BKOB-3212||the attacks on him we're all racially-motivated in my denunciation of his earlier statements he dismissed as just quote what politicians do in order to get elected
BKOB-3213||or is Marty with my departed he went full ghetto on their ass
BKOB-3214||I meant the white broadcast we're watching the replay I knew what I had to do
BKOB-3215||the following afternoon I found myself sitting on a bench in a high school locker room in Winston-Salem North Carolina with Gibbs staring at walls painted industrial green the stale smell of football uniforms wafting about
BKOB-3216||waiting to deliver the Press statement in which I would permanently sever my relationship with someone who would play the small but significant part in making me the man that I was
BKOB-3217||towards that once served as a tagline for the speech that put me on the national stage
BKOB-3218||someone who all his now inexcusable blind spots never showed me anything but kindness and support
BKOB-3219||you okay gives ask me
BKOB-3220||I know this can't be easy I'm not touched by Gibbs concern
BKOB-3221||what's the norm for the two of us technology pressure we were under
BKOB-3222||gift was a warrior first prankster second and on the road we usually opted for easy banter and profanity-laced Schumer
BKOB-3223||but perhaps because he grown up in Alabama better than most the complications of race religion and family and how good and bad love and hate
BKOB-3224||I'd be hopelessly Tangled in the same heart you know I'm not sure Hillary's wrong I told him
BKOB-3225||but what about me being damaged goods
BKOB-3226||I think about it sometimes how this isn't supposed to be about my own ambition
BKOB-3227||supposed to be about making the country better I said if the American people can't get past this right thing and I stagger my way into the nomination only to lose the general
BKOB-3228||what good am I done good for the head on my shoulder
BKOB-3229||you're not going to lose you said people are looking for
BKOB-3230||the real and extended in you let's just get this shit behind us once and for all so we can get back to reminding them while you should be present
BKOB-3231||my brief statement in which I unequivocally denounce been separated myself from riverride served its purpose
BKOB-3232||it didn't spoil a border concerns at least convinced reporters I have nothing further to say on the matter
BKOB-3233||back on the campaign Trail we we focused our attention on healthcare jobs the Warner Rock I'm sure of exactly how things will play out
BKOB-3234||then we got some help from an unexpected quarter
BKOB-3235||throughout the spring of 2008 gas prices have been skyrocketing mostly the result of various Supply disruptions
BKOB-3236||nothing. Voters in a bad mood like high gas prices
BKOB-3237||and eager to get out of head of the issue John McCain has proposed a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax
BKOB-3238||Hillary immediately endorsed the idea and the team asked me what I wanted to do
BKOB-3240||while it had some superficial appeal I knew it would drain an already depleted Federal Highway funds leading the future infrastructure projects and jobs
BKOB-3241||based on my experience as an Illinois state senator Fred once voted for a similar proposal
BKOB-3242||I was sure consumers Wednesday much better
BKOB-3243||in fact gas station owners were just as likely to keep prices high and boost their own profits as they were to cast the three cents a gallon savings onto motorists
BKOB-3244||somewhat to my surprise agreed in fact a suggested we highlight my opposition as more proof that I was willing to be straight with boogers
BKOB-3245||blacks Bay I still outside of gas station made my argument before a gaggle of reporters contrasting what I considered a serious long-term energy policy with the typical Washington solution to both McCain and Hillary were proposing
BKOB-3246||it was a bitter political posturing ice it designed to give the impression of action without actually solving the problem
BKOB-3247||that one both Hillary and McCain try to paint me is out of touch and I'm concerned with what a few hundred dollars might mean to America's Working Families we DoubleDown shooting a TV at on the issue and running it non-stop to Indiana and North Carolina
BKOB-3248||it was one of my prouder moments taking a tough position without the benefit of poles and in the face of punters who thought we were crazy
BKOB-3249||we began things finds in the polling data the voters were buying or arguing
BKOB-3250||no none of us at this point not even plus fully trusted data anymore
BKOB-3251||by the patient awaiting the results of the biopsy the campaign lived with the possibility of a bad outcome
BKOB-3252||the night before the primaries we held an evening rally in Indianapolis featuring a performance by Stevie Wonder
BKOB-3253||after my stump speech Valerie Marty Eric and I parked ourselves in the small room enjoying the music and beer and the cold chicken dinner
BKOB-3254||we were in a reflective mood reminiscing of
BKOB-3255||the joys of Iowa the Heartbreak of New Hampshire
BKOB-3256||volunteers we met the new friends we made
BKOB-3257||eventually someone brought up wherever ice appearance at the national Press Club and Marty and Eric began taking turns acting out some of the more excruciating lines
BKOB-3259||the kind of deep cheer inducing falling out of your chair laughter it's a kissing cousin to despair
BKOB-3260||thenx walked in wearing his most forlorn look
BKOB-3261||what was the matter I said still laughing trying to catch my breath
BKOB-3262||extra cassette I just got our overnight numbers added
BKOB-3263||12 in Indiana I just don't think we're going to make
BKOB-3264||Ramon everyone grew quiet then I said X I love you
BKOB-3265||but you are a downer either grab a drink and sit down with us or get the fuck out of here
BKOB-3266||extractor left the room taking his worries with
BKOB-3267||I looked around in my friends and raise my beer in its house
BKOB-3268||The Audacity Of Hope I said pointing our bottles we started to laugh as hard as before
BKOB-3269||24 hours later in a Raleigh hotel room
BKOB-3270||Gibbs read me the election results we won North Carolina by 14 points
BKOB-3271||more surprisingly pulled out an effective Tai and Indiana losing by just a few thousand volts
BKOB-3272||there would be six more contest before the official end of the Democratic primary season in a few weeks would pass before Hillary's belated but gracious concession speech and
BKOB-3273||but the results that night told us that the race was basically over
BKOB-3274||I would be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States
BKOB-3275||in my speech that night I began the pivot to the general election knowing there wasn't a minute to waste telling her audience that I was confident the Democrats would unite to prevent John McCain from continuing the legacy of George W bush
BKOB-3276||I spent some time talking to ask about potential running mates and then phone to to tell her the news
BKOB-3277||it is really something bear she said well past midnight I called Talk Back at our Chicago headquarters and the two of us went over what we needed to do to get ready for the convention Less Than 3 months away
BKOB-3278||wagon bed later unable to sleep I took a silent inventory
BKOB-3279||I thought about Michelle would put up with my absences held on the homefront and overridden her reticence about politics to become affect oven Fearless on the stuff
BKOB-3280||I thought about my daughter's as Lively and cuddly and engaging as ever
BKOB-3282||I thought about friends like Valerie Marty and Eric who shared my Joys and he's my burdens along every step
BKOB-3283||asking nothing in return and I thought about the young organizers and volunteers who Brave bad weather skeptical voters and their candidates missteps without wavering
BKOB-3284||I got something hard of the American people place their faith in a young and untested newcomer I just a black man but somebody whose very name is v a life story that seems unfamiliar
BKOB-3285||repeatedly I give them cause not to support
BKOB-3286||there's been uneven debate performances unconventional positions
BKOB-3287||gas and a pastor who cursed the United States of America
BKOB-3288||and I faced an opponent who proven both her Readiness and her men
BKOB-3289||ital that they give me a chance
BKOB-3290||through the noise in the chatter of the political circus they heard my call for something
BKOB-3291||even if I hadn't always been at my best they Divine what was Best in Me
BKOB-3292||the boys insisting that for all our differences we remained bound as one people in the together men and women of Goodwill to find a way to a better future
BKOB-3293||I promised myself I would not let them down
BKOB-3294||chapter 8 2008 our campaigns first order of business was unifying the Democratic Party
BKOB-3295||the prolonged and bruising primary it left hard feelings between Hillary staff and mine and some of her more Ardent boosters threatened to withhold their support
BKOB-3297||at the outset we felt obliged to get a few things off her chest
BKOB-3298||mainly having to do with what she considered unfair attacked by my campaign
BKOB-3299||is the winner I felt obliged to keep my own complaints to myself
BKOB-3300||but it didn't take long to clear the air the bottom line she said was that she wanted to be a team player
BKOB-3301||Progressive Democratic party and for the good of the country
BKOB-3302||it may have helped that she sensed my sincere admiration
BKOB-3303||why would ultimately decide that having her as a running mate post too many complications
BKOB-3304||according to the Aquabats former president roaming The West Wing without a clear portfolio
BKOB-3305||I was already considering a different role for her in the Obama Administration
BKOB-3306||call Hillary thoughts about me I can say but if she harbored any doubts about my Readiness for the job ahead she kept them to herself
BKOB-3307||first public appearance together few weeks later in a small New Hampshire town called Unity
BKOB-3308||corny but effective until the very end of the campaign
BKOB-3309||Yoshi and Bell did everything we asked of them with energy and a smile
BKOB-3310||bacoli on board the team and I got busy designing our broader electoral strategy
BKOB-3311||like the primaries and caucuses presidential general election resembles a big math puzzle
BKOB-3312||which combination of states do you need to win to get the requisite 270 electoral votes
BKOB-3314||Pennsylvania Michigan different idea
BKOB-3315||one happy byproduct of our interminable primary
BKOB-3316||was that we campaigned in every nook and corner of the country
BKOB-3317||we are battle-tested volunteers in the number of states Democrats had historically ignored
BKOB-3318||why not use that advantage to compete and traditionally republican-leaning territory
BKOB-3319||based on the data what was convinced we could win Western States like Colorado and Nevada
BKOB-3320||what a big boost in turnout among minority and younger voters he believes we even had a chance in North Carolina a state that hadn't gone Democratic and presidential election since Jimmy Carter 1976
BKOB-3321||in Virginia which handgun Democratic sense Linda Johnson in 1964
BKOB-3322||broadening the electoral map would Lyft multiple past the victory flip are you and will also help down-ballot Democratic candidates
BKOB-3323||minimum it would force John McCain and the Republican party to spend
BKOB-3324||resources Shoring up their vulnerable flank
BKOB-3325||among the various Republicans we competed for the presidential nomination I always considered John McCain to be most worthy of the price
BKOB-3326||I admired him from afar before I got to Washington
BKOB-3327||not only for its services Navy pilot and the unimaginable courage shown during five-and-a-half heroin years is a p o w
BKOB-3328||because of the conference best ability and willingness to Buck Republican party Orthodoxy on issues like immigration climate change that he'd shown in his 2000 presidential campaign
BKOB-3329||but we were never close in the Senate I often found him insightful and self-deprecating quick to puncture pretension and hypocrisy on both sides of the aisle
BKOB-3330||McCain did enjoy being something of a press Corps darling
BKOB-3331||my constituency he wants call them never passing up a chance to be on the Sunday morning news shows
BKOB-3332||among his colleagues he had a well-earned reputation for volatility
BKOB-3333||text explode portable small disagreements is pallid face reddening is Reedy voice rising at the first sign of a perceived slight
BKOB-3334||he wasn't an idea log you respected not only the customs of the Senate but also the institutions of our government and our democracy
BKOB-3335||I never saw him display the race tension atavism but regularly infected other Republican politicians
BKOB-3336||turn on more than one occasion I seen him display real political courage
BKOB-3337||once the two of us stood in the wildest Senate waiting for a vote
BKOB-3338||Johnny confided to me that he couldn't stand a lot of a quote crazies in his own party
BKOB-3339||I knew that this was part of his stick privately playing the Democrats sensibilities while voting with his cock about 90 percent of the time
BKOB-3340||but the dystany express for the far right-wing of his party was not an act
BKOB-3341||and in an increasingly polarized climate the Portico equivalent of a holy war
BKOB-3342||McCain modest heresies his unwillingness to profess the true faith
BKOB-3344||the crazies and his party mistrusted him they considered him a Rino Republican in name only
BKOB-3345||and he was regularly attacked by The Rush Limbaugh
BKOB-3346||unfortunately for McCain it was precisely these voices of the hard-right they were exciting Decor GOP voters most likely to vote in presidential primaries rather than the business-friendly strong on defense socially moderate Republicans McCain appeal to in was most comfortable with
BKOB-3347||and as the Republican primary war on McCain sought to win over some of the very people who profess to despise
BKOB-3348||has he abandoned any pretense of fiscal rectitude in favor of even bigger tax cuts in the Bush tax cuts he'd once voted against
BKOB-3349||and had this position on climate change to accommodate fossil-fuel interest
BKOB-3350||I sense the change taking place in him he seems pain I'm certain
BKOB-3351||the ones jayanti irreverent Warrior transformed into a cranky Washington Insider
BKOB-3352||fast-forward to an incoming president with an approval rating around 30 percent and a hugely unpopular War
BKOB-3353||I wasn't sure I could beat the 2000s not John McCain
BKOB-3354||but I was increasingly confident that I could be the McCain of 2008
BKOB-3355||that's not to say I thought the race would be easy in a contest against an American Hero
BKOB-3357||I knew that if I was to earn American Trust on this front
BKOB-3358||I needed to speak from the most informed position possible especially about the nation's role in Iraq and Afghanistan
BKOB-3359||which is why just a few weeks after I wrapped up the nomination
BKOB-3360||we decided I would embark on 9 days of foreign travel
BKOB-3361||the proposed schedule was brutal in addition to a brief stop in Kuwait and three days on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq
BKOB-3362||I would meet with the leaders of Israel Jordan the United Kingdom and France and deliver major foreign policy address in Berlin
BKOB-3363||if we pulled the trip off we not only dispel concerns voters might have about my ability to operate effectively on the world stage
BKOB-3364||but also highlight at a time when voters were deeply troubled by the strange alliances of the Bush years just what a new era of American leadership might look like
BKOB-3365||of course with the political pressure to flyspeck my every move there was a good chance something might go wrong
BKOB-3366||even a single blender like reinforced the notion that I wasn't ready for Primetime and tank are campaign
BKOB-3367||figured it was worth the risk walking a tightrope without a net plus said that's when we're at our best
BKOB-3368||I pointed out that it was me and not we perilously up in the air
BKOB-3369||nevertheless I left Washington and good spirits eager to travel overseas after a year-and-a-half with my nose to the campaign Grindstone
BKOB-3370||joining me on the Afghanistan and Iraq legs with the trip or two of my favorite colleagues
BKOB-3371||both of them were seasoned in foreign policy Chuck Hagel the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Jack Reacher who sat on the armed services committee
BKOB-3372||impersonality of the two men could not have been more differ
BKOB-3373||Jack a liberal Democrat from Rhode Island with slightly-built studious and understated
BKOB-3374||proud West Point graduate he'd been one of the few Senators to vote against authorizing me to Iraq War
BKOB-3375||Chuck a Conservative Republican from Nebraska was broad-shouldered expansive and full of good humor
BKOB-3376||Vietnam veteran with two purple hearts it voted for the Iraq War
BKOB-3377||what's the two shared with an abiding reference for the US Military
BKOB-3378||and a belief in The Prudent use of American power
BKOB-3379||after almost six years their views on a rocket convert and there were now two of the war's most incisive and credible critics
BKOB-3380||they're bipartisan presents on the trip help deflect any criticism that it was a campaign stop
BKOB-3381||and Trust willingness not only to travel with me but also the publicly praised aspects of my foreign policy just four months before the election for The Bold and generous gesture
BKOB-3382||on Saturday mid-july we landed at Bagram Air Base square mile installation north of Kabul set against the jagged peaks of the Hindu Kush that served as largest US military base in Afghanistan
BKOB-3383||the news wasn't good a collapse of a rock into sectarian violence and the bush administration's decision to reinforce our presence with a sustained a troop surge had siphoned military and intelligence capabilities out of Afghanistan
BKOB-3384||by 2008 we have five times as many troops in Iraq as we have bear
BKOB-3385||the shift in Focus that allowed the Taliban the Sunni Islamic insurgents we've been fighting since 2001 to go on the offense
BKOB-3386||and that Summer's the monthly us casualties in Afghanistan would exceed those in Iraq
BKOB-3387||as usual or military was doing all it could to make a tough situation work
BKOB-3388||the nolia fine commander of Coalition forces General Dave McKiernan arranged for his team to brief us on the steps they were taking to push back against Taliban strongholds
BKOB-3389||dining in the mess hall at the US Coalition headquarters in Kabul
BKOB-3390||we listen to the group of soldiers spoke of their mission with enthusiasm and pride
BKOB-3391||Earnest young men and women most of them just a few years out of high school talked about building roads training Afghan soldiers and setting up schools
BKOB-3392||only to see their work periodically interrupted for I'm done because they were understaffed or under resource was

BKOB-3394||I'll get them or help that night we slept at the heavily fortified US Embassy and in the morning we drove to the imposing 19th century Palace were president Hamid Karzai live
BKOB-3395||in the 1970s Kabul had not been so different from the capitals of other developing countries ragged around the edges but peaceful and growing full of elegant hotels rock music and college students in tents on modernizing their country
BKOB-3396||Karzai has ministers were products of that are but many had fled to Europe or the United States either during the Soviet invasion the began in 1979 or when the Taliban took over in the mid-1990s

BKOB-3400||the park has our delegation died about a banquet of traditional Afghan Fair
BKOB-3401||they did their best to persuade us for the modern tolerance of self-sufficient Afghanistan was Within Reach so long as American troops and cash continue to flow
BKOB-3402||I might have believed cars last words were not for reports of rampant corruption and mismanagement within his
BKOB-3403||much of the Afghan Countryside was beyond the control of Kabul and Karzai rarely venture.
BKOB-3404||bro I'm not just on US forces but on a patchwork of alliances with local Warlords to maintain what power he possessed
BKOB-3405||I thought about it seeming isolation later that day as a pair of Blackhawk helicopters flew us over mountainous terrain on our way to a US forward operating base or fob your helmet on Afghanistan Southern plateau
BKOB-3406||the small villages of mud and wood that we saw from the air Blended seamlessly into the done colored rock formations with barely a paved Road or an electrical line inside
BKOB-3407||I tried to imagine what the people below thought of the Americans and their meds
BKOB-3408||order unprecedented this Sumptuous Palace or even the idea of a nation state
BKOB-3409||not much I suspected they were just trying to survive
BKOB-3410||buffeted by forces is constant and unpredictable as the winds
BKOB-3411||and I wondered what it might take down the courage and skill of our troops despite the best laid plans of analysts in Washington
BKOB-3412||reconcile American ideas what Afghanistan should be for the landscape that for hundreds of years have proven impervious to change
BKOB-3413||hotspot stayed with me that we left that Gana standing headed to a rock spending the night in Kuwait along the way

BKOB-3415||the internationally certified election if she apply minister nouri al-maliki
BKOB-3416||any Brokers agreement with Sunni tribal leaders in the western province of anbar
BKOB-3417||Unleashed by The Original US invasion and subsequent bungling by men like Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer
BKOB-3418||John McCain interpreted the recent successes to main we were winning the fight and would continue to do so long as we stay the course and and what had become a common not from among Republicans listen to our commanders on the ground
BKOB-3419||I drew a different conclusion after five years of heavy u.s. involved
BKOB-3420||Saddam Hussein's on no evidence of wmds and a democratically-elected government installed
BKOB-3422||every night dentist and we had a chance to mingle with troops and visit an apple being on bar
BKOB-3423||for meeting with prime minister Maliki he wasn't our figure vaguely Missoni and it has long faced heavy 5 Shadow and indirect gays
BKOB-3424||we have cause to be stressed for his new job was both difficult and dangerous
BKOB-3425||you trying to balance the demands of domestic ship power blocks that has elected him and the Sunni population that has dominated the country under Saddam
BKOB-3426||he also had to manage countervailing pressures from the US benefactors and Iranian Neighbors
BKOB-3427||Marquis tires to run where he had lived in exile for many years as well as his uneasy alliances with certain ship malicious made him a mathematician Saudi Arabia and other us allies in the Persian Gulf region
BKOB-3428||underscoring just how much the US invasion had strengthened around strategic position there
BKOB-3429||whether anyone in the bush White House to discuss such a predictable consequence before ordering US troops into Iraq was uncertain
BKOB-3430||but the administration sure wasn't happy about it now
BKOB-3431||my conversations with several high-ranking generals and diplomats make clear that the White House has interest in maintaining a sizable troop presence in Iraq was about more than a simple desire to ensure stability and reduce violence
BKOB-3432||laws about preventing Iran from taking further advantage of the mess we made
BKOB-3433||given that the issue was dominating the foreign policy debate both in Congress and in the campaign
BKOB-3434||Maliki Through The Interpreter whether she thought Iraq was ready for a withdrawal of US troops
BKOB-3435||we were all surprised by his unequivocal response
BKOB-3436||expressed deep appreciation for the efforts of us and British forces and hope that America would continue to help pay for the training and maintenance of a rocket forces
BKOB-3437||he agreed with me that we set a time frame for us withdrawal
BKOB-3438||it was unclear what was behind molecules decision push an accelerated timetable for us withdrawal
BKOB-3439||simple nationalism sympathies
BKOB-3441||but as far as the political debate in the United States was concerned
BKOB-3442||multi-position have big implications
BKOB-3443||it was one thing for the White House or John McCain to dismiss my calls for a timetable for withdrawal as weak and irresponsible a version of Cut and Run
BKOB-3444||it was another to dismiss the same idea coming from rocks newly elected leader
BKOB-3445||of course at the time Maliki still didn't really call the shots in this country
BKOB-3446||the commander of Coalition forces in Iraq General David Petraeus
BKOB-3447||it was my conversation with him that foreshadows some of the central foreign policy debates
BKOB-3449||we took a helicopter together from the Baghdad airport to the heavily-fortified green zone talkin all the way
BKOB-3450||and although the substance of our conversation would appear in a press write-ups as far as my campaign team was concerned that was just fine
BKOB-3451||the photographs they cared about images of me see the next door 4-star General aboard a Blackhawk helicopter wearing a headset Navy eighter glasses
BKOB-3452||apparently approved vigorous contrast to an unfortunate depiction of my Republican opponent that happened this purpose on the very same day
BKOB-3453||McCain riding shotgun on a golf cart with former President George HW Bush the two of them resembling a couple of pastel sweater Grandpa's on their way to a country club picnic
BKOB-3454||meanwhile sitting together in a spacious office Coalition headquarters
BKOB-3455||depressed and I discussed everything for the need for more Arabic language specialist in the military for the vital role development project would play Indie legitimate organizations in both bring the new governor
BKOB-3456||what's deserve credit for having selected this particular General to write would have been a sinking ship
BKOB-3457||if we had unlimited time and resources if America's long-term National Security interest absolutely dependent on creating a functioning and Democratic State Ally to the United States in Iraq
BKOB-3458||Enterprise's Approach at as good a chance as any other cheating
BKOB-3459||we did not have unlimited time of resources
BKOB-3460||are you boiled it down that's what the argument over withdraw was about
BKOB-3461||how much did we continue to give and when would it be enough
BKOB-3462||as far as I was concerned we were approaching that why
BKOB-3463||our national security required a stable Iraq but not a showcase for American Nation do
BKOB-3464||believe that without a more sustained us investment
BKOB-3465||whatever James we've made we're still easily reverse
BKOB-3466||I asked how long it would take for them to feel permanent two years 510
BKOB-3467||you couldn't stay but announcing a fixed timetable for withdrawal he believed would only give the enemy the chance to wait us out
BKOB-3468||but one that always be true you can stay to the point
BKOB-3469||and what about sterle's indicating the strong majority of a Rockies bulshit answer me and wearied of the occupation and wanted us out sooner rather than later
BKOB-3470||that was a problem we would have to manage she said the conversation was cordial and I couldn't blame Petraeus for wanting to finish the mission
BKOB-3471||if I were in your shoes I told him I'd want the same thing
BKOB-3472||the president's job required looking at a bigger picture I sent just to see himself had to consider trade-offs and constraints but officers under his command did not
BKOB-3473||information how should we wait an additional two or three years in a rock at a cost of nearly ten billion dollars a month against the nature dismantle for Al-Qaeda operations in Northwestern Pakistan
BKOB-3474||war against the schools and Roads not built back home
BKOB-3475||or the emotion of Readiness should another crisis arise
BKOB-3476||or the human toll exacted on our troops in the family
BKOB-3477||General Petraeus nodded politely and said he looked forward to seeing me after the election
BKOB-3478||as our delegation tickets believe that day I doubt it I persuaded him at the wisdom of my position
BKOB-3479||any more than he had persuaded me to be a worldly
BKOB-3480||could I have the Diplomatic skills the knowledge and stamina
BKOB-3481||the authority to command the down for the trip was designed to answer such questions and elaborate audition on the international stage
BKOB-3482||for bilateral meetings with King Abdullah and Jordan Gordon Brown in England Nicolas Sarkozy in France
BKOB-3483||I'm at Wadala Merkel in Germany where I also spoke to an audience of 200,000 people gathered in front of Berlin's historic Victory call declaring that just isn't earlier generation had torn down the wall that once divided Europe
BKOB-3484||it was now our job to tear down the other less visible walls between rich and poor between races and tribes
BKOB-3485||between Natives and immigrants between Christians Muslims and Jews
BKOB-3486||over a couple of marathon Israel in the bank I'm at separately with Israeli Prime Minister Ecuador and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas
BKOB-3487||but I did my best to understand not only the logic but also be emotions behind an ancient and seemingly intractable conflict
BKOB-3488||and the Thomas throat I listen to Paris describe the terror of Rocket shells launched from nearby Gaza land in just a few yards from the children's bedrooms
BKOB-3489||in Ramallah I heard Palestinian speak of the daily humiliations endure that Israeli security checkpoints
BKOB-3490||according to Gibbs us press thought I passed the looking presidential test with flying colors
BKOB-3491||for me the trip went beyond their Optics
BKOB-3492||even more than back home I felt the immensity of the challenges that awaited me if I won
BKOB-3493||the grace I need to do the job he stopped were on my mind on the morning of July 24th when I arrived at the Western Wall in Jerusalem
BKOB-3494||do 2,000 years ago to protect the sacred Temple Mount and viewed as a gateway to Divinity the place where God accepted the prayers of all who visit
BKOB-3495||dispensaries Pilgrims from around the world made a custom of committing their prayers to paper and stuffing them into the cracks of the wall
BKOB-3496||before coming that morning at run my own prayer on a piece of Hotel stationery
BKOB-3497||and the gray light of dawn surrounded by my Israeli hosts a Secret Service agents and the clatter of media cameras about my head before the wall is bearded Rabbi rid of thumb calling for peace in the holy city of Jerusalem
BKOB-3498||as was the custom highway to hand on the South Limestone
BKOB-3499||throwing myself in silent contemplation and then wadded-up my piece of
BKOB-3500||front pushed too deep into a crevice in the wall Lord I'd written
BKOB-3501||protect my family and me forgive me my sins
BKOB-3502||and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just
BKOB-3503||and make me an instrument of your will I had assumed those words were between me and God
BKOB-3504||but the next day they showed up in an Israeli newspaper
BKOB-3505||for cheating eternal life on the internet apparently a bystander Doug my scrap of paper out of the wall after we left
BKOB-3506||reminder the price became was stepping onto the world stage
BKOB-3507||the line between my private and public life was dissolved
BKOB-3508||it's thought than gesture was now a matter of global interest
BKOB-3509||get used to it I told myself it's part of the deal
BKOB-3510||returning for my overseas trip I felt like an astronaut or an Explorer just back from an arduous Expedition
BKOB-3511||charged with adrenaline and vaguely disoriented by ordinary life
BKOB-3512||only a month ago before the Democratic National Convention and cited try to normalize things a little by taking my family to Hawaii for a week
BKOB-3513||Echo Plus the matter wasn't Up For Debate after campaigning for 17 months I needed to recharge and started Michelle
BKOB-3514||also to help with deteriorating rapidly
BKOB-3515||and while we could know exactly how long my grandmother might have
BKOB-3516||I didn't intend to repeat the mistake I made with my mother
BKOB-3517||most of all I wanted some time with my daughters
BKOB-3518||as far as I could tell the campaign had defected are bonds
BKOB-3519||only it was a chatty and inquisitive with me as ever
BKOB-3520||Sasha is buoyant and affectionate when I was on the road I talked to them by phone every night about school the friends or the latest SpongeBob episode
BKOB-3521||when I was home I read to them challenge them to board game and occasionally knock out with them for ice cream
BKOB-3522||still I could see from week-to-week how fast they were growing
BKOB-3523||other limbs always seemed an inch or two longer than I remember their conversations at dinner more sophisticated
BKOB-3524||these changes serve to measure all that I've missed
BKOB-3525||the fact that I hadn't been there to nurse them when they were sick
BKOB-3526||hug them when they were scared or laugh at the jokes I told
BKOB-3527||as much as I believe in the importance of what I was doing
BKOB-3528||I knew I would never get that time back and often found myself questioning the wisdom of the trade
BKOB-3529||I was right to feel guilty it's hard to overstate the burden I placed on my family during those two years I ran for president
BKOB-3530||how much I relied on Michelle's fortitude in parenting skills
BKOB-3531||and how much I depended on my daughter's friend natural could share in maturity
BKOB-3532||earlier this summer to bring the girls enjoy me like a man in Butte Montana on the 4th of July which also happened to be Malia's 10th birthday
BKOB-3533||my sister Maya her family decide to come as well
BKOB-3534||we had our share of fun that day visiting a mining Museum and squirting one another with water guns
BKOB-3535||but much of my time was still devoted to vote getting the girls tried to do the flea beside me as I shook hands along the town's Parade route
BKOB-3536||Eastern machine washing mistaken afternoon rally
BKOB-3537||in the evening after the fireworks I promise we're cancelled due to thunderstorms
BKOB-3538||we held an impromptu birthday party in a windowless conference room on the lower level of the local Holiday Inn
BKOB-3539||advanstaff done its best to liven up the place with a few balloons there was pizza and salad and a cake from the local supermarket
BKOB-3540||film and I watch Malia blow out the candles and Make-a-Wish for the year ahead
BKOB-3541||I wondered whether she was disappointed but she might later look back on this day is proof of her father's misplaced priorities
BKOB-3542||Justin Kristen Jarvis or Michelle's young AIDS pulled out an iPod
BKOB-3543||hook it up to a portable speaker grab my hand to pull me out of my chair
BKOB-3544||pretty soon everyone was dancing to Beyonce in the Jonas Brothers sausage gyrating Malia shaking their short curls Michelle and Maya letting Loose as I showed off my best dad moose
BKOB-3545||after about half-an-hour all of us halfway out of breath
BKOB-3546||Malia came over and sat on my lap daddy she said
BKOB-3547||this is the best birthday ever I kissed the top of her head and held her tight
BKOB-3548||not letting her see my eyes get Misty those were my daughter
BKOB-3549||that's what I'd given up my being away so much
BKOB-3550||that's why the days we stolen Hawaii that August 4th
BKOB-3551||even if we lost some ground against McCain in the polls
BKOB-3552||splashing in the ocean with the girls letting them bury me in the span without having to tell them I had to go on a conference call or leave for the airport
BKOB-3553||it was worth it watching the sun go down over
BKOB-3554||with my arms wrapped around Michelle just listening to the wind rustling Palms
BKOB-3555||Pashto Bronner living room couch barely able to razor head still smiling with quiet satisfaction is our great-granddaughters laughed and played on the floor
BKOB-3556||and then feeling her model blue vein hand squeeze mine for perhaps the last time
BKOB-3557||precious Sacrament I couldn't leave the campaign entirely behind while I was in Hawaii updates from the team thank you calls to supporters
BKOB-3558||preliminary outline of my convention speech that I drafted and sent the fax
BKOB-3559||and it was the single most consequential decision I had to make now that I was the nominee
BKOB-3560||who would be my running mate I've never let down together Tim Kaine of Virginia and Senate colleague Joe Biden of Delaware
BKOB-3561||at the time I was much closer to ten but then the first prominent elected
BKOB-3562||outside of Illinois endorsement for president and worked hard as one of my top campaign surrogates
BKOB-3563||our friendship came easily we are roughly the same age as similar Midwestern routes similar temperaments and even some more resumes
BKOB-3564||timid worked on a mission in Honduras while a student at Harvard Law School and practice civil rights law before going into politics
BKOB-3565||as for Joe we could have been more different at least on paper
BKOB-3566||he was 19 years my senior I was running as the Washington Outsider Joe it's been 35 years in the Senate including extensive chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee
BKOB-3567||in contrast to my peripatetic. Bring Joe had deep roots in Scranton Pennsylvania Enterprises working-class Irish heritage
BKOB-3568||after we were elected and we discovered our respective hours for Bears both boot makers had left Ireland for America just five weeks apart
BKOB-3569||and if I was seeing is temperamentally cool and Collective measured and how I use my words Joe was all worn
BKOB-3570||a man without inhibition happy to share whatever popped into his head
BKOB-3571||it was an endearing trait for he genuinely enjoyed people
BKOB-3572||you can see it if you work the room is handsome face always casting the dazzling smile and just inches from whoever he was talking to
BKOB-3573||asking a person where they were from telling the story about how much you love their hometown
BKOB-3574||best calzones I ever tasted or how they must know so-and-so and absolutely great guys
BKOB-3575||flattering their children anyone ever tell you you're gorgeous
BKOB-3576||or their mother you can't be a day over fourty
BKOB-3577||and then on to the next person and the next until he touched every soul in the room with a flurry of handshakes hugs kisses back slaps compliments and one-liners
BKOB-3578||Joe's enthusiasm had its downside in a town filled with people who like to hear themselves talk
BKOB-3579||he had no. In a speech was scheduled for 15 minutes went on for at least half an hour
BKOB-3580||April schedule for half an hour there was no telling how long you might talk
BKOB-3581||is Soliloquy is drink mid hearing for legendary
BKOB-3582||his lack of a filter periodically got him in trouble is when during the primaries it pronounced me quote articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy
BKOB-3583||afraid Shirley men of the compliment but interpreted by some as suggesting that such characteristics and a black man we're noteworthy
BKOB-3584||as I Came To Know Joe though I found of occasional Gatsby trivia
BKOB-3585||compared to its tracks on domestic issues he was smart practical and do this summer
BKOB-3586||his experience in foreign policy was Broad and deep
BKOB-3587||short-lived run in the primaries he had impressed me with his skill and discipline his debater
BKOB-3588||Comfort on a national stage most of all Joe had heart
BKOB-3589||you don't freak out bad stutter as a child would probably explain is bigger than tashman forwards and two brain aneurysms in middle age
BKOB-3590||Impala pixie note early success and suffered embarrassing defeats
BKOB-3591||and he didn't order unimaginable tragedy
BKOB-3592||a 1972 just weeks after Joe was elected to the Senate
BKOB-3593||his wife and baby daughter had been killed and his two young Sons bonehunter injured in a car accident
BKOB-3594||in Wake of this lost his colleagues and siblings had to talk him out of quitting the Sun
BKOB-3595||but he'd arrange the schedule to make a daily hour-and-a-half Amtrak commute between Delaware and Washington to care for his voice
BKOB-3596||practice he continued for the next three decades
BKOB-3597||the Joe has survived such heartbreak was a credit to his second wife Jill a lovely and understated teacher who'd met three years after the accident and would raise Joe son who's wrong
BKOB-3598||anytime you saw the binds together it was immediately obvious just how much his family sustained
BKOB-3599||pride and joy he took in Bow then Delaware's attorney general in a rising star in state politics
BKOB-3600||and Hunter a lawyer in DC and Ashley a social worker in Wilmington
BKOB-3601||and in their beautiful grandkids family had sustained Joe
BKOB-3602||what's so to head a buoyancy of character
BKOB-3603||tragedy and setbacks may have scarred him I would learn
BKOB-3604||but they had made him bitter or cynical it was on the basis of those Impressions but I'd ask Joe to undergo the initial vetting process made me while I was campaigning in Minnesota
BKOB-3605||she was resisting the first like most Senators Joe had a healthy ego and just like the idea of playing second fiddle
BKOB-3606||our meeting began with him explaining all the reasons why the job of Vice President might be a step down for
BKOB-3607||along with an explanation of why he'd be the best choice
BKOB-3608||I assured him that I was looking not for a ceremonial standing but for a partner
BKOB-3609||if you pick me Joe said I want
BKOB-3610||be able to give you my best judgment and Frank advice you'll be the president and I'll defend whatever you decide
BKOB-3611||but I want to be the last guy in the room on every major decision
BKOB-3612||I told him that was a commitment I could make both acts and fluffed out the world attempt came in like me they knew he'd fixed be mostly into an Obama administration
BKOB-3613||but also like me they wondered whether putting two relatively young inexperienced and liberal civil rights attorneys on a ticket
BKOB-3614||might be more hope and change the motor could handle Joe carry his own risk
BKOB-3615||we figure this lack of just plain front of microphone might result in unnecessary controversy
BKOB-3616||Star Wars old school he like the Limelight
BKOB-3617||it wasn't always self-aware I sense that he could get prickly if you thought he wasn't given his due
BKOB-3618||equality to my flare up when dealing with a much younger boss
BKOB-3619||and yet I found the contrast between this compelling I like the fact that Joe would be more than ready to service
BKOB-3620||send if something happened to me and it might reassure those still worried I was too young
BKOB-3621||his foreign policy experience would be valuable during a time when we were embroiled in two Wars
BKOB-3622||so what is relationships in Congress and its potential to reach voters still wary of electing an African-American present
BKOB-3623||What mattered most was what my gut told me
BKOB-3624||but Joe was decent honest and loyal
BKOB-3625||I believe that he cared about Ordinary People and it when things got tough I can trust
BKOB-3626||I would not be disappointed how the Democratic National Convention in Denver got put together is largely a mystery to me
BKOB-3627||I was consulted on the order of the program of the Four Knights that would take place
BKOB-3628||the themes that would be developed the speaker schedule
BKOB-3629||I was showing biographical videos for approval and asked for a list of family and friends would need accommodations
BKOB-3630||watch checked in to see if I was game hold the conventions final night not in a traditional indoor arena
BKOB-3631||but at Mile High Stadium home of the Denver Broncos
BKOB-3632||what is passive close to 80,000 they could accommodate the tens of thousands of volunteers from across the country have been the foundation of our campaign
BKOB-3633||it also had no roof which meant we be exposed to the elements
BKOB-3634||what if it rains last we put 100 years worth of weather reports for Denver on August 28th at 8 p.m. plus
BKOB-3635||it's only rained once but at this year's the second time do we have a back-up plan
BKOB-3636||once we lock in the stadium plus said there's no going back
BKOB-3637||gave me a flight with maniacal Grim remember we're always at our best without a net Why Stop Now
BKOB-3638||why indeed Michelle and the girls travel to Denver a couple of days ahead of me while I campaigned in a few States so by the time I arrived the festivities were in full swing
BKOB-3639||fat white trucks in Preston
BKOB-3640||like an army Lane speech free better talk T-shirts hats tote bags and jewelry adorned with our rising sun logo or my
BKOB-3641||Charleston Paparazzi clicked away at the politicians and occasional celebrity watering the arena
BKOB-3642||unlike the 2000 convention when I've been the kid pressing his face against the candy store window or the 2004 convention when Mikey noted Place me at the center of the spectacle
BKOB-3643||and I found myself both the starring attraction and on the periphery trapped in a hotel suite or looking out the window of my secret service vehicle arriving in Denver only on the second to last night of the convention
BKOB-3644||it was a matter of security I was told as well as deliberate spacecraft
BKOB-3645||if I remained out of sight anticipation would only do
BKOB-3646||it made me feel restless and I'll make her move as if I were merely inexpensive props be taken out of the box under special conditions
BKOB-3647||turn moment's doubt in my mind
BKOB-3648||remember Malia and Sasha and three of those granddaughters rolling around on a pilot air mattresses in our hotel suite all of them giggling lost in their secret games and wholly indifferent to the hoop lot below
BKOB-3649||I remember Hillary stepping up to the microphone representing the New York delegates informally making the motion to vote me in is the Democratic nominee a powerful gesture of unity
BKOB-3650||and I remember sitting in the living room with a very sweet family and supporters in Missouri
BKOB-3651||making small talk and munching on snacks before Michelle appeared on the television screen
BKOB-3652||luminescent an aquamarine dress that deliver the conventions opening-night address
BKOB-3653||I deliberately avoided reading Michelle speech beforehand that wine the metal in the processor at the pressure
BKOB-3654||haven't seen her on the campaign Trail I have no doubt she be good
BKOB-3655||listen to Michelle tell her story that night singer talked about her mom and dad the sacrifices they made
BKOB-3656||and the values they passed on hearing her Tracer unlikely journey and described her hopes for our daughters
BKOB-3657||having this woman who had shouldered so much about for the fact that I've always been true to my family into my convictions
BKOB-3658||sing the convention hall audience the network anchors and the people sitting next to me transfixed
BKOB-3659||well I couldn't have been prouder contrary to what some commentators said at the time
BKOB-3660||I like them quote find her voice that night a national audience finally had a chance to hear that voice unfilter
BKOB-3661||48 hours later I found myself hold up with Fab Xanax and hotel room fine-tuning the acceptance speech I delivered the following evening
BKOB-3662||it has been tougher right we felt the moment called for more prose and poetry but a hard-hitting critique of Republican policies and an account of specific step by and tended to take a present
BKOB-3663||all without being too long to dry or two
BKOB-3664||it is required provisions and I have had little time to practice
BKOB-3665||as I stood behind a mock Podium delivering my lines dam is fear was more workmanlike than inspire
BKOB-3666||only once did the full meaning of my nomination hit me
BKOB-3667||by coincidence the last night of the convention fell on the 45th anniversary of the March on Washington and dr. King's historic I Have a Dream speech
BKOB-3668||we decided not to draw too much attention to that fact figuring that it was a poor idea to invite comparisons to one of the greatest speeches in American history
BKOB-3669||but I did pay tribute to the miracle of that young preacher from Georgia in the closing bars of Myspace
BKOB-3670||Gordon something he said to the people who gathered on the National Mall that day in 1963
BKOB-3671||we cannot walk alone and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always March ahead
BKOB-3672||we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone
BKOB-3673||I remember those particular line from Doctor King speech
BKOB-3674||but if I read them aloud during practice I found myself thinking about all the older black volunteers I've met in our offices around the country
BKOB-3675||the way the clutch my hands and tell me they never thought they'd see the day when a black man would have a real chance to be president
BKOB-3676||I thought about the seniors who wrote to me to explain how they woken up early and been first in line to vote during the primaries even though they were sick or disabled
BKOB-3677||I thought about the doorman janitors secretaries clerks dishwashers and drivers encountered any time I passed through hotels Conference Centers are office building
BKOB-3678||David waiver give me a thumbs-up or she'll accept the handshake
BKOB-3679||black men and women of a certain age who like Michelle's parents
BKOB-3680||and quietly done what was necessary to feed their families and send their kids to school and now recognized in me some of the fruits of their labor
BKOB-3681||I thought of all the people would sat in jail or join the Marciano
BKOB-3682||Washington fourty to fifty years ago and wondered how they would feel when I walked on the bed stage in Denver
BKOB-3683||how much they had seen their country transformed
BKOB-3684||and how far things still were from what they'd hoped you know what give me a second I said my voice catching in my throat
BKOB-3685||by starting to Brent I went to the bathroom and splash some water on my face
BKOB-3686||when I returned a few minutes later Babs acts in the teleprompter operator all quiet I'm sure what to do
BKOB-3687||sorry about that I said let's try it again from the top
BKOB-3688||I have no trouble getting through the speech the second time around
BKOB-3689||the only Interruption came about halfway through my oration when we heard a knock on the door and found a hotel server with a Caesar salad standing in the hall
BKOB-3690||what can I say except with a sheepish grin I'm starving
BKOB-3691||and by the following you cuz I walked out onto the broad blue carpeted stage under a clear and Open Sky two addresses
BKOB-3692||full of people with Millions more across the country
BKOB-3693||all that I felt was calm the night was warm
BKOB-3694||the Roar from the crowd infectious The Flash from thousands of cameras marrying the Stars overhead
BKOB-3695||well finished speaking Michelle in the girls and then Joe and Joe Biden join me to wait through Floria confetti
BKOB-3696||across the stadium we can see people laughing and hugging waving flags the beat of a song by country artist Brooks & Dunn that have become a staple to the campaign Trail
BKOB-3697||only in America historically a presidential candidate enjoy the healthy bounce in the polls after a successful convention
BKOB-3698||by all accounts are that been close to flawless
BKOB-3699||are pollsters reported that after Denver my lead over John McCain head indeed widen to at least five points
BKOB-3700||that lasted about a week John McCain's campaign have been flailing
BKOB-3701||despite the fact that he wrapped up the Republican nomination three months before I secured mine he has achieved much in the way of momentum
BKOB-3702||swing voters remain unpersuaded by a proposal for further tax cuts on top of those bushes already passed
BKOB-3703||in the new more polarized climate McCain himself appeared hesitant to even mention issues like immigration reform or climate-change we should previously burnished his reputation as a Maverick inside of party
BKOB-3704||In fairness I've been dealt a bad hand iraq-war remained as unpopular as ever
BKOB-3705||the economy already in recession was rapidly worsening and sore Bush's approval numbers
BKOB-3706||in an election likely to hinged on the promise of change
BKOB-3707||Michaela walked and sounded like more of the same
BKOB-3708||McCain and the team must have known they needed to do something dramatic
BKOB-3709||and I have to give them credit they sure did deliver
BKOB-3710||the day after I can mention Michelle and I along with Jill and Joe Biden Ron the campaign plane waiting
BKOB-3711||take off for a few days with best in Pennsylvania when asked rushed up to tell us that word had leaked of McCain's running mate
BKOB-3712||Joe looked at the name on axis blackberry and then turn to me
BKOB-3713||who the hell is Sarah Palin he said for the next two weeks the national press Corps would obsess over that question
BKOB-3714||giving McCain's campaign a much-needed shot of adrenaline and effectively knocking our campaign off the airwaves
BKOB-3715||after adding Palin to the ticket McCain raked in millions of dollars in fresh donations in a single weekend
BKOB-3716||it's called a left up essentially putting us in a dead Heat
BKOB-3717||Sarah Palin a 44 year-old governor of Alaska and an unknown when it came National politics was above all a potent disrupt
BKOB-3718||Not only was she young and a woman a potential groundbreaker in her own right
BKOB-3719||but she also had a store you couldn't makeup she'd been a small-town basketball player and pageant Queen bounced among five.
BKOB-3720||but just before graduating with a journalism degree she's worked for a while as a sportscaster before getting elected mayor of Wasilla Alaska
BKOB-3721||and then taking all the states and trench Republican establishment and beating the incoming governor in 2006
BKOB-3722||he married her high school sweetheart had five kids including a teenage son about to be deployed to Iraq and a baby with Down Syndrome
BKOB-3723||Professor a Conservative Christian faith and enjoyed hunting moose and Elk during your spare time
BKOB-3724||hers was a biography tailor-made for working-class white voters who hated Washington and harbor the not entirely unjustified suspicion the big city Elites weather in business politics or the media look down on their way of life
BKOB-3725||the New York Times editorial board or empty our listeners question her qualifications
BKOB-3726||she offered their criticism as proof of her authenticity
BKOB-3727||understanding far earlier than many of her critics
BKOB-3728||the old Gatekeepers were losing relevance that the walls of what had been considered acceptable in a candidate for national office had been breached
BKOB-3729||and the Fox News Talk Radio and the budding power of social media could provide her with all the platform she needed to reach her intended audience
BKOB-3730||it helped to the Palin was a born performer
BKOB-3731||for 45 minutes Peach the Republican National Convention in early September was a masterpiece of folksy populism and well-aimed zingers
BKOB-3732||in small towns we don't quite know what to make of a candidates who lavished Praise on working people when they're listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and gun when those people aren't listening
BKOB-3733||ouch the delegates were ecstatic
BKOB-3734||Springwood Palin after the convention McCain spoke to crowds three or four times larger than what he normally saw on his own
BKOB-3735||and while the Republican faithful
BKOB-3736||it became clear that it was his hockey mom running mate that they were really there to see
BKOB-3737||she was new different one of them
BKOB-3738||a quote real American and fantastically proud of
BKOB-3739||different time and different place say a swing state senator gubernatorial race
BKOB-3740||the sheer energy Palin generated within the Republican base might have had me worried
BKOB-3741||but from the day McCain shoulder and through the heights of pale and Mania
BKOB-3742||I felt certain that decision would not serve him well
BKOB-3743||are all appealing performative gifts the vice president most important qualification was the ability if necessary to assume the presidency
BKOB-3744||giving John's age and history of melanoma just wasn't an idle concern
BKOB-3745||and what became abundantly clear as soon as Sarah Palin stepped into the spotlight
BKOB-3746||was that on just about every subject relevant to governing the country
BKOB-3747||he had absolutely no idea what the hell she was
BKOB-3748||the financial system the Supreme Court the Russian invasion of Georgia it didn't matter what the topic was or what formed the question
BKOB-3749||the Alaskan governor appeared lost stringing words together like a kid trying to Bluff her way through a test for what she had failed to study
BKOB-3750||pillows nomination was traveling on a deeper level
BKOB-3751||I noticed from the start that are incoherent didn't matter to the vast majority of Republicans
BKOB-3752||in fact anytime she crumbled under questioning by a journalist they seem to view it as proof of a liberal conspiracy
BKOB-3753||I was even more surprised to witness prominent conservatives including those who have spent a year dismissing me as an experience
BKOB-3754||and who spent decades decrying affirmative action the arozin of intellectual standards and the debasement of Western culture at the hands of multiculturalism
BKOB-3755||probably showing for Pella time themselves in knots baseball to convince the public that in a vice
BKOB-3756||the need for basic knowledge of foreign policy or the functions of the federal government was actually overrated
BKOB-3757||Sarah Palin like Reagan had good instincts they say
BKOB-3758||and once installed she grow into the job it was of course the sign of things to come
BKOB-3759||a larger darker reality in which partisan affiliation and political expedience would threaten to block out everything
BKOB-3760||your previous positions your stated principles
BKOB-3761||even while your own senses your eyes and ears told you to be true
BKOB-3762||chapter 9 in 1993 Michelle and I purchased our first home in Hyde Park Condominium complex called Eastview Park
BKOB-3763||it was a lovely location across from Promontory point in Lake Michigan with dogwood trees in the Apple Courtyard Bloom the bright pink every
BKOB-3764||the three-bedroom apartment laid out like a railcar from front to back wasn't large but it had hardwood floors and decent light and a proper dining room with Walnut cabinets
BKOB-3765||compared to the second floor of my mother-in-law's house where we've been living to save money it felt absolutely lavish and we furnished it that our budget allowed with a combination of Crate & Barrel couches Ace Hardware Land and yard sale table
BKOB-3766||next to the kitchen there was a small study where I work in the evenings
BKOB-3767||Michelle called it the whole because the way was always filled with stacks of books magazines newspapers legal briefs I was writing and exams I was great
BKOB-3768||every month or so profit by my inability to find something I needed I clean the whole in an hour-long friends
BKOB-3769||I would feel very proud of myself for the next three days or so it would take for the books and papers another clutter to spring back like weeds
BKOB-3770||the whole was also the only woman the apartment where I smoke
BKOB-3771||but once the girls were born I took my file habit outside for the slightly rickety back porch where I sometimes interrupt families raccoon foraging through our trash can
BKOB-3772||kids reshaped our home and all sorts of ways foam childproofing pads appeared on the table corner
BKOB-3773||the dining room became less about dining and more repository for the playpens in brightly colored Matt found myself stepping on at least once a day
BKOB-3774||instead of feeling France the apartments modifies only amplify the joy and noise of our young family
BKOB-3775||splashy bath times and squeal filled birthday parties in the sound of Motown or salsa coming from a Boombox on the mantle cuz I spun the girls around in my arms
BKOB-3776||I'm only noticed friends R8 buying bigger houses and more well-off neighborhoods the only time the idea of us moving came up was the summer when either one
BKOB-3777||or two we couldn't be sure repeatedly scampered down the long hallway
BKOB-3778||I would fix the problem with repairs to a kitchen floor board but only after with remarkable foolishness and a wise as grin on my face I disputed the notion that two mice really qualified as an infestation
BKOB-3779||Emma Shelton responsive threatened to leave with the girls
BKOB-3780||we paid two hundred and seventy seven thousand and five hundred dollars for the condo with fourty percent down thanks to some help from Two and a 30-year fixed mortgage
BKOB-3781||on paper our income should have comfortably supported our monthly payments
BKOB-3782||what is Malia and Sasha got older the cost of childcare school fees and summer camps kept Rising while the principal
BKOB-3783||money was perpetually type-r credit card balances grow
BKOB-3784||we have little in the way of saving suggested we consider refinancing armoire
BKOB-3785||sister take advantage of lower interest rates I made a call the next day to a neighborhood mortgage broker
BKOB-3786||the broker an energetic young man with a buzz cut confirmed we could save a hundred bucks or so a month by refinance
BKOB-3787||would home prices going through the roof he asked if we considered also using a portion of our Equity to get some cash out of the transaction
BKOB-3788||it was just a matter of working with his appraiser
BKOB-3789||I was skeptical at first hearing to sensible voice ringing in my ears
BKOB-3790||but when I ran the numbers and considered what would say by paying off our credit card.
BKOB-3791||Brokers logic was hard to dispute with neither the appraiser nor the broker even bothering to inspect our house
BKOB-3792||with me providing only 3 months of pay stubs and a handful of bank statements
BKOB-3793||I signed a few papers and walked out of broker's office with a fourty thousand dollar check and a vague feeling but I've gotten away with something
BKOB-3794||that's how I wasn't nearly 2,000 a real estate Gold Rush
BKOB-3795||Chicago new developments seem to pop up overnight
BKOB-3796||we don't prices climbing at an unprecedented Pace with interest rates low when someone is requiring just ten or 5 percent or even no money down for a purchase
BKOB-3797||why pass up the extra bedroom the granite countertops and the finished basement that magazines and television shows insisted work standard measures of a middle-class life
BKOB-3798||it was a great investment a sure thing and once purchased that same home could serve as your personal ATM
BKOB-3799||covering the right window treatments that long desired Cancun vacation or making up for the fact that you didn't get a raise last year
BKOB-3800||eager to get in on the action friends cab drivers and schoolteachers told me they started flipping houses everyone suddenly fluent in the language of balloon payments adjustable rate mortgages and the case-shiller index
BKOB-3801||if I cost them gently real estate can be unpredictable you don't want to get in too deep
BKOB-3802||latest shormi that talk to their cousin or Uncle who had made a killing in a ton of mild Amusement been applied I didn't know the score
BKOB-3803||after I was elected to the US Senate we sold our Eastview Park condo and price high enough to cover a mortgage and home equity loan and made a small prop
BKOB-3804||but I noticed driving home one night that my mortgage brokers storefront was no answer
BKOB-3805||the big for sale or Lease sign in the window all those new condos in River North and South Loop appeared unoccupied
BKOB-3806||even with developers offering buyers deeper and deeper discounts
BKOB-3807||former staffer who'd left government to get her real estate license asked if I knew of any job openings
BKOB-3808||the new gig wasn't handing out if she talked I was neither surprised nor alarm by any of this figuring it was just the cyclical ebenflow in the market
BKOB-3809||the back Indies I happen to mention the softening Chicago real estate market to a friend of mine George Haywood while we were eating sandwiches in the park near the capitol
BKOB-3810||Georgia dropped out of Harvard Law to play professional blackjack
BKOB-3811||berlanga skill with numbers and tolerance for risk into a job as a Wall Street Bond Trader
BKOB-3812||and ultimately made a mint on personal Investments
BKOB-3813||being head of the curve with his business this is just the start he told me
BKOB-3814||what do you mean I mean the entire housing market George said
BKOB-3815||entire Financial system it's all House of Cards waiting to top
BKOB-3816||as we sat in the afternoon son he gave me a quick tutorial on the burgeoning subprime-mortgage mark
BKOB-3817||where's banks that wants typically held the mortgage loans they made in their own portfolio
BKOB-3818||a huge percentage of mortgages were not bundled and sold as Securities on Wall Street
BKOB-3819||Banks Caddell off loader if the any particular borrow my defaults on their lungs
BKOB-3820||Richard ization of mortgages that led Banks to steadily loosen their lending standards
BKOB-3821||credit rating agencies paid by the insurance Securities as AAA or least risky
BKOB-3822||without adequately analyzing the default risk on the underlying mortgages
BKOB-3823||Global Investors Awash in cash and eager for higher-return rushed in to buy these products pumping more money into Housing Finance
BKOB-3824||meanwhile Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the two giant companies the Congress had authorized to purchase qualified mortgages to encourage home ownership
BKOB-3825||and which by virtue of their quasi-governmental status could borrow money much more cheaply than other companies
BKOB-3826||we're knee-deep in the subprime market with their shareholders making money hand-over-fist is the housing market swell
BKOB-3827||all of this had contributed to a classic bubble George set
BKOB-3828||long as housing prices kept going up everybody was happy
BKOB-3829||the family who could stop me by the dream house with no money down
BKOB-3830||the developer who couldn't build houses fast enough to satisfy all these new customers
BKOB-3831||the bank that's old increasingly complex financial instruments that handsome profits
BKOB-3832||the hedge funds and investment banks are replacing bigger bigger bets on these financial instruments with borrowed money
BKOB-3833||not to mention Furniture retailers carpet manufacturers trade unions and newspaper advertising departments all of which had every incentive to keep the party going
BKOB-3834||but with so many I'm qualified buyers propping up the market
BKOB-3835||George was convinced the party would eventually end
BKOB-3836||what I was noticing in Chicago was just a Tremor he told me
BKOB-3837||once the earthquake game the impact would be far worse in places like Florida Arizona and Nevada where subprime lending had been most active
BKOB-3838||as soon as large numbers of homeowners started default
BKOB-3839||investors would realize that a lot of mortgage-backed Securities weren't
BKOB-3840||AAA after all they'd likely rush for the exits dumping the Securities as fast as they could
BKOB-3841||Banks Securities would be vulnerable for once
BKOB-3842||and would probably pull back on lending to cover losses or maintain Capital requirements
BKOB-3843||making it hard for even qualified families to get a mortgage which in turn would depress the housing market even further
BKOB-3844||it would be a vicious cycle likely to trigger a market panic
BKOB-3845||and because of the sheer amount of money involved the result could be an economic crisis the likes of which we hadn't seen in our lifetime
BKOB-3846||I listened all this with growing incredulity George was not prone to exaggeration especially when it came to money
BKOB-3847||he told me he is taking a hefty short position himself
BKOB-3848||especially betting that the price of mortgage-backed Securities will go way down in the future
BKOB-3849||I have to why it was but if the risk of a full-blown crisis was so high no one not the Federal Reserve
BKOB-3850||or Bank Regulators or the financial press seem to be talkin about
BKOB-3852||when I got back to my setting office I asked them my staff to check with their counterparts in the Banking Committee to see if anyone saw any danger in the spiking of the subprime mortgage Market
BKOB-3853||reports came back negative but Federal Reserve chairman indicated that the housing market was a bit overheated and do for an eventual correct
BKOB-3854||but the given historical Trends he saw no major threat to the financial system or the broader economy
BKOB-3855||with all the other issues on my plate including the start of the midterm campaign
BKOB-3856||Georgia's warning receded from my mind in fact when I saw a couple months later than early 2007
BKOB-3857||both the financial and housing markets has continued to soften but it didn't seem to be anything serious
BKOB-3858||George told me that he had been forced to abandon his short position after taking heavy losses
BKOB-3859||I just don't have enough cash to stay with the bat he said calmly enough
BKOB-3860||batting apparently I've underestimated how willing people are to maintain the charade
BKOB-3861||I didn't ask George how much money is lost and we moved on to other topics
BKOB-3862||we parted ways that day not knowing the charade wouldn't last very much longer
BKOB-3863||or the turbo Fallout would just a year-and-a-half later play critical role in electing me present
BKOB-3864||Senator Obama this is Hank Paulson it was a week and a half after the Republican National Convention 11 days before my first schedule debate with John McCain
BKOB-3865||it was Clearwater US Treasury secretary had requested the call
BKOB-3866||the financial system wasn't emailed them and taking the American economy with
BKOB-3867||adore Rock have been the biggest issue at the start of a campaign I'd always made the need for more Progressive economic policies a central part of my argument for change
BKOB-3868||if I thought the combination of globalization and rebel
BKOB-3869||very new technologies have been fundamentally altering the American economy for at least two decades
BKOB-3870||us manufacturers since shifted production overseas taking advantage of low-cost labor and shipping back cheap Goods to be sold by big-box retailers against which small businesses couldn't hope to compete
BKOB-3871||entire categories of office work and in some cases whole industry
BKOB-3873||but for ordinary workers Capital mobility and automation meant a never weakening bargaining position
BKOB-3874||manufacturing towns lost their lifeblood low inflation and cheap flat screen TVs
BKOB-3875||compensate for layoffs fewer hours in temp work stagnant wages and reduce benefits especially when both Healthcare and education costs to sectors less subject to call saving automation kept story
BKOB-3876||in a quality also had a way of compounding itself
BKOB-3877||even middle-class Americans found themselves increasingly priced out of neighborhoods with the best schools or cities with the best job prospects
BKOB-3878||they were unable to afford the extras SAT prep courses computer camps invaluable but unpaid internships the better-off parents routinely provided their kids
BKOB-3879||by 2007 the American economy was not only producing greater inequality than almost every other wealthy Nation but also delivering less upward Mobility
BKOB-3880||I believed that these outcomes were not in a
BKOB-3881||but rather were the result of political choices dating back to Ronald Reagan
BKOB-3882||under the banner of economic freedom
BKOB-3883||an ownership Society was the first President Bush years
BKOB-3884||Americans have been fed a steady diet of tax cuts for the wealthy and steam collective-bargaining laws go on in 4th
BKOB-3885||there been efforts to privatize or cut the social safety net
BKOB-3886||Federal budgets have consistently underinvested in everything from early childhood education to infrastructure
BKOB-3887||all this further accelerated then equality leaving families ill-equipped to navigate even minor economic turbulence
BKOB-3888||I was campaigning to push the country in the opposite direction
BKOB-3889||I didn't think America could roll back automation or sever the global supply chain although I did think we can negotiate stronger labor and environmental Provisions in our trade agreements
BKOB-3890||but I was certain we could adapt our laws and institutions just as we've done in the past to make sure that folks willing to work could get a fair Shake
BKOB-3891||at every stop by Maiden every city and small town my message was the same
BKOB-3892||I promise to raise taxes on high-income American to pay for Vital investments in education research and infrastructure
BKOB-3893||I promise to strengthen unions and raise the minimum wage as well as to deliver universal healthcare and make College more for
BKOB-3894||I wanted people to understand but there was a precedent for bold government action
BKOB-3895||FDR had stayed capitalism from itself laying the foundation for a post World War 2 boom
BKOB-3896||talked about how strong labor laws and help build a thriving middle class and a thriving domestic Market
BKOB-3897||and how am I driving out on fake products and fraudulent schemes consumer protection laws had actually helped legitimate businesses prosper and grow
BKOB-3898||explain how strong public schools and state universities and a GI Bill and unleash the potential of generations of Americans and driven upward Mobility
BKOB-3899||programs like Social Security and Medicare and given those same
BKOB-3900||Perkins a measure of stability in their golden years and government Investments like those in the Tennessee Valley Authority and the interstate highway system and boosted productivity and provided the platform for countless entrepreneur
BKOB-3901||I was convinced we could adapt these strategies to current time
BKOB-3902||Beyond any specific policy I wanted to restore in the minds of the American people The crucial role that government had always played in expanding opportunity fostering competition and fair dealing and making sure the marketplace work for everybody
BKOB-3903||what I hadn't counted on was a major financial crisis
BKOB-3904||despite my friend George's early-warning it hadn't been until the spring of 2007 that I start noticing troubling headlines in the financial press
BKOB-3905||the nation's second-largest subprime lender New Century Financial declare bankruptcy after surgeon mortgage defaults

BKOB-3908||this man put me ahead of the curve compared to the other presidential candidates
BKOB-3909||but nonetheless well behind the pace at which events on Wall Street or beginning to spin out of control
BKOB-3910||in the months that followed financial markets saw a flight to safety as lenders and investors moved their money into government back treasury but sharply was printed credit and yang Capital out of any firm that might have significant risk when it came to mortgage-backed securities

BKOB-3918||would face a similar Reckoning for the public it was tempting to see all this as a righteous comeuppance for greedy bankers and hedge-fund managers

BKOB-3922||Smogon entitled conspicuous in their consumption and indifferent to the impact their decisions might have on everyone else
BKOB-3923||the problem was that in the midst of a financial panic in a modern capitalist economy

BKOB-3925||like it or not everybody and everything was connect
BKOB-3926||by Spring the United States had entered a full-blown recession

BKOB-3928||but with the Falls now spiking credit tightening the stock market declining and housing prices plummet
BKOB-3929||businesses large and small decided to retrench
BKOB-3930||they laid off workers and cancelled orders they deferred investment in new plants and it systems
BKOB-3931||and if people would work for those companies lost their jobs or saw the equity in their homes or 401K plans dwindle or fell behind on their credit card payments and were forced to spend down their savings they to retrench
BKOB-3932||they put off new car purchases stopped eating out and postpone vacation
BKOB-3933||and with declining sales businesses cut payrolls in spending even more

BKOB-3953||that morning Monday September 15th Lehman Brothers a 639 billion dollar company had announced it was filing for bankruptcy
BKOB-3954||the fact of the Treasury Department had not intervened to prevent
BKOB-3955||what would be the largest bankruptcy filing in history
BKOB-3956||signaled that we were entering a new phase in the crisis
BKOB-3957||we can expect a very bad Market reaction he said
BKOB-3958||the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better
BKOB-3959||Explain why both Treasury and the fed and determine Lehman was too weak to prop up
BKOB-3960||and that no other financial institution with one to take on its liabilities
BKOB-3961||President Bush it authorized Paulson brief both me and John McCain because further emergency action would need bipartisan political support
BKOB-3962||Boston hope that both campaigns would respect and respond appropriately to the severity of the situation
BKOB-3963||you didn't need a pollster to know the person was right to be worried about the politics
BKOB-3964||we were seven weeks from a national election as the public learned more about the enormity of the crisis
BKOB-3965||the idea of spending billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out Reckless Banks would surely rank in popularity somewhere between
BKOB-3966||bad case of the shingles and Osama bin Laden
BKOB-3967||the following day Paulson treasury would prevent catastrophes at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by redefining both institutions in a way that allowed them to create commercial Banks eligible for federal protection
BKOB-3968||spell even blue-chip companies with Sterling ratings were suddenly unable to borrow the money they needed to finance day-to-day operations and money-market funds previously considered as safe and liquid as cash we're now starting to buckle
BKOB-3969||for Democrats it would be easy enough to lay the blame for the Fiasco at the foot of the administration
BKOB-3970||but the truth was that plenty of congressional Democrats and applauded Rising homeownership rates through the subprime Boom
BKOB-3971||Republicans who are up for re-election and already saddled with an unpopular president and a tanking economy
BKOB-3972||the prospect of voting for more Wall Street bailouts look like an invitation to dig their own Graves
BKOB-3973||if you need to take further steps I told Boston I'm guessing your biggest problem will come from your side not mine
BKOB-3974||already met Republican administrations interventions in the banking sector violated the core conservative principles of limited government
BKOB-3975||accuse the Federal Reserve of overstepping its mandate
BKOB-3976||and some had the gall to criticize government Regulators for failing to catch the problem in the subprime market sooner they themselves have spent the past eight years working the weekend every Financial regulation they can find
BKOB-3977||John McCain public comments up to that point had been muted then I heard Paulson to keep in close contact with my competitor as the situation develops
BKOB-3978||is the Republican nominee McCain didn't have the luxury of distancing himself from Bush
BKOB-3979||is bouta continue most of Bush's economic policies in fact it always been one of his greatest vulnerability
BKOB-3980||during the primaries he confessed he didn't know much about economic policy
BKOB-3981||more recently reinforced the impression that he was out of touch by miniature reporter that he wasn't sure how many homes he owned
BKOB-3982||the answer was eight based on what Austin was telling me became filetico problems were about to get worse
BKOB-3983||I've no doubt his political advisers would urge him to improve his standing with voters by distancing himself from any Financial rescue efforts did ministration tried to make
BKOB-3984||if McCain chose not to be supportive I knew I'd be under Fierce pressure from Democrats and perhaps my own staff to follow suit
BKOB-3985||and yet cuz I wrapped up a conversation with Paulson
BKOB-3986||I knew that it didn't matter what McCain dip with the stakes this high I would do whatever was necessary regardless of the politics to help me Administration stabilize the situation
BKOB-3987||I wanted to be president I told myself I needed to act like one
BKOB-3988||have expected John McCain had difficulty coming up with a coherent response to the rap
BKOB-3989||unfolding events on the day of the announcement in an ill-timed attempt to reassure the public she appeared to the televised rally and declare the quote the fundamentals of the economy are strong
BKOB-3990||my campaign absolutely roasted important Senator what economy are you talking about I asked
BKOB-3991||speaking later in the day at a rally of my own in the ensuing days the news of Lehman's bankruptcy sent financial markets into a full-blown pad
BKOB-3992||stocks plunged Merrill Lynch had already negotiated desperation sale to Bank of America
BKOB-3994||AIG with the poster child for quote too-big-to-fail sew in
BKOB-3995||Global Financial networks that its collapse would cause a Cascade of bank failures
BKOB-3996||and even after the government intervened it continued to hammer
BKOB-3998||establishing a new emergency fund of 700 billion dollars
BKOB-3999||that was the price they estimated to Stave off Armageddon
BKOB-4000||perhaps to compensate for his earlier blunder McCain announced his opposition to the government bailout of AIG
BKOB-4001||a day later he reversed himself his position on tarp remains unclear opposing bailouts in theory but maybe supporting this one in practice
BKOB-4002||without getting and zagging our campaign had no problem time of Crisis to a bush McCain economic agenda the prioritize the wealthy and Powerful over the middle-class arguing that McCain was unprepared to steer the country through tough Economic Times
BKOB-4003||nevertheless I did my best to stay true to the commitment I made the pulse
BKOB-4004||instructing my team to refrain from making public comments that might jeopardize the Bush Administration chances of getting Congress to approve a rescue package
BKOB-4005||along with our in-house Beacon Ahmad visors austan goolsbee and Jason Furman I've begun Consulting with an ad hoc Advisory Group that included former Federal Reserve chairman Paul volcker
BKOB-4006||Harlequin treasury secretary Larry Summers and legendary investor Warren Buffett
BKOB-4007||all hit live through major financial crisis before and he's confirmed for this one was of a different order of magnitude
BKOB-4008||without Swift action they told me we Face the very real possibility of economic collapse
BKOB-4009||Millions more Americans losing their homes and their life savings along with depression-era levels of unemployment
BKOB-4010||the briefings proved invaluable in helping me understand the nuts and bolts of the crisis and evaluate the various responses being proposed
BKOB-4011||they also scared the heck out of me by the time I travel to Tampa
BKOB-4012||where I'd be preparing for my first debate with McKay
BKOB-4013||I felt confident that on the substance of the economy at least
BKOB-4014||I knew what I was talking about and I increasingly dreaded what a prolonged crisis might mean for families all across America
BKOB-4015||even without the distraction of looming crisis I probably would have looked forward to being holed up in a hotel for three days of debate prep
BKOB-4016||but given my inconsistency during the primary debates I knew I needed to work
BKOB-4017||fortunately our team recruited a pair of lawyers and political veterans Ron klain and Tom donnellan would served in
BKOB-4018||prepping candidates like Al Gore Bill Clinton and John Kerry
BKOB-4019||the moment I arrived they gave me a detailed breakdown of the debate format and an outline of every conceivable question that might be at
BKOB-4020||along with ax + Communications advisor needed done and the rest of the team they drilled me for hours on the precise answers they wanted to hear
BKOB-4021||down for the last word or turn of phrase in the old Biltmore Hotel where we had set up shop Ron and Tom had insisted on building an exact replica of the debate stage
BKOB-4022||that first night they subjected me to a full 90-minute mock debate
BKOB-4023||taking apart every aspect my performance from taste to posture Tutone
BKOB-4024||it was exhausting but undeniably used
BKOB-4025||by the time my head hit the pillow I was certain I would be dreaming in talking points
BKOB-4026||despite their best efforts though news from outside the claim donnellan bubble kept diverting my attention
BKOB-4027||in between sessions I got updates on Market developments and on the prospects for the administration tarp legislation
BKOB-4029||with the press and the public howling at the price tag and representatives from both sides of the aisle balking at the lack of detail
BKOB-4030||Pietro's told me the administration wasn't even close to having the most needed for Passage
BKOB-4031||Harry Reid and house Speaker Nancy Pelosi affirm this when I spoke to the my phone
BKOB-4032||both were hard-nosed politicians not averse to bashing Republicans in order to solidify their majorities when the opportunity arose
BKOB-4033||but if I would see repeatedly over the next few years
BKOB-4034||both Harry and Matthew were willing sometimes after a whole lot of grouting to set politics aside when issue of vital importance was a steak
BKOB-4035||they were looking to me for direction I shared my honest assessment
BKOB-4036||with some conditions attached and sure it wasn't just the Wall Street giveaway
BKOB-4037||Democrats needed to help get it passed and to their credit the 2L said they'd managed to drag in their respective caucuses and provide votes for passage if Bush and GOP leaders delivered sufficient Republican votes as well
BKOB-4038||I knew that was a hell of a big are unpopular legislation and election fast approaching and neither side wanting to hand ammunition to the other it seems a Surefire recipe for gridlock
BKOB-4039||to break the impasse I started seriously considering a quixotic idea proposed by my friend Tom Coburn the Republican senator from Oklahoma
BKOB-4040||the McKinley I put out a joint statement advocating the Congress pass some
BKOB-4041||if both of us played our hands on the bloody knife Coburn reason
BKOB-4042||we could take the politics out of the vote and allow a nervous Congress to make a reasonable decision without obsessing over its election day impact
BKOB-4043||I had no idea how McCain would respond to this
BKOB-4044||they could come off as gimmicky but knowing that unless a rescue Package cast
BKOB-4045||we'd be looking at what could turn into a full-blown depression I figured it was worth a shot
BKOB-4046||McCain live spoke by phone as I wrote back to my hotel after a short campaign of a
BKOB-4047||his voice was soft polite precautious
BKOB-4048||he was open to a possible joint statement he said
BKOB-4049||but had been mulling over a different idea how about if we both suspended our campaigns
BKOB-4050||what if we postponed the debate headed back to Washington and waited until the rescue package pass
BKOB-4051||I couldn't imagine how bringing the presidential campaign circus to watch
BKOB-4052||would be in any way helpful I was encouraged by McCain's apparent interest in Rising above the day-to-day scrum and getting a bill passed
BKOB-4053||careful not to sound dismissive I suggested and John agreed that our campaign managers work up a range of options for our consideration and then we check back in with each other in an hour or two
BKOB-4054||that's progress I thought hanging up and then dial place and instructed them to call Rick Davis McCain's campaign manager to follow up
BKOB-4055||minutes later I arrived at the hotel and found Pluff scowling having just hung up with Davis
BKOB-4056||McClain's about to hold press conference he said announcing his plan is suspended campaign and fly back to Washington
BKOB-4057||what I talked to him ten minutes ago
BKOB-4058||yeah well it wasn't on the level Davis McCain won't even show at the debate unless the rescue package gets done in the next 72 hours
BKOB-4059||he says McCain's going to publicly call on you to join him in suspending campaigning sense get this Senator McCain thinks politics should take a backseat right now
BKOB-4060||sped up the words looking like 12 hit somebody
BKOB-4061||a few minutes later we watched McCain make his announcement his voice dripping with concern
BKOB-4062||it was hard not to feel both angry and disappointed
BKOB-4063||the charitable view was the John reacted out of mistrust afraid that my suggestion of a joint statement was an attempt to one-up him he decided to one-up me first
BKOB-4064||Electro edible view shared unanimously by my staff was that a desperate campaign was embarking on yet another poorly thought-out political stunt
BKOB-4065||stunt or not a whole passel of Washington political insiders considered McCain's move a masterstroke
BKOB-4066||as soon as he was off the air we were bombarded with anxious messages from democratic consultant and Beltway supporters saying we needed to suspend the camp
BKOB-4067||or risk feeding The High Ground at a moment of National Emergency
BKOB-4068||but by both temperament and experience we weren't inclined to follow the conventional with
BKOB-4069||not only did I think that the two of us posturing and Washington would lessen rather than improve the chances of getting tar pass
BKOB-4070||I felt that the financial crisis made it that much more important for the debate to take place
BKOB-4071||The Boulders could hear directly from the two men buying to lead them through uncharted waters
BKOB-4072||still projecting McCain's call felt like a huge Gamble
BKOB-4073||but my team gathered around me I asked if anyone disagreed with my assessment
BKOB-4074||without hesitation they all said no I smile
BKOB-4075||okay then an hour and a half later I helped my own press conference to say I would not be suspending my campaign
BKOB-4076||I pointed out that I was already in regular consultation with Paulson and Congressional leaders and then I was available to fly to Washington and Ramona
BKOB-4077||notice if needed I been at lived aligned that would dominate the news coverage
BKOB-4078||presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time
BKOB-4079||we have no idea how voters would respond but we all felt pretty good about my decision
BKOB-4080||sat down to start gaming out next step though
BKOB-4081||pumpkin email from Josh Bolton Bush's Chief of Staff asking the recall
BKOB-4082||he darted out of the room when he returned a few minutes later if brown head beeping
BKOB-4083||apparently mikenas Bush to host a meeting tomorrow at the White House with you McCain and the Congressional leaders to try to hash out an agreement on tar
BKOB-4084||what should be calling you any minute to invite you to the festivities
BKOB-4085||Foster Gazette this is absolutely bulshit he said
BKOB-4086||although it's not large the cabinet room of the White House's stately with a rich red carpet adorned with gold stars and cream-colored
BKOB-4087||balls with eagle shape sconces on the north side of the room marble busts of Washington and Franklin
BKOB-4088||sculpted in the classical style gave out from ducks on either side of a fireplace
BKOB-4089||at the center of the room sits an oval table made of gleaming mahogany
BKOB-4090||and surrounded by 20 heavy leather chairs
BKOB-4091||small breastplate affixed to the back of each one signifying where the president vice president and various cabinet membership
BKOB-4092||place for sober deliberation built to accommodate the weight of History
BKOB-4093||on most days like streams into the room through broad French doors that look out onto the Rose Garden
BKOB-4094||but on September 25th as I took my seat for the meeting worship called at McCain's Bahasa
BKOB-4095||sky was overcast around the tables that the president vice president Cheney McCain and me along with Hank Paulson Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid the Republican
BKOB-4096||John Boehner and Mitch McConnell plus the chairpersons from ranking members the relevant committees
BKOB-4097||Ford White House and Congressional staffers line the walls taking notes and leaving through thick briefing books
BKOB-4098||no one look like they want to be there the president certainly hadn't found it enthusiastically we spoken on the phone to previous day
BKOB-4099||I just agreed with just about every one of George W Bush's major policy decisions but I'd come to like the man finding him to be straightforward disarming and self-deprecating in this humor
BKOB-4100||I Can't Tell You Why McCain thinks this is a good idea he said sounding almost apologetic
BKOB-4101||acknowledge that Hank Paulson and I were already communicating a couple of times daily and expressed appreciation for my behind-the-scenes help with Congressional Democrats
BKOB-4102||if I were you watching the last place I'd want to be
BKOB-4103||but McCain asked and I can't say no
BKOB-4104||hopefully we can keep it short only later
BKOB-4105||learn the Paulson and the rest of Bush's team had been opposed to the meeting and for good reason
BKOB-4106||over the previous several days Congressional leaders had begun to narrow their differences on the tarp legislation
BKOB-4107||that very morning there been reports of a tentative agreement although within a few hours House Republicans pulled back from a
BKOB-4108||with negotiations at such a delicate stage wishes advisors rightly felted inserting me and McCain in the process would likely hinder more than help
BKOB-4109||Bush bowhead overrule this team and I couldn't blame
BKOB-4110||given the increasing resistance to tarp within his own party
BKOB-4111||he could hardly afford to have the Republican nominee go south on
BKOB-4112||fill the entire proceeding had the air of an elaborate charade
BKOB-4113||looking at the dower faces around the room I understood we were gathered not for a substantiv negotiation but rather a presidential effort to placate one-man
BKOB-4114||the president opened with a brief appeal for Unity before
BKOB-4115||the meeting over to Paulson who updated current market conditions and explain how tarp funds would be used to buy a Bad Mortgages toxic assets as they were called from the bank's thereby showing up balance sheets and restoring Market confidence
BKOB-4116||Hank and Ben think this plan is going to work Bush that after their finish
BKOB-4117||then that's what I'm for in accordance with protocol the president next called on speaker plug
BKOB-4118||rather than take the floor herself though Nancy politely informed the president that the Democrats would have me speak first on their behalf
BKOB-4119||it had been Harriet Nancy's idea that I serve as our Point person and I was grateful for
BKOB-4120||not only did it ensure that I wouldn't be outflanked by McCain during the deliberation
BKOB-4121||but it's signal to my fellow Democrats saw their political fortunes is wrapped up with mine
BKOB-4122||the move seemed to catch the Republicans by surprise and I couldn't help noticing the president give Nancy wanted to tablets merch
BKOB-4123||shrewd politician he recognized death maneuver when he saw one before not in my way
BKOB-4124||spoke about the nature of the crisis the details be emerging legislation and the remaining points on oversight executive compensation and homeowner relief the Democrats believe still needed to be addressed
BKOB-4125||noting the most Senator McCain and I have publicly pledged not to play politics with the financial rescue app
BKOB-4126||I told the president the Democrats would deliver their share of the votes needed for Passage
BKOB-4127||but I warned that if there was any truth to reports that some Republican leaders were backing away and insisting on starting from scratch with a whole new plan it would inevitably bog down negotiations and the consequences would be severe
BKOB-4128||moisture under McCain and said John says broadcast Chesapeake I think it's only fair that I let you go next
BKOB-4129||everyone looked at McCain whose jaw Titan
BKOB-4130||he appeared to be on the verge of saying something thought better of it
BKOB-4131||and briefly fidgeted in his chair I think I'll just wait for my turn she said final
BKOB-4132||there are moments in an election battle as in wife
BKOB-4133||when all the possible Pathways save one or suddenly closed
BKOB-4134||when what felt like a wide distribution of probable outcomes Narrows to the NFL
BKOB-4135||this was one of those moments were selected McCain with a raised eyebrow
BKOB-4136||shrug and called on John Boehner Boehner said he wasn't talking about starting from scratch but just wanted some modification
BKOB-4137||including a plan he had trouble describing which involved the federal government and Shrink Banks losses rather than purchasing their assets
BKOB-4138||I have pulsing if you'd looked at this Republican insurance proposal and determine whether it would work
BKOB-4139||awesome said firmly that he had and it would
BKOB-4140||Richard Shelby the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee
BKOB-4141||elected to say she's been told by a number of Economist the tarp with work he suggested that the White House give Congress more time to consider all its options
BKOB-4142||what kind of offense that the country didn't have more time
BKOB-4143||at the discussion war on it became increasingly apparent that none of the Republican leaders were familiar with the actual contents of the latest version of the tarp legislation or for that matter the nature of their own proposed changes
BKOB-4144||they were simply trying to find a way to avoid taking a tough vote
BKOB-4145||after listening to several minutes wrangling back-and-forth
BKOB-4146||I jumped in again mr. president I said I'd still like to hear what Senator McCain has to say
BKOB-4147||once again everyone turned to McCain this time he started a small note card in his hand
BKOB-4148||muttered something I couldn't make out and then served up maybe two or three minutes of bromides about how talk seem to be making progress how it was important to give Boehner Room to Move It caucus dies
BKOB-4149||and that was it no plan
BKOB-4150||no strategy not even a smidgen of a suggestion as to how the different positions might be bridged
BKOB-4151||the room felt silent McCain step down as no card his eyes downcast
BKOB-4152||like a batter who knows he's just with that the play
BKOB-4153||I almost felt sorry for him for his team to have encouraged such a high-stakes move and then Center candidate into the meeting unprepared was political malpractice
BKOB-4154||when reporters got wind of his performance that day the coverage would not be kind
BKOB-4155||the more immediate effect of John's weirdness low with the set off a cabinet room 340
BKOB-4156||Nancy and Spencer bachus the ranking Republican on the house Financial Services committee started arguing over who deserve credit for the stronger attack their Protections in the most recent version of the legislation
BKOB-4157||Barney Frank the top and quick-witted Democrat from Massachusetts
BKOB-4158||it stopped and it probably worked harder than anyone to help Paulsen get tarp across the Finish Line started taunting the Republicans yelling repeatedly what's your plan what's your plan
BKOB-4159||faces weather voices Rose people talk over one another
BKOB-4160||and all the while McCain remain silent
BKOB-4161||it got so bad that finally President Bush Road twists
BKOB-4162||I'm obviously lost control this meeting he said we're finished
BKOB-4163||with that he wheeled around and charged out the South.
BKOB-4164||the entire scene left me stunned as McCain and the Republican leadership quickly filed out of the room
BKOB-4165||I told Nancy Harry and the rest of the Democrats into a huddle in the adjacent Roosevelt room
BKOB-4166||they were in various states of vegetation and because we already decided I wouldn't be getting any post-meeting comments to reporters
BKOB-4167||I want to make sure that none of them said anything that might make matters worse
BKOB-4168||we were discussing ways that they could constructively summarize the meeting went alternator
BKOB-4169||looking absolutely shell-shocked away as if he were an unpopular kid on the playground
BKOB-4170||a few even jeered Nancy Balsam said powering next to the speaker
BKOB-4171||please and then in an inspired and so much bad blend of Schumer in desperation he lowered his six-foot-five sixty-two-year-old frame onto one knee
BKOB-4172||I'm begging you don't blow this up the speaker allowed a quick smile
BKOB-4173||Hank I didn't know you were catholic she said
BKOB-4174||Justice quickly her smile evaporated and she had it currently
BKOB-4175||you may not have noticed but we're not the ones trying to blow things up
BKOB-4176||how to get pulse from credit getting back to his feet he stood there for several more minutes and let the Democrats been
BKOB-4177||by the time a accident forpress availability everybody calm down and agreed to try to put the best spin they put on the meat
BKOB-4178||and can I make plans to talk later that night after leaving the White House I put in a call to Plus
BKOB-4179||how to go I thought for Mom
BKOB-4180||it went fine for us I said based on what I just saw we better win this thing or the country is screwed
BKOB-4181||I'm not by Nature a superstitious person as a kid I didn't have a lucky number or on the rabbits
BKOB-4182||I don't believe in ghosts or leprechauns and well I might have made a wish when blowing out birthday candles or tossing a penny into a fountain
BKOB-4183||my mother is always been quick to remind me that there's a direct link between doing your work and having your wishes come true
BKOB-4184||over the course of the campaign though I found myself making a few concessions to the spirit world
BKOB-4185||one day in Iowa for instance a Burly bearded guy and buy
BKOB-4186||covered with tattoos up to me after an event and shove something in my hand
BKOB-4187||it was his lucky metal poker chip explain
BKOB-4188||never fail them in Vegas he wanted me to have
BKOB-4189||a few weeks later the young blind girl in New Hampshire reached out to give me a small heart made of pink glass
BKOB-4190||in Ohio it was a silver cross from a nun with a irrepressible smile in the face is grooved as a peach pit
BKOB-4191||assortment of charms grew steadily a miniature Buddha
BKOB-4192||Ohio buckeye a laminated four leaf clover
BKOB-4193||honey bronze likeness of Hanuman the monkey god
BKOB-4194||all manner of angels rosary beads crystals and rocks
BKOB-4195||each morning I made a habit of choosing five or six of them and putting them in my pocket
BKOB-4196||have consciously keeping track which ones I had with me on a particularly good day
BKOB-4197||if my cash small Treasures then guarantee that the universe
BKOB-4198||Hilton my favor I figured they didn't hurt
BKOB-4199||I felt comforted anytime I turn them over in my hand or felt their light jangling as I moved from event to event
BKOB-4200||each charm was a tactile reminder of all the people I've met
BKOB-4201||the faint but steady transmission of their hopes and expectations
BKOB-4202||I also became particular by my debate day rituals
BKOB-4203||good morning was always devoted to going over strategy and keep points the early afternoon to some light campaign
BKOB-4204||I wanted to schedule clear
BKOB-4205||to shed excess adrenaline I get in a quick workout
BKOB-4206||been 90 minutes before heading to the venue I'd shave and take a long hot shower
BKOB-4207||before putting on the new shirt white and tie the war read The Wretched hung in the hotel closet beside my freshly pressed blue suit
BKOB-4208||for dinner comfort food steak cooked medium well
BKOB-4209||roasted or mashed potatoes steamed broccoli
BKOB-4210||a half hour or so ahead of the debate my glancing at my notes
BKOB-4211||I'd listen to music delivered through earbuds are a small portable speaker
BKOB-4212||eventually I became a tad compulsive about hearing certain songs
BKOB-4213||first it was a handful of jazz Classics Miles Davis is Freddie freeloader
BKOB-4214||John Coltrane My Favorite Things Frank Sinatra Luck Be A Lady
BKOB-4215||41 primary debate I must have played that last track two or three times in a row clearly indicating a lack of confidence in my preparation
BKOB-4216||ultimately it was wrapped but got my head in the right place
BKOB-4217||two songs especially Jay-Z my first song and Eminem Lose Yourself
BKOB-4218||both were about Define the odds and putting it all on the line
BKOB-4219||look if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment would you capture
BKOB-4220||or just let it slip out spell to spend something out of nothing
BKOB-4221||getting by on wet fossil and fear disguises bravado
BKOB-4222||the lyrics tell Taylor to my early Underdog status
BKOB-4223||as I sat alone in the back of the Secret Service man on the way to a debate side
BKOB-4224||and my crisp uniform and dimpled pie-eyed not my head to the beat of those songs feeling with the private Rebellion
BKOB-4225||a connection to something greater and more real than all the fussing deference that messed around with me
BKOB-4226||it was way to cut through the artifice and remember who I was
BKOB-4227||before my first debate with John McCain in late September my follow the ritual to a T
BKOB-4228||I ate my steak listen to my music
BKOB-4229||the weight of the charms in my pocket cuz I walked onto the stage
BKOB-4230||frankly I didn't mean a lot a lot
BKOB-4231||by the time I arrived on the campus of the University of Mississippi
BKOB-4232||place where less than fifty years earlier a black man named James Meredith had been forced to obtain a supreme court order and the protection of 500
BKOB-4233||federal law enforcement personnel and played with 10
BKOB-4234||I was no longer the underdog the race was not mine to lose
BKOB-4235||expected the Press covering the Fiasco at the White House meeting had been merciless to McKay
BKOB-4236||the problems only grew worse when the campaign announced just a few hours before the debate
BKOB-4237||because of the quote progress that resulted from his intervention in Congressional negotiations around Park
BKOB-4238||it would lift the self-imposed suspension of his campaign and participate after all
BKOB-4239||we plan to show up regardless even if it meant I had a nice televised one-on-one conversation with the moderator Jim Lehrer
BKOB-4240||cornerstar McCain's latest move for what it was a hasty Retreat after a political stunt that is backfire
BKOB-4241||the debate itself offered few surprises McCain appeared relaxed onstage patching together line from his campaign speeches and standard Republican Orthodoxy delivered with ample dose
BKOB-4242||humor and charm still spotty knowledge of the details the financial crisis and its lack of answers for what he planned to do about it became more and more evident as we continued to Jeff
BKOB-4243||meanwhile I was on my game no doubt my training regimen of the hands of drill sergeant clean and Don wanted paid off
BKOB-4244||as much as I instinctively resisted canned answers to questions there was no denying but both television audiences and the pundits found my more practice responses compelling
BKOB-4245||and preparation kept me from drowning on too long
BKOB-4246||more than that though my mood for the debate with McCain was noticeably different
BKOB-4247||I'm like my debate with Hillary and the rest of the democratic field
BKOB-4248||what's the often felt like an elaborate game splitting hairs and notching style points
BKOB-4249||differences between me and John McCain were real and deep
BKOB-4250||steaks in choosing one of us over the other would reverberate for decades with consequences for Millions
BKOB-4251||confident my command of The Facts of why my ideas had a better chance than Johnson meeting the challenges the company not faced
BKOB-4252||energized by our exchanges and found myself almost enjoying our 90 minutes on stage
BKOB-4253||spent post-debate surveys of undecided voters showed me winning by a wide margin
BKOB-4254||bound 55 and probably a few private sighs of relief
BKOB-4255||wish I was happy but more subdued she hated going to debates
BKOB-4256||as she described as having to sit there looking Serene no matter what was said about me or how badly I screwed up for stomach-churning was like getting a tooth drilled without Novocain
BKOB-4257||in fact with her out of fear that it might jinx the outcome
BKOB-4258||or because of her own ambivalence about the prospect of my winning
BKOB-4259||generally avoided talking to me about the horse race aspects of the campaign
BKOB-4260||which is why I was surprised when in bed later that
BKOB-4262||you're going to win aren't you I can still happen but yeah
BKOB-4263||are pretty good chance I will I looked at my wife
BKOB-4264||her face was pensive as if she were working out of puzzle in her mind
BKOB-4265||finally she nodded or self and returned my gaze you're going to win she said Softly
BKOB-4266||kiss me on the cheek turn off the bedside lamp
BKOB-4267||I pulled the covers over her shoulders on September 29th free days after the debate adult mess
BKOB-4268||Bush's tarp legislation felt 13 votes short of passage in the House of Representatives
BKOB-4269||two-thirds of Democrats voting in support of them than two-thirds of Republicans voting against
BKOB-4270||Dow Jones immediately sustained a terrifying 778 Point drop
BKOB-4271||and after a pounding in the press and no doubt aflutter calls from constituents watching the retirement accounts evaporate
BKOB-4272||enough members of both parties flipped to pass animated version of the rescue package several days later
BKOB-4273||Raven relieved I called Hank Paulson to congratulate him for his efforts
BKOB-4274||the Walter Passage would prove to be critical and Save in the financial system
BKOB-4275||the whole episode did nothing to reverse the Public's growing impression that the GOP and by extension their nominee for president couldn't be trusted to responsibly handle the crisis
BKOB-4276||meanwhile the campaign decisions the clock to push for months earlier we're paying off
BKOB-4277||are army of organizers and volunteers fanned out across the country registry hundreds of thousands of new voters and launching unprecedented operations and states that allowed early vote
BKOB-4278||are online donations continue to flow allowing us to play and whatever media markets we chose
BKOB-4279||when the month ahead of the election the McCain campaign announced it was halting its efforts in Michigan historically a key Battleground state to concentrate its resources
BKOB-4280||Papa's almost offended when he said shaking his head
BKOB-4281||they might as well wave the White Flag instead of focusing energy on Michigan the McCain campaign turn their attention to a man who'd become an unlikely cult figure Joe Walter Bakr
BKOB-4282||I encountered were still biker a few weeks earlier cuz I did some old-fashioned door-knocking in Toledo Ohio
BKOB-4283||is the kind of campaigning I enjoyed most surprising people as they raped leaves or worked on their cars in the driveway watching Kids Zoom up on their bikes to see what the commotion was about
BKOB-4284||that day I was standing on the corner signing autographs and talking with a group of people
BKOB-4285||women with shaved heads would love to be in his late 30s introduced himself as Joe and asked about my pack play
BKOB-4286||the plumbery said he was worried that liberals like me would make it harder for him to succeed as a small business owner
BKOB-4287||with the Press pool cameras rolling explained my plan
BKOB-4288||would raise taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans in the by investing those revenues and things like education and infrastructure the economy and his business would be more likely to prosper
BKOB-4289||I told him that I believed that this sort of redistribution of income
BKOB-4290||when you spread the wealth around where my words at always been important in opening up opportunities for more people
BKOB-4291||Joe with affable but I'm convinced that we agree to disagree shaking hands before I left
BKOB-4292||in the van headed back to our hotel Gibbs like a great campaign communications director had an unerring knows for how a few seemingly innocuous words could trigger a political silliness told me my comment about spreading the wealth was problematic
BKOB-4293||what are you talkin about praise doesn't pull well
BKOB-4294||people associated with Communism and ship I laughed it off saying that the whole point of rolling back the Bush tax cuts what the redistribute income from people like me to folks like
BKOB-4295||kids look at me like parent whose child keeps on making the same mistake over and over again
BKOB-4296||turn off as soon as the footage of me at work laubacher instantly dubbed Joe the plumber surface
BKOB-4297||McCain started hammering on it during our debates
BKOB-4298||his campaign went all-in adjusting the salt of the earth guy in Ohio at unmask my secret socialist income redistribution agenda treating him like a Oracle of Middle America
BKOB-4299||Broadcast News anchors for something interviewing Joe
BKOB-4300||the plumber TV spots and McCain broad go with him to a few campaign rallies
BKOB-4301||drum self-esteem by turns amused baffled and occasionally put out by his Newfound Fame
BKOB-4302||but when all is said and done most voters interview Joe is not much more than a distraction from the serious business of electing the next president
BKOB-4303||most voters but not all for those who got their news from Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh Joe the play
BKOB-4304||neatly into some larger narrative involving Breath Right
BKOB-4305||mileage fealty to radical Community organizer Saul Alinsky my friendship with my neighbor billares who'd once been a leader in the militant group The Weather Underground and My Shadow a Muslim heritage

BKOB-4307||how something more Insidious someone to be feared
BKOB-4308||I'm going to be stuck to deliver this urgent patriotic message to the American people
BKOB-4309||increasingly looked for their most Fearless Champion Sarah Palin

BKOB-4313||he suggested that I was quote about a man who sees America the way you and I see America
BKOB-4314||people turned out for rallies wearing t-shirts bearing slogans like Halen's pitbulls and no communist

BKOB-4316||true Palin it seemed as if the dark spirits that has long been lurking at the edges the modern Republican Party
BKOB-4317||xenophobia anti-intellectualism paranoid conspiracy theories and antipathy to black and brown folks
BKOB-4318||finding their way to centre-stage it was a testament to John McCain's character
BKOB-4319||is fundamental decency that anytime a supporter approached him stealing Palin Spell rhetoric he politely pushed back
BKOB-4320||when a man at a Minnesota rally announced end of microphone that he was afraid of having me as a present
BKOB-4322||I have to tell you he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared of his present of United States He said
BKOB-4323||causing his audience to boo lustily answering another question he said we want to fight and I will fight
BKOB-4324||but we won't be respectful admire Senator Obama and his accomplishments
BKOB-4325||I will respect him I want everyone to be respectful and let's make sure we are because that's the way politics should be conducted in America
BKOB-4326||I wonder sometimes whether for the benefit of hindsight became would have still chosen Pella

BKOB-4328||I never posed the question to him directly of course or the next decade our relationship would evolve into one of grudging but genuine respect
BKOB-4329||the 2008 election understandably remains a sore point
BKOB-4330||I like to think that given the chance to do it over again
BKOB-4331||he might have chosen differently I believe he really did put his country first
BKOB-4332||the champ that has started with either child's or big hat and a small room in Greenwood South Carolina more than a year earlier

BKOB-4335||we had built something together you could feel the energy like a physical Force
BKOB-4336||just a few weeks ago before the election our field offices were scrambling to find enough space to accommodate the numbers of people signing on the volunteer
BKOB-4337||Shepard Fairey graphic art poster title hope with a stylized red-white-and-blue version of my face staring off into the distance seem suddenly ubiq
BKOB-4338||it felt as though the campaign that move Beyond politics and into the realm of popular culture
BKOB-4339||you're the new in thing Valerie with teeth
BKOB-4340||that worried me the inspiration our campaign was providing beside of so many young people newly invested in their ability to make change
BKOB-4341||bringing together Americans across racial and socioeconomic lines
BKOB-4342||it was the realization of everything I'd want to dream might be possible and politics and it made me proud
BKOB-4343||the continuing elevation of me as a symbol rent operated my organizers listings
BKOB-4344||Petsense the change involves we and not me
BKOB-4345||was personally disorienting to requiring me to constantly take stock to make sure I wasn't buying into the hype
BKOB-4346||remind myself of the distance between the airbrushed image in the flawed off and on certain person I was
BKOB-4347||I was also contending with the likelihood that if I was elected president it would be impossible to meet the outside deck Tech
BKOB-4348||attached to me since winning the Democratic nomination I've begun to experience reading the newspapers differently
BKOB-4349||in a way that gave me a joke every headline every story every expose
BKOB-4350||was another problem for me to solve the problems were piling up quickly
BKOB-4351||bikepark passage the financial system remained paralysed the housing market was in a nosedive the economy was sitting jobs at an accelerating rate and there was speculation that the big three automakers would soon be in jeopardy
BKOB-4352||responsibility of tackling these problems didn't scare me in fact I relished the chance
BKOB-4353||but from everything I was learning thing for like to get significantly worse before they got better
BKOB-4354||resolving the economic crisis not to mention winding down to Wars delivering on Healthcare and trying to save the planet from catastrophic climate change was going to be a long hard slog
BKOB-4355||would require a Cooperative Congress willing allies
BKOB-4356||uninformed mobilize citizenry they can sustain pressure on the 5th
BKOB-4357||Xavier what would happen when change them come fast enough
BKOB-4358||howdy cheering crowds respond to the inevitable setbacks and compromises
BKOB-4359||became a running joke between me and are we sure we want to win this thing it's not too late to try
BKOB-4360||Marty expressed more epic version of the same sentence
BKOB-4361||232 years and they wait until the country's falling apart before they turn it over to the brother
BKOB-4362||more than anything campaign-related it was news out of Hawaii the tempered by mood in October's waning days
BKOB-4363||Maya called saying the doctors didn't think it would last much longer perhaps no more than a week
BKOB-4364||she's not confined or rented hospital bed in the living room of her apartment
BKOB-4365||under the care of a hospice nurse in Antalya to drugs
BKOB-4366||although she started my sister with a sudden burst of Lucidity the preview
BKOB-4367||asking for the latest campaign news along with a glass of wine and a cigarette
BKOB-4368||she's now slipping in and out of Consciousness and throw 12 days before the election I made a 36-hour trip to Honolulu to say goodbye
BKOB-4369||Maya was waiting for me when I arrive at to support me
BKOB-4370||I thought that she'd been sitting on the couch with a couple of shoe boxes of old photographs and letters
BKOB-4371||I thought you might want to take some back with you she said
BKOB-4372||I picked up a few photos from the coffee table my grandparents and my eight-year-old mother laughing in a grassy field at Yosemite
BKOB-4373||me at the age of 45 riding on Grandpa's shoulders is waves splashed around the
BKOB-4374||four of us would Maya still toddler smiling in front of a Christmas tree
BKOB-4375||taking the chair beside the bed I held my grandmother's hand in mine
BKOB-4376||her body had wasted away and her breathing was labored
BKOB-4377||every so often should be shaken by violin metallic off just sounded like a grinding of gears
BKOB-4378||a few times she murmured softly although the words if any Escape
BKOB-4379||what dreams might she be having I wondered if she'd been able to look back and take stock
BKOB-4380||or whether she'd consider that too much of an Indulgence
BKOB-4381||I wanted to think that she did look back that she reveled in the memory of a long-ago lover or perfect summer day in her youth
BKOB-4382||what you experienced a bit of good fortune and the world who revealed itself to be big
BKOB-4383||and full of promise I thought back to a conversation I've had with her when I was in high school
BKOB-4384||around the time that a chronic back problems began making it difficult for her to walk for long stretches
BKOB-4385||thing about getting old bear to tecopa
BKOB-4386||if that you're the same person inside I remember I studying me through thick bifocals is it to make sure I was paying attention
BKOB-4387||trapped in this doggone Contraption the starts falling apart
BKOB-4388||tell you you understand
BKOB-4389||I did now for the next hour so I said talking to me about her work and her family all the while stroking to drive bony hand
BKOB-4390||but eventually the room felt too crowded with memories colliding merging refracting like images in the kaleidoscope
BKOB-4391||I told Maya want to take a quick walk outside at the Consulting with Gibbs in my secret service detail it was agreed that the Press pool downstairs would not be informed and I took the elevator to the basement level and went out to the garage
BKOB-4392||turning left on The Narrow Street that ran behind my grandparents apartment building
BKOB-4393||mistreated barely changed in 35 years
BKOB-4394||I got the rear of a small Shinto Temple & Community Center
BKOB-4395||Penrose wouldn't homes broken up by the occasional three-storey concrete apartment building
BKOB-4396||I bounced my first basketball I guess for my father when I was ten years old down the street
BKOB-4397||dribbling the length of the uneven sidewalk on my way to and from the courts at the nearby
BKOB-4398||my preschool too used to say that she always knew when I was coming home for dinner because you could hear that darn ball bouncing from ten stories
BKOB-4399||I'd run down the street to the supermarket to buy her cigarettes
BKOB-4400||motivated by a promise that I could buy candy bar with a change if I was back in ten minutes
BKOB-4401||later when I was 15 I've walked the same street home from a shift at my first job scooping ice cream at the Baskin-Robbins around the corner
BKOB-4402||to laugh and hardly when I grumbled to her about my pulse rapacious
BKOB-4404||modest consequence to the rest of the world
BKOB-4405||the one that is giving me love I'm stoob was gone
BKOB-4406||there would be no one left to remember that life or remembered me in it
BKOB-4407||I heard the Stampede of feet behind me the Press pool would somehow gotten wind of my unscheduled Excursion then we're gathering on the sidewalk across the street
BKOB-4408||cameramen jostling to set up the shots reporters with microphones looking at Miyake
BKOB-4409||clearly conflicted about shouting at question
BKOB-4410||they were decent about it really just doing their jobs and anyway I barely traveled four blocks
BKOB-4411||I gave the plastic wave and turned around to go back to the garage
BKOB-4412||there's no point in going farther I realized what I was looking for
BKOB-4413||was no longer there I watch the wire and went back to work
BKOB-4414||hey days later on the eve of the election my call to say to Ted.
BKOB-4415||is my last day of campaigning we were scheduled to be in North Carolina that evening before flying to Virginia for a final event
BKOB-4416||before heading to the venue access Me Gently if I needed help writing a Topper to my usual campaign remarks to briefly acknowledge my grandmother's death
BKOB-4417||I thanked him and said no I knew what I wanted to say
BKOB-4418||those beautiful night cool with a light rain
BKOB-4419||standing on the outdoor stage after the music and cheers and chants.
BKOB-4420||I spent a few minutes telling the crowd about you
BKOB-4421||how she grown up during the Depression and worked on an assembly line more grants was way in the war
BKOB-4422||what you meant for family what you might mean to them
BKOB-4423||she was one of those quiet Heroes that we have all across America show
BKOB-4424||turn off famous the names aren't in the newspapers
BKOB-4425||but each and every day they work hard they look after their families
BKOB-4426||a sacrifice for the children and their grandchildren
BKOB-4427||I'm seeking the Limelight all they try to do
BKOB-4428||just do the right thing and In This Crowd there's a lot of quiet Heroes like that mothers and fathers
BKOB-4429||grandparents with work hard and sacrificed all their lives
BKOB-4430||and the satisfaction that they get the same to their children and maybe their grandchildren are the great-grandchildren live a better life than they did
BKOB-4431||that's what America is about at Fort Worth Fighting For
BKOB-4432||it was a good closing argument for the campaign as I felt that I could get
BKOB-4433||if you're the candidate Election Day brings a surprising Stillness
BKOB-4434||there no more rallies or town halls TV and radio ads no longer matter
BKOB-4435||newscast have nothing of substance to report
BKOB-4436||campaign offices empty no staff and volunteers hit the streets to help her enough voters
BKOB-4437||across the country no answer stranger stepped behind the black curtain to register their policy preferences and private and stinks at some mysterious Collective Alchemy determines the country's fate and your own
BKOB-4438||the realization is obvious but also profound
BKOB-4439||it's out of your hands now pretty much all you can do is wait
BKOB-4440||what's an expert Driven Crazy by the helplessness passing hours on their blackberries scrounging for field reports rumors bad weather anything that might be take
BKOB-4441||the data point I took the opposite
BKOB-4442||giving myself over time Stern is one might live back and Float over away
BKOB-4443||I did start the morning by calling its well-rounded Drive Time radio shows
BKOB-4444||mostly black stations reminding people to get out and vote
BKOB-4445||around 7:30 Michelle and I cast our votes at the Beulah shoesmith Elementary School a few blocks from our home in Hyde Park
BKOB-4446||bringing Malia and Sasha with us and sending them on to school after that
BKOB-4447||I've been made a quick trip to Indianapolis to visit a field office and shake hands with voters
BKOB-4448||later I play basketball but Superstition Reggie and I have developed after we played the morning of the Iowa caucus but failed to play at the day of the New Hampshire primary with Michelle's brother Craig some old buddies and a handful of my friends Sons were fast and strong enough to keep us all working hard
BKOB-4449||what's the competitive game BB usual good-nature trash-talk
BKOB-4450||I noticed an absence of hard fouls this was / Greg's orders
BKOB-4451||Slater says he knew his sister would hold him accountable if I came home with a black eye
BKOB-4452||give me why was tracking news from the Battleground States reporting the turnout appear to be shattering records around the country creating problems at some polling places his voters waited 45 hours to captor balance
BKOB-4453||broadcast from the scenes give said some people more jubilant than frustrated with seniors and lawn chairs and volunteer passing up Refreshments as if they were all at a neighborhood block party
BKOB-4454||I spent the rest of the afternoon at home around uselessly while Michelle and the girls got their hair done
BKOB-4455||alone in my study I made a point of that adding the drafts of both my victory and Concession speeches
BKOB-4456||about 8 p.m. X call to say the Network's to call Pennsylvania in our favor
BKOB-4457||Marvin said we should start heading to the downtown hotel where we be watching the returns before moving over to the public gathering at Grand Park
BKOB-4458||outside the front Gates of our house number of Secret Service agents in vehicles seem to have doubled over the past few hours
BKOB-4459||better my detail Jeff Gilbert shook my hand and pulled me into a brief embrace
BKOB-4460||play warm for Chicago that time of year almost in the mid-60s
BKOB-4461||as we drove down Lake Shore Drive Michelle and I were quiet staring out the window at Lake Michigan
BKOB-4462||listening to the girls horsing around in the backseat something Malia turned to me and asked
BKOB-4464||I think so sweetie and we're supposed to be going to the big party to celebrate
BKOB-4465||that's right well it doesn't seem like that many people might be coming to the party
BKOB-4466||cuz there's no cars on the road I laughed realizing my daughter was right
BKOB-4467||State Farm motorcade the six Lanes in both directions were completely empty
BKOB-4468||security changed at the hotel as well but armed SWAT teams deployed in the stairwell
BKOB-4469||our family and closest friends were already in this week everyone smiling kids racing around the room
BKOB-4470||yet the atmosphere was still strangely music is that the reality of what was about to happen and yet settled in their mind
BKOB-4471||my mother-in-law particular made no pretense of being relaxed
BKOB-4472||through the day and I noticed her sitting on the couch her eyes fixed on the television
BKOB-4473||expression one of disbelief I tried to imagine what she must be thinking
BKOB-4474||and grown up just a few miles away during a time when there were still many Chicago neighborhoods the black couldn't even safely enter
BKOB-4475||Time Warner office work was Out Of Reach for most blacks and a father
BKOB-4476||unable to get a union card from the white control trade unions have been forced to make do as my tenant traits
BKOB-4477||time when the thought of a black US president would have seemed as far-fetched as a pig taking flight
BKOB-4478||I took a seat next to her on the couch you okay
BKOB-4479||Spradlin kept staring at the television
BKOB-4480||she said this is kind of too much
BKOB-4481||I know I took her hand squeezed
BKOB-4482||what's the weather setting in companionable silence for a few minutes
BKOB-4483||insomnia shot of my face flashed up on the TV screen and ABC News announced that I would be the 44th President of the United States
BKOB-4484||the room erupted shouts could be heard up and down the hall
BKOB-4485||the song I Kissed and she pulled back that way to give me the once-over as she laughed and shook her head
BKOB-4486||Ridgid Marvin rushed in to give everyone big bear hugs
BKOB-4487||plus action gets walked in and I don't them for several minutes as they rattled off state-by-state results before telling them what I knew to be true
BKOB-4488||as much as anything I've done it was their skill hard work inside tenacity loyalty and hard
BKOB-4489||along with the commitment of the entire team that had made this moment possible
BKOB-4490||the rest of the night is mostly a blur to me now I remember John McCain's phone call which was as gracious as his concession speech
BKOB-4491||the amplifier top proud America should be other history that have been made in place to help me succeed
BKOB-4492||door congratulatory calls from President Bush and several foreign in a conversation with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi
BKOB-4493||Borton fruit caucuses that had very good nights
BKOB-4494||I remember meeting Joe Biden's 91-year old mother it's a pleasure in telling me how she scolded Joe for even considering not being on the tick
BKOB-4495||more than 200,000 people have gathered in Grand Park that night
BKOB-4496||the stage facing Chicago's glittering Skyline
BKOB-4497||I can see in my mind even now some of the faces looking up as I walked on stage
BKOB-4498||man and women and children of every race some wealthy some poor
BKOB-4499||I'm famous and some not I'm smiling ecstatically
BKOB-4500||others openly weeping every redline for my speech that night
BKOB-4501||I've heard accounts from Staffing friends what it felt like to be there
BKOB-4502||but I worry that my memories of that night by so much else that's happened these past twelve years or shaded by the images that I've seen
BKOB-4503||the footage of our family walking across the stage
BKOB-4504||photographs of the crowds in whites and magnificent backdrops
BKOB-4505||as beautiful as they are they don't always match the lived experience
BKOB-4506||back my favorite photograph from that night is an event park at all
BKOB-4507||rather it's one I received many years later as a gift
BKOB-4508||photograph of the Lincoln Memorial taken as I was giving my speech in Chicago
BKOB-4509||it shows a small gathering of people on the stairs their faces obscured by the darkness
BKOB-4510||and behind them the giant figures shining brightly
BKOB-4511||good marble face craggy is I slightly downcast
BKOB-4512||they're listening to the radio antil quietly contemplating who we are as a people
BKOB-4513||and the Arc of this thing we call democracy
BKOB-4515||10:30 Whitehouse several times of the u.s. senator
BKOB-4516||I've never been inside the Oval Office before I was elected

BKOB-4520||the two doors that blend seamlessly into the gently curved walls
BKOB-4521||one leading out to the hallway the other to the outer oval where the president's personal aides are station
BKOB-4522||and a third leading to the present and small in her office and private dining room
BKOB-4523||there are the bus too long at L and Remington's famous bronze cowboy

BKOB-4528||dividing any child weather chance to crawl through it one thing cameras don't capture about the Oval Office is the light
BKOB-4529||the room is Awash in light unclear days of course through the huge windows on its eastern and southern ends painting every object with a golden Sheen that turns fine-grained and dappled
BKOB-4530||as the late afternoon sun receipts in bad weather on the south lawn is shrouded by

BKOB-4532||remains undimmed weaker natural light boosted by interior bulbs hidden behind a bracket of cornice and reflecting down from the ceiling and walls
BKOB-4533||lights are never turned off so the even in the middle of the night the Oval Office remains luminescent flaring against the darkness Like A Lighthouses rounded torch
BKOB-4534||I spent most of it years in that room grimly listening to intelligence reports hosting heads of state controlling members of Congress
BKOB-4535||jousting with allies and adversaries and posing for pictures with thousands of visitors
BKOB-4536||but staffers I laughed cursed more than once fought back tears
BKOB-4537||Agri comfortable enough to put my feet up or sit on the desk

BKOB-4540||Lose Myself and crowded streets and re-enter the LIE 51 smell
BKOB-4541||but I would never fully rid myself of the sense of reverence I felt whenever I walked into the Oval Office

BKOB-4548||Washington poems fall provided a welcome respite
BKOB-4549||Chicago's weather quickly turn cold and dark
BKOB-4550||an Arctic wind stripping the trees bare of leaves as if the unusually mild weather we enjoyed on Election night have been merely part of an elaborate set to be dismantled as soon as the celebration was.

BKOB-4571||especially ones with Ron again so much this record
BKOB-4572||I was mindful as well but for all President Bush's seeming Cachuma
BKOB-4573||my presence in the Brea office he'd soon be vacating must be stirring up difficult emotions
BKOB-4574||I followed his lead and not delving too deeply in the palace
BKOB-4575||mostly I just listened only once did he say something that surprised me
BKOB-4576||we were talking about the financial crisis and secretary Paulson's efforts to structure the rescue program for the banks now that tarp it passed through Congress
BKOB-4577||good news is it by the time you take office or taking care of the really tough stuff for you

BKOB-4581||no less dazzled B brightness no less eager than I was to change the world for the better
BKOB-4582||no less certain that history would judge his presidency a success
BKOB-4583||it took a lot of Courage on your part to get TARC pass I said finally
BKOB-4584||to go against public opinion and lot of people in your own party for the sake of the country
BKOB-4585||that much at least was true I saw no point in saying more

BKOB-4587||inside our house things didn't feel so different good morning spent fixing breakfast and getting the girls ready for school returning phone calls and talking to Stafford

BKOB-4596||I felt as if I now lived in my own portable Perpetual Ghost Town
BKOB-4598||Aldo's fear she has regular meaningful contact with fewer than 100 senior officials and personal Lakes
BKOB-4599||as president I would be able to articulate a vision instead of direction for the country
BKOB-4600||promote a healthy organizational culture and establish clear lines of responsibility and measures of accountability
BKOB-4601||I would be the one who made final decisions on issues that brought to my attention
BKOB-4602||explain those decisions to the country at Large

BKOB-4604||those who would become my managers Executives facilitators analyst organizers team leaders amplifiers conciliators problem-solvers black catchers honest Brokers sounding boards constructive critics and loyal soldiers
BKOB-4605||is crucial them to get these early appointments right
BKOB-4606||starting with the person who could serve as my chief of staff
BKOB-4607||unfortunately the initial response for my number one recruit for the job was less than enthusiastic

BKOB-4617||in the modern White House the chief of staff was the day today quarterback
BKOB-4618||the end of the funnel through which every issue facing the president had the first pass
BKOB-4619||G1 government including the president for longer hours or under more unrelenting pressure
BKOB-4620||Brom was wrong about me having a better choice after two punishing years on the campaign plus it already told me that he would initially be joining the administration
BKOB-4621||in part because his wife Olivia had delivered a new baby just three days after the election
BKOB-4622||but my son is Chief of Staff Pete Rouse and former Clinton Chief of Staff John podesta Ford agreed to help manage our transition team at taking themselves out of the Run
