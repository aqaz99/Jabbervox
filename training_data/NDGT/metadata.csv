NDGT-2||evidence for this abounds from Hit television shows inspired or informed by science to the success of Science Fiction film starring Marquis actors and brought to the screen by celebrated producers and directors
NDGT-3||and lately CI trickle release biopics featuring important scientist and become a genre unto itself there's also widespread interest around the world in science festival science fiction convention in science documentaries for television
NDGT-4||the highest grossing film of all time is by a famous director who said his story on a planet orbiting a distant star
NDGT-5||and it features a famous actress who plays an astrobiologist
NDGT-6||what most branches of science have ascended in this era the field of astrophysics persistently Rises to the top
NDGT-7||I think I know why at one time or another every one of us has looked up at the night sky and wondered what does it all mean how is it all work and what is my place in the universe
NDGT-8||if you're too busy to absorb the cosmos by a classes textbooks or documentaries and you nonetheless he could brief but meaningful introduction to the field I offer you astrophysics for people in a hurry
NDGT-9||into swim Bali you learn a foundational fluency in all the major ideas in discoveries the driver modern understanding of the universe
NDGT-10||if I succeeded you'll be culturally conversant in my field of expertise and you just may be hungry for more
NDGT-11||the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you
NDGT-12||chapter 1 The Greatest Story Ever Told
NDGT-13||the world has persisted many a long year having once been set going into the appropriate motions from these everything else follows
NDGT-14||lucretius 50 BC
NDGT-15||in the beginning nearly 14 billion years ago all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one trillionth the size of the. That ends the sentence
NDGT-17||Einstein's general theory of relativity Woodforest in 1916 give us our modern understanding of gravity in which the presence of matter and energy curves the fabric of space and time surrounding it
NDGT-19||although we haven't yet reached the Finish Line we know exactly where the
NDGT-20||my hurdles are is during the Planck era of the early universe that's the interval of time from t equal 0 up 2T equals 10 to the - 43 seconds
NDGT-21||110 million trillion trillion trillions of a second after the beginning and before the universe Groove to 10 to the - 35 m
NDGT-23||the clash between gravity and Quantum mechanic poses no practical problem for the Contemporary universe
NDGT-24||astrophysicist apply the tenets and tools of general relativity and quantum mechanics two very different classes of problems but in the beginning during the Planck era
NDGT-26||we none of us expect that by the end of the Planck era gravity wriggled loose from the other still unified forces of nature achieving an independent identity nicely described by our current theories
NDGT-28||with the weak Force controlling radioactive decay the strong show
NDGT-29||binding the atomic nucleus the electromagnetic force binding molecules and gravity binding bulk matter
NDGT-30||trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning
NDGT-31||all the while the interplay of matter in the form of subatomic particles and energy in the form of photons massless vessels of light energy that is much waves as they are particles was incessant
NDGT-33||how much energy your matter is worth the c squared is the speed of light squared a huge number which when multiplied by The Mask reminds us how much energy you actually get in this exercise
NDGT-35||so each comes in several varieties the ordinary photon is a member of the boson family the let X most familiar to the non physicists are the electron and perhaps the neutrino
NDGT-36||and the most familiar quarks are well there are no familiar quarks each of their six subspecies has been assigned an abstract name that serves no real philological philosophical or pedagogical purpose except to distinguish it
NDGT-37||mother's up and down strange and Charmed and top and bottom
NDGT-38||bosons by the way or name for the Indian scientist sucky and written off Bose the word Lettin derived from the Greek Leto's meaning light or small
NDGT-40||3 corks for muster Mark Winston Court to do have going for them all their names are simple
NDGT-41||something chemist biologist and especially geologist seem incapable of achieving when naming their own stuff
NDGT-42||corks or quirky beats unlike protons each with an electric charge of plus one and electrons with a charge of -1 quarks have fractional charges that come in thirds
NDGT-44||separate the quarks enough the rubber band snaps and the stored energy summons equals mc squared to create a new Quark at each end leaving you back where you started
NDGT-46||the discovery of this state of matter has a kind of Quark cauldron was reported for the first time in 2002 by a team of physicists at the Brookhaven National Laboratories Long Island New York
NDGT-47||strong theoretical evidence suggests that an episode in the very early Universe perhaps during one of the four splits endow the universe with a remarkable asymmetry in which particles of matter mayerle outnumbered particles of antimatter
NDGT-48||by about a billion in one to a billion
NDGT-49||that's small difference in population would hardly get noticed by anybody amid the continuous creation Annihilation and Recreation of quarks and antiquarks electrons and anti electrons better known as positrons and neutrinos and antineutrinos
NDGT-50||the odd man out rules of opportunity to find somebody to annihilate with and so did everybody else
NDGT-51||not for much longer as the cosmos continue to expand and cool row
NDGT-52||larger than the size of our solar system the temperature dropped rapidly below a trillion degrees Kelvin
NDGT-53||a millionth of a second has passed since the beginning
NDGT-54||this tepid Universe was no longer hot enough or dense enough to cook quarks and so they all grabbed dance Partners creating a permanent new family of heavy particles called hadrons
NDGT-55||from the Greek hadros meaning thick
NDGT-56||Tech work to hadron transition soon resulted in the emergence of protons and neutrons as well as other less-familiar heavy particle or compose a various combinations of quarks PCS
NDGT-58||Hadron Collider the slight matter-antimatter asymmetry afflicting the Quark lepton soup now passed to the hadrons but with extraordinary consequences
NDGT-59||as the universe continue to cool the amount of energy available for the spontaneous creation of basic particles dropped
NDGT-60||during the hedron era ambient photons could no longer invoke E equals MC squared to manufacture quark-antiquark pairs
NDGT-61||not only that the photons that emerge from all the remaining Annihilation lost energy to the ever-expanding universe dropping below the threshold required to create hadron anti had run pairs
NDGT-62||for every billion and violations leaving a billion photons in their wake a single hadrons survive
NDGT-63||those lawyers would get to have all the fun serving as the ultimate source of matter to create galaxies stars planets and petunias
NDGT-64||without the billion and one to a billion imbalance between matter and antimatter all mass of the universe would have self annihilated leaving a cosmos made of photons and nothing else the ultimate let there be lights in area
NDGT-65||by now one second of time has passed
NDGT-66||the universe has grown to a few light-years across about the distance from the Sun to the closest neighboring Stars
NDGT-68||what was true for quarks and true for hadrons had become true for electrons eventually only one electron in a billion survives the rest annihilate with positrons their antimatter sidekick
NDGT-69||in a sea of photons right about now one electron for every proton has been frozen into existence
NDGT-71||2 minutes have now passed since the beginning
NDGT-72||for another three hundred and eighty thousand years not much will happen to our particle soup throughout these Millennia the temperature remains hot enough for electrons to roam free among the photons batting them to and fro as they interact with one another
NDGT-73||but this Freedom comes to an abrupt end when the temperature of the universe Falls below 3000
NDGT-75||for the first billion years the universe continue to expand and cool as matter gravitated into the massive concentrations we call Galaxy S
NDGT-76||nearly 100 billion of them formed each containing hundreds of billions of stars that undergo thermonuclear Fusion in their cores
NDGT-77||those stars with more than about 10 times the mass of the Sun the chief sufficient pressure and temperature in their cores to manufacture dozen development heavier than hydrogen including those that compose a planet and whatever life make Thrive upon them
NDGT-78||these elements would be stunningly useless where they tow
NDGT-81||this occurred in the form of high-speed high energy impacts which rendered Multan the surfaces of the rocky planets preventing the formation cam
NDGT-82||it's molecules as less and less a credible matter remained in the solar system planets surfaces began to cool
NDGT-85||lease early single-celled organisms unwittingly transformed Earth's carbon dioxide Rich atmosphere into one with sufficient oxygen to allow aerobic organism
NDGT-87||we owe the remarkable diversity of life on Earth and we presume elsewhere in the universe to the cosmic abundance of carbon and the countless number of simple and complex molecules that contain it
NDGT-88||there's no doubt about it more varieties of carbon-based molecules exist than all other kinds of molecules combine
NDGT-89||but life is fragile Earth's occasional encounters with large Wayward comets and asteroids a formerly common event wreaks intermittent Havoc Upon Our ecosystem
NDGT-90||a mere 65 million years ago less than 2% of Earth's past attend trilliant on asteroid
NDGT-91||hit what is now that Yucatan Peninsula and obliterated More than 70% of Earth's flora and fauna including all the same as outside dinosaurs
NDGT-92||Extinction this ecological catastrophe enabled our mammal ancestors to fill freshly vacant niches rather than continue to serve as hors d'oeuvres for T-Rex
NDGT-93||one big brained branch of these mammals that which we call primates evolved the genus and species Homo sapiens with sufficient intelligence to invent methods and tools of science and to deduce the origin and evolution of the universe
NDGT-94||what happened before all this what happened before the beginning
NDGT-95||astrophysicists have no idea or rather our most creative ideas have little or no grounding in experimental science
NDGT-96||in response some religious people assert with a tinge of righteousness that something must have started it all
NDGT-97||force greater than all others a source from which everything is shoes a prime mover in the mind of such a person that something is of course God
NDGT-98||but what if the universe was always there in a state or condition we have yet to identify
NDGT-100||these philosophically fun ideas usually satisfied nobody
NDGT-101||nonetheless they remind us to the ignorance is the natural state of mind for a research scientist
NDGT-102||people who believe they're ignorant of nothing have neither look for North stumbled upon the boundary between what is known and unknown in the universe
NDGT-103||what we do now and what we can assert without further hesitation is that the Universe had a beginning do you know
NDGT-104||continues to evolve and yes every one of our bodies atoms is traceable to the big bang and to the thermonuclear furnaces within high mass stars that exploded more than 5 billion years ago
NDGT-105||we are Stardust brought to life than empowered by the universe to figure itself out
NDGT-106||and we have only just begun chapter 2
NDGT-107||honors as in the heavens until Sir Isaac Newton wrote down the universal law of gravitation nobody had any reason to presume that the laws of physics at home with the same everywhere else in the universe
NDGT-108||Earth had Earthly things going on and Heavens had Heavenly things going on
NDGT-109||according to Christian teachings of the day God control the heavens rendering them unknowable to our feeble mortal Minds
NDGT-110||when Newton Reach This philosophical barrier by rendering almost
NDGT-111||comprehensible and predictable some theologians criticized him for leaving nothing for the Creator to do
NDGT-112||Newton had figured out that the force of gravity pulling right apples from the orchard also guideposts objects along their curved trajectories and directs the moon in its orbit around Earth
NDGT-113||Newton's law of gravity also guides planets asteroids and comets and their orbits around the Sun and keeps hundreds of billions of stars in orbit within our Milky Way galaxy
NDGT-114||this universality of physical laws Drive scientific discovery like nothing else
NDGT-115||gravity was just the beginning imagine the excitement among 19th century astronomers when laboratory prisms which brake light beings into a spectrum of colors with first turn to the Sun
NDGT-116||Spectra are not only beautiful but contain noodles have information about the light emitting object including its temperature and composition
NDGT-117||chemical elements billing cells by their unique patterns of light or dark band that cut across the Spectrum
NDGT-118||to people's delight and amazement the chemical signatures on the sun right denticle to those in the laboratory
NDGT-119||no longer the exclusive tool of Kemet the prison showed that as different as the Sun is from Earth in size mass temperature location and appearance
NDGT-120||we both contain the same stuff hydrogen carbon oxygen nitrogen calcium iron so forth
NDGT-121||but more important than our laundry list of shared ingredients was the recognition that the laws of physics prescribing the formation of the spectral signatures on the sun with the same laws operating on Earth 93 million miles away
NDGT-122||souffrant was this concept of universality that it was successfully applied in reverse
NDGT-123||further analysis of the sun Spectrum revealed the signature of an element that had no known count
NDGT-124||what on Earth being of the Sun the new substance was given a name derived from the Greek word Helios the Sun
NDGT-125||and was only later discovered in the lab thus helium became the first and only element in the chemist periodic table to be discovered someplace other than Earth
NDGT-126||okay the laws of physics work in the solar system but do they work across the Galaxy Across the Universe across time itself
NDGT-127||step-by-step the walls were tested nearby Stars also revealed familiar chemical distant binary Stars bound and mutual orbit seem to know all about Newton's laws of gravity
NDGT-128||for the same reason so do binary galaxies
NDGT-129||and like a geologist stratified sediments would serve as a timeline of Earthly events the farther away we look in Space the further back in time we see
NDGT-130||Spectra from the most distant objects in the universe show the same time
NDGT-131||signatures that we see nearby in space and in time
NDGT-132||troop heavy elements were less abundant back then they are manufactured primarily in subsequent generations of exploding stars but the laws describing the atomic and molecular process these that created these special signatures remain intact
NDGT-133||in particular the quantity known as the fine structure constant which controls the basic fingerprinting for every element must have remained unchanged for billions of years
NDGT-135||when spectral analysis was first applied to the light emitted by Interstellar nebulae a signature was discovered that once again had no counterpart on Earth at the time that.
NDGT-136||table of elements and no obvious place for a new element to fit in response astrophysicists invented the name nebula Liam as a placeholder until they can figure out what was going on
NDGT-137||turned out that is space gaseous nebulae are so rarefied that atoms go long stretches without colliding
NDGT-138||under these conditions electron can do things within atoms that have never before been seen in Earth labs
NDGT-139||nebula it was simply the signature of ordinary oxygen doing extraordinary things
NDGT-141||diether outstretch appendage is a hand would be considered an act of war or peace
NDGT-142||your best hope is to find a way to communicate using the language of science
NDGT-143||such an attempt was made in the 1970s with Pioneer 10 and 11 and 43 1 and 2
NDGT-144||all for spacecraft wind out with enough energy after gravity assist from the giant planets to escape the solar system entirely
NDGT-145||Pioneer wore a golden etched plaque that showed and scientific pictograms the layout of our solar system our location in the Milky Way galaxy and the structure of the hydrogen atom
NDGT-146||Voyager went further and also included a gold record album containing diverse sounds from Mother Earth including the human heartbeat whale songs and musical selection from around the world including the works of Beethoven and Chuck Berry
NDGT-147||what was humanise the message it's not clear whether alien ears would have a clue
NDGT-148||they were listening to assuming they have ears in the first place
NDGT-149||my favorite parody of this gesture was a skit on NBC Saturday Night Live shortly after the Voyager launched in which they showed a written reply from the alien recover the spacecraft the note simply requested send more Chuck Berry
NDGT-150||Science Drive not only of the universality of physical laws but also on the existence and Persistence of physical constants
NDGT-151||the constant of gravitation known by most scientists as Big G supplies Newton's equation of gravity with the measure of how strong the force will be this quantity has been implicit Lee tested for variation over eons
NDGT-152||if you do the math you can determine that a star's Luminosity is steeply dependent on Big G
NDGT-153||in other words if BG had been even slightly different in the past than the energy output of the sun would have been far more variable than anything the biological climb
NDGT-154||logical or geological records indicate
NDGT-155||such is the uniformity of our universe
NDGT-156||among all constant the speed of light is the most famous
NDGT-157||no matter how fast you go you will never overtake a beam of light
NDGT-158||why not no experiment ever conducted as ever revealed an object of any form reaching the speed of light
NDGT-159||well tested laws of physics predict an account for that fact
NDGT-160||I know these statements sound close-minded some of those boneheaded science-based proclamations in the past and underestimated the Ingenuity of inventors and engineers
NDGT-161||we will never fly fly it will never be commercially feasible we will never split the atom you will never break the sound barrier we will never go to the Moon
NDGT-162||what they have in common is that no established law of physics to it in their way
NDGT-163||the claim you will never outrun a beam of light Issaquah
NDGT-164||potato flea different prediction it flows from basic time-tested physical principles
NDGT-165||highway signs for Interstellar travel to the future will justifiably read the speed of light it's not just a good idea it's the law
NDGT-166||unlike getting caught speeding on Earth Road the good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them although I did once owned a geeky t-shirt they proclaimed obey gravity
NDGT-167||all measurements suggest that the known fundamental constants and the physical laws that reference them are neither time-dependent nor location-dependent their truly constant and Universal
NDGT-168||many natural phenomena manifest multiple physical laws operating at once
NDGT-169||this fact often complicates the analysis and in most cases requires high-performance Computing to calculate what's going on and to keep track of important
NDGT-171||climate and weather represent other leading examples of complicated and difficult to predict phenomena
NDGT-172||what's a basic laws governing them are still at work
NDGT-173||Jupiter's Great Red Spot a raging anticyclone it's been going strong for at least 350 years is driven by identical physical processes that generates storms on Earth and elsewhere in the solar system
NDGT-174||another class of universal truths is the conservation laws with the amount of some measure quantity remains unchanged no matter what
NDGT-175||three most important are the conservation of mass and energy conservation of linear and angular momentum and the conservation of electric charge
NDGT-176||these laws are in evidence on Earth and everywhere we have thought to look from the domain particle physics to the large-scale structure of the universe
NDGT-178||may be composed of exotic particles that we have yet to discover or identify
NDGT-179||small minardi of astrophysicists however are unconvinced and if suggested that there was no dark matter you just need to modify Newton's law gravity simply add a few components to the equations and all will be well
NDGT-180||perhaps one day we will learn that Newton's gravity indeed requires adjustment that'll be okay it is happened once before Einstein's 1916 General series
NDGT-181||tivity expanded on the principles of Newton's gravity in a way that also apply to object of extremely high mass
NDGT-182||Newton's law of gravity breaks down in this expanded realm which was unknown to him
NDGT-183||the lesson here is that our confidence flows to the range of conditions over which the law has been tested and verified
NDGT-184||the broader that range the more potent and Powerful the law becomes in describing the cosmos for ordinary household gravity Newton's law works just fine it got us to the moon and returned safely to Earth in 1969
NDGT-186||do the scientist the universality of physical laws makes the cosmos A marvelously simple place
NDGT-187||by comparison human nature the psychologist domain is infinitely more daunting
NDGT-188||in America local school boards vote on subject to be taught in the classroom
NDGT-189||some cases votes are cast according to the whims of cultural political or religious tithes around-the-world varying belief system lead to political differences that are not always resolved peacefully
NDGT-190||the power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere whether or not you choose to believe in them
NDGT-191||in other words after the laws of physics everything else is opinion
NDGT-192||not the scientist don't argue we do a lot but when we do we typically Express opinions about the interpretation of insufficient or ratty data on the bleeding Frontier of our knowledge wherever and whenever a physical law can be invoked in the
NDGT-193||the debate is guaranteed to be brief
NDGT-195||you could in principle perform the stunts if you manage to let forth a powerful and sustained exhaust the flatulence
NDGT-196||knowledge of physical laws can in some cases give you the confidence to confront Surly people
NDGT-197||a few years ago I was having a hot cocoa nightcap at a dessert shop in Pasadena California or did it with whipped cream of course when it arrived at the table I saw a no trace of the stuff
NDGT-198||after I told the waiter that Mike Coco had no whipped cream is certain
NDGT-200||unconvinced he defiantly brought over a dollop of whipped cream to demonstrate his claim
NDGT-201||after bobbing once or twice the whipped cream Rose to the top safely afloat
NDGT-202||what better proof do you need of the universality of physical law
NDGT-203||chapter 3 let there be light
NDGT-204||after the big bang the main agenda of the cosmos with expansion ever diluting the concentration of energy that filled space
NDGT-205||with each passing moment the universe got a little bit bigger a little bit cooler and a little bit dimmer
NDGT-207||any Photon you detected had Kareem off an electron right in front of your nose Nano and PS earlier a billion and a trillion to the second
NDGT-208||that's the largest distance that information can travel before Reaching Your Eyes the entire universe was simply a glowing opaque fog in every direction you look
NDGT-209||the sun and the Stars behave this way to
NDGT-210||as the temperature drops particles move more and more slowly and so right about then when the temperature of the universe first dipped below a red-hot sweet thousand degrees K electron
NDGT-211||slow down just enough to be captured by passing protons thus bringing full-fledged atoms into the world
NDGT-214||what's next on the Spectrum today the universe is expanded by a factor of 1,000 from the time photons were set free and so the cosmic background has interned cooled by
NDGT-215||after 1000 all the visible light photons from that epic have become 1/1000 is energetic there now microwaves which is where we derive the modern moniker Cosmic microwave background or CMB for short
NDGT-216||keep this up and 50 billion years from now astrophysicists will be writing about the cosmic radio wave background
NDGT-217||when something goes from being heated it emits light in all parts of the spectrum but will always Peak somewhere
NDGT-218||per household lamps that still use glowing metal filament the bulbs all peak in the infrared which is the single greatest contributor to their inefficiency as a source of visible light
NDGT-219||our senses detect infrared only the form of warmth on our skin
NDGT-220||the LED Revolution and advanced lighting technology creates pure visible light without wasting water John invisible parts of the spectrum that's how you can get crazy-sounding sentences on packaging like 7 w
NDGT-221||LED replace a 60-watt incandescent
NDGT-222||being the remnant of something that was once brilliantly ago the CMP has the profile we expect of a radiant but cooling object
NDGT-223||the peaks in one part of the spectrum but radiates in other parts of the spectrum as well in this case beside peaking in microwaved the CMB also gives off some radio waves at a vanishingly small number of photons of higher energy
NDGT-224||in the mid-twentieth century the subfield of cosmology not to be confused with cosmetology didn't have much data and where data are sparse competing ideas of bound that are clever and Wishful
NDGT-228||pause for a moment Herman and Alfred
NDGT-229||use Atomic physics freshly gleaned in a lab and applied it to hypothesize conditions in the early Universe from this the extrapolated billions of years forward calculating what temperature the universe should be today
NDGT-230||that their prediction even remotely approximated the right answer is a stunning Triumph of human inside
NDGT-232||the first direct observation of the cosmic microwave background was made inadvertently in 1964 by American physicist Arno penzias and Rob
NDGT-233||Wilson at Bell Telephone Laboratories the research branch of AT&T
NDGT-235||they would not cuz Mahalo gist they were techno Wizards holding a microwave receiver and unaware of the gam of Herman and Alfred predictions
NDGT-237||buy but one part of the signal didn't go away and they just couldn't figure out how to eliminate it finally they look inside their antennae and saw pigeons nesting there
NDGT-238||they were worried that a white dielectric substance pigeon poop might be responsible for the signal because they detected it no matter what direction the detector appointed
NDGT-239||after cleaning out the dielectric substance the interference dropped a little bit but a leftover signal remain
NDGT-240||the paper they published in 1965 was all about this unaccountable excess antenna temperature
NDGT-241||meanwhile team of physicists at Princeton led by Robert Dickey was building a detector specifically to find the CMB
NDGT-242||but they didn't have the resources of bell Labs so their work went a little slower
NDGT-243||in the moment Dickey and his colleagues heard about penzias and Wilson's work the Princeton team knew exactly what they observed excess antenna temperature was
NDGT-244||everything fit especially the temperature itself and that the signal came from every direction in the sky
NDGT-245||1978 penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize for their discovery
NDGT-249||in the Big Bang model this Cyanogen and distant younger galaxies gets bathed in a warmer cosmic background in the Cyanogen in our own Milky Way galaxy
NDGT-250||and that's exactly what we observe you can't make this stuff up
NDGT-252||unimpeded across the universe as carriers of this information
NDGT-253||the spot where each Photon began its cross Cosmo's journey is weird head smacked into the last electron that would ever stand in its way
NDGT-256||when matter accumulated the strength of gravity grew enabling more and more matter
NDGT-257||together these Regency to the formation of galaxies superclusters while other regions were left relatively empty
NDGT-259||starting its pattern is like performing some sort of cosmic phrenology as we analyze the skull bumps of the infant Universe when constrained by other observations of the Contemporary and distant Universe the CMB and they
NDGT-261||from here it's been straightforward to tell whether or not the universe will expand forever
NDGT-262||ordinary matter is what we're all made of it has gravity and interacts with light
NDGT-263||dark matter is a mysterious substance that has gravity but does not interact with light in any known way
NDGT-264||dark energy is a mysterious pressure in the vacuum of space that act in the opposite direction of gravity force in the universe to expand faster than it otherwise would
NDGT-265||what are phrenological exam says is that we understand how do you know
NDGT-266||misbehaved but that most of the universe is made of stuff about which we are clueless
NDGT-268||the simple discovery of the cosmic microwave background turn cosmology into something more than mythology
NDGT-269||but it was the accurate and detailed map of the cosmic microwave background that turn cosmology into a modern science
NDGT-270||cuz I'll just have plenty of ego how could you not when your job is to deduce what brought the universe into existence
NDGT-271||without data your explanations were just hypotheses now each new observation each morsel of data wields a two-edged sword it enables cosmology to thrive on
NDGT-272||kind of foundation it's so much of the rest of science enjoys but it also constrains theories that people thought up when there wasn't enough data to say whether they were right or wrong
NDGT-273||no science achieves maturity without it
NDGT-274||chapter 4 betraying the galaxies
NDGT-275||in the grand tally of cosmic constituents galaxies are with typically gave counted latest estimates show that the observable universe may contain 100 billion of them
NDGT-276||bright and beautiful and packed with stars galaxies decorate the dark boys of space like cities across the country at night but just how voided is the void of space
NDGT-277||how empty is the countryside between cities just because galaxies are in your face and just because they would have us believe that nothing else matters the universe may nonetheless contain hard-to-detect things between the galaxies maybe those things are more
NDGT-278||anger more important to the evolution of the universe than the galaxies themselves
NDGT-279||our own spiral-shaped galaxy The Milky Way is named for its spilled milk appearance to the unaided eye across earth nighttime sky
NDGT-280||indeed the very word Galaxy derives from the Greek galaxias milk
NDGT-281||our pair of nearest neighbor Galaxy six hundred thousand light-years distant are both small and irregularly shaped
NDGT-282||Ferdinand Magellan's ships log identified the cosmic object during his famous round-the-world voyage in 1519
NDGT-283||it is honor we call them the large and small magellanic clouds and they're visible primarily from the southern hemisphere as a pair of cloud like splotches on the sky parked beyond the stars
NDGT-284||the nearest galaxy larger than our own is 2 million light-years away beyond the stars that race the constellation Andromeda this spiral galaxy is starkly dubbed the great nebula in
NDGT-285||Trump is a somewhat more massive and luminous twin of the Milky Way
NDGT-286||news that the name for each system lacks reference to the existence of stars Milky Way magellanic Cloud Andromeda nebula all three were named before telescopes were invented so they could not get be resolved into their Stellar constituencies
NDGT-287||as detailed in chapter 9 without the benefit of telescopes operating in multiple bands of light we might still declare the space between the galaxies to be empty
NDGT-289||looks like that one could argue that all the fun in the universe happens between the galaxies rather than within them
NDGT-290||in any reliably surveyed volume of space dwarf galaxies outnumber large Galaxy by more than 10 21
NDGT-291||the first essay I ever wrote on the universe in the early 1980s was titled the galaxies in the Seven Dwarfs referring to the Milky Way's diminutive nearby family
NDGT-292||since then the tally of local dwarf galaxies has been counted in the dozens while full-blooded galaxies contain hundreds of billions of stars dwarf galaxies can have as few as a million which renders them a hundred thousand times harder to detect
NDGT-293||the Wonder they're still being discovered in front of our noses
NDGT-294||images of dwarf galaxies that no longer manufacture Stars tend to look like tiny boring smudges
NDGT-295||those doors that dew form stars are all irregularly-shaped and quite frankly or a sorry-looking what dwarf Galaxies have three
NDGT-297||you'll find most known dwarf galaxies hanging out near bigger galaxies in orbit around them Like Satellites the to magellanic clouds are part of the Milky Way is dwarf family
NDGT-298||what's the live satellite galaxies can be quite hazardous most computer models of their orbit show a slow Decay that ultimately result in the hapless doors getting ripped apart and then eaten by the main gal
NDGT-301||other stores remain a drift about 10% of all large galaxies show evidence of a major graph
NDGT-302||patient encounter with another large Galaxy and that rate maybe five times higher among galaxies and clusters
NDGT-303||with all this Mayhem how much Galactic Flotsam permeate Intergalactic space especially within clusters
NDGT-304||nobody knows for sure the measurement is difficult because isolated stars or too dim to detect individually
NDGT-305||we must rely on detecting a faint glow produced by the Light Of All Stars combined
NDGT-306||in fact observations of clusters to text just such a glow between the galaxies suggesting that there may be as many Vagabond homeless stars as there are stars within the galaxies themselves
NDGT-308||you not so isolated supernovas May betray and tire populations of undetected Stars
NDGT-309||supernovas are stars that have blown themselves to Smithereens and in the process have temporarily over several weeks increase their Luminosity a billion fold making them visible Across the Universe
NDGT-310||well it doesn't homeless supernovas is a relatively small number many more may await Discovery since most Supernova researches systematically monitor known galaxies and not empty space
NDGT-312||the very movement of gas-rich galaxies through this medium eventually strips them of their own gas forcing
NDGT-314||in the rest of space outside of clusters there's a population of galaxies that thrive long ago as already noted looking out into the cosmos is analogous to a geologist looking across sedimentary Strata with a history of rock formation is laid out in full View
NDGT-315||Cosmic distances are so bad that the travel time for light to reach us can be millions or even billions of years
NDGT-316||when the universe was half its current age a very blue and very faint species of intermediate size Galaxy thrived we see them
NDGT-317||they hail from a long time ago representing galaxies Far Far Away there blue comes from the glow of freshly form short-lived high-mass high temperature high Luminosity Stars
NDGT-319||it all their Stars burnout have they become invisible corpses strewn throughout the Universe did they evolved into the familiar dwarf galaxies of today or were they all eaten by larger galaxies we do not know what their place in the timeline of cosmic history is certain
NDGT-320||call the stuff between the big galaxies we might expect some of it to him
NDGT-321||your review of what lies Beyond this could be a problem for the most distant objects in the universe such as quasars quasars or superluminous Galaxy Kors whose light has typically been traveling for billions of years across space before reaching our telescopes
NDGT-322||as extremely distant sources of light they make ideal guinea pigs for the detection of intervening junk
NDGT-324||every known Quasar reveals these hydrogen features
NDGT-325||we conclude that the hydrogen clouds are everywhere in the universe and as expected the farther Quasar the more clouds are present in the Spectrum
NDGT-327||meanwhile Quasar like commonly passes through regions of space that can tame monsters sources of gravity which wreak havoc on the quasars image
NDGT-328||these are often hard to detect because they may be composed of ordinary matter that is simply too dim and distant or maybe zones of Dark Matters such as what occupies the center isn't surrounding regions of Galaxy clusters
NDGT-329||in either case where there is mass there is gravity and where there's gravity there is
NDGT-331||depending on the mass of the lens itself and the geometry of the line of sight alignment the lensing action can magnify distort we can split the background source of light into multiple images just like Funhouse mirrors at arcades
NDGT-332||what are the most distant known objects in the universe is not a quasar but an ordinary Galaxy whose feeble light has been magnified significantly by the action of an intervening gravitational lens
NDGT-333||we may henceforth need to rely upon these Intergalactic telescopes to appear where and when ordinary telescopes cannot reach and dust reveal the future holders of the cosmic discs
NDGT-335||their Argent continues to be a mystery but most of these charged particles are protons the nuclei of hydrogen atoms and are moving at 99.9999
NDGT-338||chapter 5 dark matter
NDGT-339||Gravity the most familiar Nature's forces office of simultaneously the best and the least understood phenomena in nature
NDGT-341||it took the mind of the last Century's most brilliant and influential person Albert Einstein to show that we can more accurately describe gravity's action-at-a-distance as a warp in the fabric of space-time produced by any combination of matter and energy
NDGT-342||Einstein demonstrated that Newton's Theory requires some modification to describe gravity accurately to predict for example
NDGT-343||which light rays will bend when they pass by a massive object although Einstein's equations are fancier than Newton's they nicely accommodate the matter that we have come to know and love matter that we can see touch feels smell and occasionally taste
NDGT-345||maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all but emanates from some other conceptual thing
NDGT-347||Knology for more than forty years combining his far-ranging insights into the cosmos with a colorful means of expression and an impressive ability to antagonize his colleagues
NDGT-352||Galaxy in which stars move in orbits they respond to the Gravity from all the other stars or in clusters of galaxies each Galaxy likewise feels the Gravity from all the other galaxies
NDGT-353||in this spirit I made a page of formulas in his notebook Einstein wrote a rhyme more ringing Lee in German than in this English translation in honor of Isaac Newton
NDGT-354||look unto the Stars to teach us how the Masters thoughts can reach us each one follows Newton's math silently along its path
NDGT-355||when we examine the coma cluster as Wiki did during the 1930s refine that its member galaxies are all moving more rapidly than the escape velocity for the cluster
NDGT-356||constitutes swiftly fly apart leaving barely a trace of its beehive existence after just a few hundred million years had passed but the cluster is more than 10 billion years old which is nearly as old as the universe is
NDGT-357||and so was born what Remains the longest-standing Unsolved Mystery in astrophysics
NDGT-358||across the decades that followed sawicki's work other galaxies clusters revealed the same problem so coma cannot be blamed for being peculiar
NDGT-359||then what or who should we blame Newton but I wouldn't not just yet his theories have been examined for 250 years and passed all tests
NDGT-361||today we've settled on the moniker dark matter which makes no assertion that anything's missing yet nonetheless implies that some new kind of
NDGT-362||matter must exist waiting to be discovered
NDGT-363||Justice astrophysicists had come to accept dark matter in Galaxy clusters of the mysterious thing the problem reared its invisible head once again
NDGT-364||in 1976 the lake Vera Rubin and astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington discovered a similar mass anomaly within spiral galaxies themselves
NDGT-366||beyond the Galaxy's luminous disk however what can still find some isolated gas clouds in a few bright stars using these objects as tracers of the gravity field exterior to the most luminous parts of the Galaxy
NDGT-368||Ruben correctly reasoned that some form of Dark Matter must lie in these far out regions well beyond visible Edge Beach spiral galaxy
NDGT-369||thanks to Ruben's work we now call these mysterious zones Dark Matter halos
NDGT-371||Across the Universe the discrepancy average is 2 a factor of 6 Cosmic dark matter has about six times the total gravity of all the visible matter
NDGT-372||further research has revealed that the Dark Matter cannot consist of ordinary matter that happens to be under a luminous or non luminous
NDGT-373||this conclusion rests on two lines of reasoning first we can eliminate with near certainty all plausible familiar candidate like the suspects in a police lineup
NDGT-374||could the Dark Matter reside in black holes no we think that we would have detected this many black holes from the gravitational effects on nearby Stars
NDGT-375||could it be dark clouds know they would have absorbed or otherwise interact with light from stars behind them which Bonafide dark matter doesn't do
NDGT-376||could it be Interstellar or Intergalactic rogue planets asteroids and comets all of which produce no light of their own it's hard to believe that the
NDGT-378||together these numbers provide a cosmic fingerprint left behind by the early Universe to a close approximation nuclear fusion during the first few minutes after the big bang Left Behind 1 helium nucleus for every 10 hydrogen nuclei
NDGT-379||which are themselves simply protons calculations show that if most of the Dark Matter had involved itself in nuclear fusion that would be much more helium relative to hydrogen in the universe
NDGT-380||from this we conclude that most of the dark
NDGT-381||hence most of the mass in the universe
NDGT-382||does not participate in nuclear fusion which disqualifies it is ordinary matter whose Essence lies in its willingness to participate in the atomic and nuclear forces that shape matter as we know it
NDGT-383||detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background which allow a separate test of this conclusion verify the result
NDGT-384||dark matter and nuclear fusion don't mix
NDGT-386||of course we are hamstrung in this analysis by not knowing what dark matter is in the first place
NDGT-387||if all mass has gravity does all gravity have mass we don't know
NDGT-388||maybe there's nothing the matter with the matter
NDGT-389||and it's the gravity we don't understand the discrepancy between dark and ordinary matter very significantly from one astrophysical environment to another but becomes more pronounced per large entities such as galaxies and Galaxy clusters
NDGT-391||but as we've already seen we do need it to explain the Motions of the Stars around the center of the Galaxy
NDGT-392||does a different kind of gravitational physics operate on a galactic scale probably not more likely Dark Matter consists of matter whose nature we have yet to Divine and which gathers more diffusely than ordinary
NDGT-393||how does otherwise we would detect the gravity of concentrated chunks of Dark Matter dotting the universe Dark Matter comment Dark Matter planets Dark Matter galaxies as far as we can tell that's not the way things are
NDGT-395||during the first half million years after the big bang Amir I blank in the 14 billion years sweep of cosmic history
NDGT-396||matter in the universe that already begun to coalesce into the blobs that would become clusters and superclusters of galaxies
NDGT-397||what the cosmos with double in size during its next half million years and continue growing after that
NDGT-399||how much gravity from Dark Matter did it need six times as much as that provided by ordinary matter itself
NDGT-400||just the amount we measure in the universe this analysis doesn't tell us what dark matter is only that Dark Matters effects are real and that try as you might you cannot credit ordinary matter for it
NDGT-401||so dark matter is our Frenemy we have no clue what it is it's kind of annoying but we desperately need
NDGT-402||calculation to arrive at an accurate description of the universe
NDGT-404||at the time the best ideas included the retrospectively laughable suggestion that the sun was a burning lump of coal
NDGT-405||also in the 19th century we observe Stars obtain their Spectra and classified them long before the 20th century introduction of quantum physics with kids at our understanding of how and why these Spectra look the way they do
NDGT-406||unrelenting Skeptics might compare the dark-matter of today to the hypothetical now-defunct ether
NDGT-407||proposed in the 19th century as the weightless transparent medium permeating the vacuum of space through which light move
NDGT-408||Attila famous 1887 experiments in Cleveland showed otherwise performed by Albert Michelson in Deadwood Morley at Case Western Reserve University scientist asserted that The Ether must exist even though not a shred of evidence supported this presumption
NDGT-409||as a wave-like was f*** to require a medium through which to propagate its energy much as sound requires air or some other substance to transmit its waves but light turned out to be quite happy traveling through the vacuum of space devoid of any medium to carry it
NDGT-410||unlike sound waves which consist of air vibrations light waves were found to be self-propagating packets of energy requiring no assistance at all
NDGT-411||Dark Matter ignorance difference fundamentally from ether ignorance The Ether was a placeholder for incomplete understanding whereas the existence of
NDGT-414||but is it any more crazy than the first suggestion that Earth orbits the Sun that
NDGT-415||sun is one of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way Or that the Milky Way is but one of a hundred billion galaxies in the universe
NDGT-416||even if any of these Fantastical accounts proved true none of it would change the successful invocation of Dark Matters gravity in the equations that we used to understand the formation and evolution of the universe
NDGT-417||other unrelenting Skeptics might declare that seeing is believing
NDGT-419||having resisted attempt to detected directly on Earth for three-quarters of a century Dark Matter remains and play
NDGT-420||particle physicists are confident that dark matter consists of a ghostly class of undiscovered particles that interact with matter by a gravity but otherwise interact with matter or light only weakly or not at all
NDGT-423||even though they interact extremely weekly with ordinary matter the copious Flux Of neutrinos from the Sun to neutrinos for every helium nucleus fuse from hydrogen in the sun's thermonuclear core
NDGT-425||in spite of this elusive Ade neutrinos are none-the-less stoppable under special circumstances and you can stop a particle at all you've detected it
NDGT-426||Dark Matter particles May reveal themselves through similarly rare interactions or more amazingly they might manifest by a forces other than the strong nuclear force weak nuclear force and electromagnetism
NDGT-429||as we've known from the beginning Dark Matter does indeed exert gravity to which order
NDGT-430||Ramada respond but that's it after all these years we haven't discovered it doing anything else
NDGT-431||for now we must remain content to carry dark-matter along as a strange and visible friend invoking it where and when the universe requires it of us
NDGT-432||chapter 6.
NDGT-433||as if you didn't have enough to worry about the universe in recent decades was discovered two-wheeled a mysterious pressure that you choose fourth from the vacuum of space and that acts opposite Cosmic gravity
NDGT-434||not only that this negative gravity will ultimately win the tug of war as it forces the cosmic expansion to accelerate exponentially into the future
NDGT-435||where the most mind-warping ideas in 20 Century physics just blame Einstein
NDGT-436||Albert Einstein hardly ever set foot in the laboratory he didn't test
NDGT-437||Dominator use elaborate equipment you was a theorist who perfected the thought experiment in which you engage nature through your imagination by inventing a situation or model and then working out the consequences of some physical principle
NDGT-439||observers and experimentalists can then go out and look for the phenomena and predicted by that model
NDGT-440||the model is flawed worth it serious to make a mistake and there calculation The Observers will uncover a mismatch between the models predictions and the
NDGT-441||things happen in the real universe that's the first Q for a cirrus to return to the proverbial drawing board by either adjusting the old model or creating a new one
NDGT-442||one of the most powerful and far-reaching theoretical models ever devised already introduced in these pages is Einstein's general theory of relativity
NDGT-447||yes Einstein was a badass
NDGT-449||the orbit the sun part was correct and a major advance in the earth-based geocentric universe but
NDGT-450||Circle part turn out to be a bit off all planets orbit the Sun in flattened circles called ellipses and even that shape is just an approximation of a more complex trajectory
NDGT-451||copernicus's basic idea was correct and that's What mattered most it's simply required some tweaking to make it more accurate
NDGT-453||indeed upon learning of a 1931 book entitled 100 authors against Einstein he responded that if he were wrong and only one would have been enough
NDGT-454||Varian were sown the seed of one of the most fascinating blunders in the history of science Einstein's new equation to gravity included a term he called the cosmological constant
NDGT-455||which he represented by the capital Greek letter Lambda
NDGT-456||a mathematically permitted but optional term the cosmological constant allowed him to represent a static universe
NDGT-458||Einstein invented the universe that neither expands nor contracts consistent with everybody's expectations at the time
NDGT-460||once on its sharpened Point Einstein's Universe was precariously perched between a state of expansion and total collapse
NDGT-461||moreover Einstein's theory was new and just because you give something a name does not make it real Einstein knew that Lambda as a negative gravity force of nature had no known counterpart in the physical universe
NDGT-463||in other words concentrations of mask cause Distortion dimples really in the fabric of space and time
NDGT-464||these distortions guide the moving masses
NDGT-465||StraightLine geodesics the shortest distance between two points on a Surface though they look to us like the current trajectories we call Orbitz
NDGT-466||the 20th century American theoretical physicist John Archibald wheeler said it best summon up Einstein's concept as matter tell space how to curve space tells matter how to move
NDGT-468||Lambda preserved what Einstein and every other physicists of his day that strongly presume to be true the status quo of a static universe
NDGT-469||unstable static Universe to invoke an unstable condition as the natural state
NDGT-470||physical system Violet scientific we do you cannot assert that the entire universe is a special case that happens to be balanced forever and ever
NDGT-471||nothing ever seen measured or imagined has behaved this way in the history of science which makes for powerful president
NDGT-472||13 years later in 1929 the American astrophysicists Edwin P Hubble discovered that the universe is not static he is found and assembled convincing evidence that the more distant galaxies the faster the galaxies receives from the Milky Way
NDGT-473||in other words the universe is expanding
NDGT-475||this example assume a equals B plus C if you learned later that a equals 10
NDGT-477||69 years later in 1998 science exhumed Lander one last time
NDGT-480||the Supernova is used in Pro Motors and Schmidt studies are worth their weight in Fusion double nuclei
NDGT-481||within certain limits each of those Stars explodes the same way igniting the same amount of fuel releasing the same Titanic amount of energy in the same amount of time
NDGT-482||thereby reaching the same Peak Luminosity thus they serve as a kind of yardstick or standard candle for calculating Cosmic distances to the galaxies in which they explode out to the farthest reaches of the universe
NDGT-484||all fine but is a second way to measure the distance to the galaxies their speed of recession from the Milky Way recession that's part and parcel of the overall Cosmic expansion
NDGT-485||as hook but was the first to show the expanding Universe makes a distant object race away from us faster than nearby ones so by measuring a Galaxy speed of recession another simple task what can deduce a Galaxy's distance
NDGT-486||if those two well-tested methods give different distances for the same object something must be wrong
NDGT-487||either the supernova's or bad standard candles or a model for the rate of cosmic expansion as measured by Galaxy Speed is wrong
NDGT-489||it was the first direct evidence that a repulsive Force permeated the universe opposing gravity which is how and why the cosmological constant rose from the dead
NDGT-491||the most accurate measurements to date revealed dark energy as the most prominent thing in town currently responsible for 68% of all the mass energy in the universe
NDGT-492||Dark Matter comprises 27% with regular matter comprising a mere 5%
NDGT-493||the shape of our four-dimensional universe comes from the relationship between the amount of matter
NDGT-494||energy that lives in the cosmos and the rate at which the cosmos is expanding
NDGT-496||notice the critical density you get Omega
NDGT-498||if Omega equals one Universe expands forever but only barely so
NDGT-499||in that case the shape is flat preserving all the geometric rules we learned in high school about
NDGT-500||the Lions will make it exceeded one parallel lines converge and the universe curve back on itself ultimately re collapsing into the fireball whence it came
NDGT-502||as far as observers were concerned the universe was open for business riding a one-way saddle into the future
NDGT-506||observers were at a loss and the theorist answered keep looking
NDGT-507||both camps were sure the other was wrong until the discovery of dark energy that's single-component when added to the ordinary matter and the ordinary energy and dark matter raise the mass energy density of the universe to the critical level
NDGT-508||simultaneously satisfied both The Observers and the theorist For the First Time The theorists and observers kissed and made up
NDGT-510||nobody had foreseen the dominating presence of cosmic Dark Energy nor had anybody imagined it as the great reconciler rib differences
NDGT-512||a virtual particle exert a little bit about pressure at it ever so briefly elbows its way into space
NDGT-513||unfortunately when you estimate the amount of repulsive vacuum pressure that rises from the abbreviated lives of virtual particles the result is more than 10 to the power 120 times larger than the experimental e determine
NDGT-514||value of the cosmological constant this is a stupid lie large Factor leading to the biggest mismatch between Theory and observation in the history of science
NDGT-515||yes we are clueless but it's not abject cluelessness
NDGT-517||and the Hunt is on now that we know dark energies real teams of astrophysicists have begun ambitious programmed to measure distances in the growth of structure in the universe using
NDGT-519||do we need an alternative to gr does a marriage of gr and quantum mechanics require an overhaul or is there some Siri of dark energy that awaits Discovery by a clever person yet to be born
NDGT-521||endless and exponential acceleration of the cosmic expansion as a consequence anything not gravitationally bound to the neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy we were seat at ever increasing speed as part of the accelerating expansion of the fabric of space-time
NDGT-524||darkness in the face of the deep
NDGT-526||behold my recurring nightmare are we to missing some basic pieces of the universe that once were
NDGT-527||what part of the cosmic history book has been Market access denied what remains absent from our theories and equation that want to be there leaving us groping for answers we may never find
NDGT-529||the Cosmos on the table trivia questions sometimes required deep and expansive knowledge of the cosmos just to answer them
NDGT-531||but in this case do you actually need to know the origin and evolution of the universe to answer the question
NDGT-533||for men either Periodic Table of chemical elements is I forgot
NDGT-535||or how about hydrogen then oxygen one is an explosive gas in the other promotes violent combustion yet the two combined make liquid water which put out fires
NDGT-536||amid these chemical confabulations we find element significant to the cosmos allowing me to offer the periodic table as viewed through the lens of an astrophysicist
NDGT-538||hydrogen in the core of the mass of planet Jupiter is under so much pressure that behaves more like a conductive metal than a gas creating the strongest magnetic field among the planets
NDGT-539||the English chemist Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen in 1766 during his experiments with H2O
NDGT-540||hydrogenous is Greek for water forming but he's best known among astrophysicists as the first to calculate Earth's mass after having measured inaccurate value for Big G the gravitational constant in Newton's famous equation
NDGT-541||every second of every day 4.5 billion tons of fast-moving hydrogen nuclei are turned into energy as they slam together to make helium within the 15 million degree core of the Sun
NDGT-542||helium is widely recognized as an over-the-counter low density gas that went inhale temporarily increases the vibrational frequency of your windpipe and larynx making you sound like Mickey Mouse
NDGT-543||helium is the second simplest and second most abundant element in the universe
NDGT-545||since the thermonuclear Fusion of hydrogen within Stars give you helium some regions of the cosmos could easily accumulate more than their 10% share of the stuff but as predicted no one has ever found a region of the Galaxy with less
NDGT-546||some 30 years before it was discovered an isolated on Earth astronomers detected helium in the spectrum of the sun's Corona during the total eclipse of 1868
NDGT-547||as noted earlier the name helium was duly derive from Helios the Greek sun god and with 92% of hydrogen buoyancy and are but without its explosive character is
NDGT-548||helium is the gas of choice for the outside balloon characters of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade making the department store second only to the US military as the nation's top user of the element
NDGT-550||another prediction of big bang cosmology is that we can expect no more than 1% of the atoms in any region of the universe to be lithium
NDGT-551||no one has yet found a galaxy with more lithium than this upper limits applied by The Big Bang the combination of helium's upper limit and lithium's lower limit gives us a potent dual can strength on tests for Big Bang cosmology
NDGT-553||just edging out carbon in abundance rank oxygen is common to forged and released in the remains of exploded stars both oxygen and carbon are major ingredients of Life as We Know It
NDGT-554||but what about life as we don't know it how about life based on the element silicon silicon sits directly below Carbon on the periodic table which means and principal it can create the same portfolio of molecules that carbon does
NDGT-555||in the end we expect carbon to win because it's ten times more abundant than silicon in the cosmos but that doesn't stop science fiction writers to keep XO by
NDGT-556||just on their toes wondering what the first truly alien silicon-based life-forms would be like
NDGT-559||in a model of cooperation the entire city of Tucson Arizona the nearest large municipality to the Kitt Peak National Observatory as by agreement with the local astrophysicists converted all the street lights to
NDGT-561||I bet most old people you know still call it tin foil
NDGT-562||polished aluminum makes a near-perfect reflector of visible light and is the coding of choice for nearly all telescope mirrors today
NDGT-565||the Spectre of red stars are riddled with features traceable to Titanium oxide which itself is no stranger to stars on Earth Star Sapphires and rubies do their radiant asterisms to Titanium oxide impurities in their crystal lattice
NDGT-566||furthermore the white paint used for telescope domed features titanium oxide which happens to be highly reflective in the infrared part of the spectrum greatly reducing the heat accumulated from sunlight in the air surrounding the telescope
NDGT-567||at nightfall with the Dome open the air temperature near the telescope rapidly equals the temperature of the nighttime are allowing light from stars and other Cosmic object to be
NDGT-568||I've been clear and well not directly name for a cosmetology act titanium derives from the Titans in Greek mythology Titan is Saturn's largest moon
NDGT-569||I'm any measures iron ranks as the most important element in the universe
NDGT-570||massive stars manufacture elements in their core in sequence from Helium to carbon to oxygen to nitrogen and so forth all the way up to periodic table to iron
NDGT-572||they are nearing death without a fertile source of energy the star collapses under its own weight instantly Rebound in a stupendous Supernova explosion outshining a billion Suns for more than a week
NDGT-574||100-ton underground vat of liquid gallium chloride is monitor for any collisions between neutrinos and gallium nuclei
NDGT-575||for every successful slam Galleon temporarily becomes germanium so germanium eventually decays back into gallium emitting a detectable pulse of x-rays
NDGT-576||long-standing problems with fewer solar neutrinos were detected than predicted by solar theory was solved using telescopes such as this
NDGT-577||every form of the element technetium is radioactive
NDGT-578||not surprisingly it's found nowhere on earth except a nuclear reactors and particle accelerators where we make it on demand
NDGT-580||in other words the start cannot have been born with this stuff for if it were they would be none left
NDGT-581||now there's also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and haven't dredge itself up to the surface weird is observed which is led to Exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community
NDGT-582||along with osmium in platinum-iridium is one of the three heaviest dances elements on the table two cubic ft of it weighs as much as a Buick
NDGT-585||I don't know how Albert would have felt about this but an unknown element was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb test in the enewetak atoll in the South Pacific on November 1st 1952 and was named Einsteinium in his honor
NDGT-586||I might have named it armagideon instead
NDGT-587||meanwhile 10 entries in the periodic table get their names from objects that orbit the Sun
NDGT-588||phosphorus comes from the Greek for light-bearing and was the ancient name for the planet Venus when it appeared Before Sunrise in the dawn sky
NDGT-589||selenium comes from Selene which is Greek for the moon named so because in Orr's it was always associated with the element tellurium which had already been named for Earth from the Latin Telos
NDGT-590||on January 1st 1801 the Italian astronomer Giuseppe p.oxy discovered a new planet orbiting the Sun in the suspiciously large gap between Mars and Jupiter
NDGT-591||keeping with the tradition of naming planets after Roman gods the object was named series after the goddess of agriculture in grains series is of course the root of the word cereal
NDGT-592||at the time it was sufficient excitement in the scientific Community for the first element discovered after this date to be named cerium in its honor
NDGT-593||two years later another planet was discovered orbiting the Sun in the same Gap as Series this one was named Palace after the goddess of wisdom how is
NDGT-594||and like Syrian before it the first element discovered thereafter was named Palladium in its honor
NDGT-596||the metal mercury liquid and running at room temperature and the planet Mercury the fastest of all planets in the solar system are both named for the Speedy Roman messenger god of the same name
NDGT-597||thorium is named for Thor
NDGT-601||with 92 protons packed in its nucleus uranium
NDGT-602||widely described is the largest naturally occurring element although Trace Amounts of larger elements can be found naturally with uranium ore is mine
NDGT-603||if you're innocent deserved an element named in its honor and then so did Neptune
NDGT-605||the Berkeley cyclotron discovered or manufactured many elements not found in nature including plutonium which directly follows neptunium in the table and was named for Pluto which Clyde Tombaugh discover
NDGT-606||Arizona's Lowell Observatory in 1930
NDGT-608||that's our attempts to measure Pluto's eyes became more and more refined Pluto kept getting smaller and smaller
NDGT-610||and like the asteroid hundred more object were later discovered in the outer solar system with orbits similar to that of Pluto signaling the end of Pluto's tenure as a planet and the revelation of a heretofore undocumented
NDGT-611||reservoir of small icy bodies called the Kuiper belt of comets to wish Pluto belongs in this regard one could argue that series Palace and Pluto slipped into the periodic table under false pretenses
NDGT-613||5 times as long if we ran a nuclear fuel instead of grocery store food
NDGT-614||so end our Cosmic Journey Through the periodic table of elements right to the edge of the solar system and beyond
NDGT-615||the reasons I've yet to understand men people don't like chemicals which might explain the perennial movement to rid foods of them
NDGT-616||perhaps sesquipedalian chemical names just sound dangerous but in that case we should blame the chemists and not the chemicals themselves
NDGT-617||personally I'm quite comfortable with chemicals anywhere in the universe my favorite stars as well as my best friend are all made of them
NDGT-618||chapter 8 on being round
NDGT-619||apartment crystals in broken rocks not much else in the cosmos naturally comes with sharp angles
NDGT-620||what many objects have peculiar shapes the list of round
NDGT-621||things is practically ambulas in ranges from simple soap bubbles to the entire observable universe
NDGT-622||all shapes spheres are favored by the action of simple physical laws
NDGT-623||so prevalent is this tendency that often we assume something is Farrah k'lon a mental experiment just to glean basic Insight even when we know that the object is decidedly non-spherical
NDGT-624||in short if you do not understand the spherical case then you cannot claim to understand the basic physics of the object
NDGT-626||this makes the strongest possible bubble because the Soapy film will not have to be spread any thinner than is absolutely
NDGT-627||necessary using freshman-level calculus you can show that the one and only shape that has the smallest surface area for an enclosed volume is a perfect sphere
NDGT-628||in fact billions of dollars could be saved annually on packaging material it's all shipping boxes and all packages of food in the supermarket we're spheres
NDGT-629||for example the contents of a super jumbo box of Cheerios with fit easily into a spherical carton with a four and a half inch radius
NDGT-630||but practical matters Prevail nobody wants to chase packaged-food down the aisle after it rolls off the shelves
NDGT-632||is weightless you gently squirt out precise quantities of molten metal and you have all the time you need the beads just float there while they cool until they Harden as perfect spheres with surface tension doing all the work for you
NDGT-633||large Cosmic object energy and gravity conspire to turn objects into spheres gravity is the force that serves to collapse matter in all directions but gravity does not always win
NDGT-634||chemical bonds of solid objects are strong
NDGT-635||the Himalayas grew against the force of Earth gravity because of the resilience of crustal Rock
NDGT-637||as a cosmic object is remarkably smooth
NDGT-638||if you had a super duper jumbo gigantic finger and you drag it across Earth's surface oceans and all
NDGT-639||Earth would feel as smooth as a cue ball
NDGT-640||expensive globes that portray raised portions of Earth's land masses to indicate mountain ranges are gross exaggerations of reality
NDGT-641||this is why in spite of Earth's mountains and valleys as well as being slightly flattened from pole to pole when viewed from space Earth is indistinguishable from a perfect sphere
NDGT-642||Ritz mountains are also QT when compared with some other mountains in the solar system
NDGT-643||the largest of Mars Olympus Mons is 65000 ft tall and nearly three hundred miles wide at its base it makes the highest of Earth mountains look like molehills
NDGT-644||the cosmic mountain-building recipe is simple the weaker the gravity on the surface of an object
NDGT-645||Pirates mountains can reach Mount Everest is about as tall as a mountain on Earth can grow before the Lower Rock layers to come to their own plasticity under the mountains weight
NDGT-646||object has low enough surface gravity chemical bonds and its rocks who resist the force of their own weight
NDGT-647||when this happens almost any shape as possible
NDGT-648||two famous Celestial non spheres are Phobos and Deimos the Idaho Potato shaped moons of Mars
NDGT-649||on 13 Mile Long Phobos the bigger of the two moons and average person would weigh the same as about five french fries
NDGT-650||in space surface tension always forces a small blob of liquid to form a sphere whenever you see a small solid object that is suspiciously spherical you can assume it formed in a molten state
NDGT-651||if the blob has very high mass then it could be composed of almost anything and gravity will ensure
NDGT-652||forms of fear big and massive Blobs of gas in the Galaxy can coalesce to form near-perfect gaseous spheres called Stars
NDGT-653||what if a star find itself orbiting too close to another object whose gravity is significant the spherical shape can be distorted as its material gets Stripped Away
NDGT-654||B too close I mean too close to the objects rocheleau
NDGT-655||named for the mid-nineteenth century mathematician Aur Roche who made detailed studies of gravity field in the vicinity of double Stars
NDGT-656||the Roche lobe is a theoretical dumb-bell-shaped bulbous double envelope that surrounds any two objects and mutual orbit
NDGT-657||if gaseous material from one object passes out of its own envelope than the material will fall towards the second object
NDGT-658||this occurrence is common among binary Stars when one of them swells to become a red giant and overfill its rocheleau
NDGT-659||the red giant distorts into a distinctly non spherical shape that resembles an elongated Hershey's kiss
NDGT-661||the stars of the Milky Way galaxy trace a big flat circle with a diameter 2 thickness ratio of 100 to 1
NDGT-662||our galaxy is flatter than the flattest Flapjacks ever made
NDGT-663||in fact it's proportions are better represented by a crepe or tortilla
NDGT-664||no the Milky Way's disk is not a sphere but it probably began as one
NDGT-665||we can understand the flatness by assuming the Galaxy was once a big spiracle
NDGT-666||slowly rotating ball of collapsing gas
NDGT-667||during the collapse the ball spun faster and faster just a spinning figure skaters do when they draw their arms inwards to increase their rotation rate
NDGT-668||the Galaxy naturally flatten pole-to-pole while the increasing centrifugal forces in the middle prevented collapse at midplane
NDGT-669||yes if the Pillsbury Doughboy were figure skater then fast spins would be a high-risk activity
NDGT-671||the current Milky Way which is neither collapsing nor expanding is it gravitationally mature system where one can think of the orbiting Stars
NDGT-672||above and below the disc as the skeletal remains of the original spherical gas cloud
NDGT-673||this General flattening of object that rotate is white Earth pole to pole diameter is smaller than its diameter at the equator
NDGT-674||not by much sweet chance of 1% about 26 MI
NDGT-675||but it's a small mostly solid and doesn't rotate all that fast at 24 hours per day carries anything on its equator at a mere 1,000 mph
NDGT-676||consider the jumbo fast rotating gaseous planet Saturn completing a day in just ten and a half hours its equator revolved at 22000 miles per hour and it's pole-to-pole Dimension is a fool 10% flatter than its middle
NDGT-677||a difference noticeable even through a small amateur telescope
NDGT-678||flattened spheres are more generally called oblate spheroid well spheres that are elongated pole to pole or called Crow Lake
NDGT-679||in everyday life hamburgers and hotdogs make excellent although somewhat extreme examples of each shape I don't know about you but the planet Saturn pops into my mind with every bite of a hamburger I take
NDGT-680||we use the effect of centrifugal forces on matter to offer insight into the rotation rate of extreme Cosmic objects
NDGT-682||two picture Pulsar imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan
NDGT-683||if that's hard to do then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a billion elephants
NDGT-685||under such conditions a neutron stars mountain range can be any taller than the thickness of a sheet of paper for you to exert more energy climbing it than a rock climber on Earth would exert ascending a 3000 mile high cliff
NDGT-686||in short where gravity is high the high places tend to fall filling in the Low Places of phenomena it sounds almost biblical in preparing the way for the Lord
NDGT-687||every Valley shall be raised up every mountain and Hill made love the rough ground shall be made level the rugged places a plane
NDGT-688||Isaiah chapter 40 verse 4
NDGT-689||that's a recipe for a sphere if there ever was one for all these reasons we expect pulsars to be the most perfectly shaped spheres in the universe
NDGT-690||for Rich clusters of galaxies the overall shape can offer deep astrophysical inside
NDGT-691||summer raggedy others are stretched thin and filaments yet others form vast sheets none of these have settled into a stable spherical gravitational shape
NDGT-693||but other systems such as the beautiful coma cluster of galaxies which we met in our chapter on Dark Matter tell this immediately
NDGT-694||gravity has shaped the cluster into a sphere
NDGT-695||as a consequence you are as likely to find a galaxy moving in One Direction as in any other
NDGT-696||whatever this is true the cluster cannot be rotating all that fast otherwise we would see some flattening as we do in our own Milky Way
NDGT-697||the coma concert once again like the Milky Way is also gravitationally mature
NDGT-699||it's for these reasons the gravitationally relax systems make excellent probes of non luminous dark matter
NDGT-700||allow me to make an even stronger statement we're not for a relaxed systems the ubiquity of Dark Matter may have remained under
NDGT-701||covered to this day this fear to end all spheres the largest and most perfect of the mall is the entire observable universe
NDGT-702||in every direction we look galaxies received from us at speeds proportional to their distance as we saw in the first few chapters this is the famous signature of an expanding Universe discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929
NDGT-704||at this distance and Beyond light from all luminous object loses all its energy before reaching us
NDGT-705||the universe beyond the spherical Edge is dust rendered invisible and as far as We Know unknowable
NDGT-706||there's a variation of the ever-popular Multiverse idea in which the multiple universes that comprise it or not separate universes entirely but isolated non-interacting pockets of space within one continuous fabric of space-time
NDGT-707||like multiple ships at Sea far enough away from one another so that their circular Horizon the do not intersect
NDGT-708||as far as anyone ship is concerned without further data it's the only ship on the ocean if they all share the same body of water

NDGT-711||but it's the astrophysicists who says consider

NDGT-713||and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
NDGT-714||there are more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio didn't dreamt of in your philosophy
NDGT-715||Hamlet Act 1 Scene 5
NDGT-717||already an accomplished Observer Herschel had discovered the planet Uranus in 1781 and was now exploring the relation between sunlight color and Heat
NDGT-718||he began by placing a prism in the path of a Sunbeam nothing new there Sir Isaac Newton had done that bad
NDGT-719||the 1600 leading him to name the familiar seven colors of the visible spectrum red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
NDGT-721||well conducted experiments require a control a measurement where you expect no effect at all and we served as a kind of idiot check on what you were measuring
NDGT-722||free sample if you wonder what effect beer has on a tulip plant then also nurture second tulip plant identical to the first but give it water instead
NDGT-723||they both plants die if you killed them both and you can't blame the alcohol
NDGT-724||that's the value of a control sample Hershel knew this and latest thermometer outside of the spectrum adjacent to the read expecting to read no more than room temperature throughout the experiment
NDGT-725||that's not what happened the temperature of his control thermometer Rose even higher than in the red
NDGT-726||Herschel Road ican clued-up the full redfall still short of the maximum of heat which perhaps live even a little Beyond visible refraction
NDGT-727||in this case radiant heat will at least partly if not chiefly consists if I may be permitted the expression of invisible light
NDGT-728||that is to say of rays coming from the Sun that have such a momentum as to be unfit for vision
NDGT-729||holy s*** Herschel inadvertently discovered infrared light a brand new part of the spectrum found just below red reported in the first of it
NDGT-731||real women who discovered single-celled organisms a biological universe
NDGT-732||Herschel discovered a new band of light both hiding in plain sight
NDGT-733||other investigators immediately took up where Herschel left off in 1801 the German physicist and pharmacists Johann vilhelm Ritter found yet another band of invisible light
NDGT-735||what's beyond Violet ultraviolet better known today as you V
NDGT-737||modern civilization has definitely exploited each of these band for countless household and Industrial applications making them familiar to us all
NDGT-738||after the discovery of UV and IR skywatching didn't change overnight the first telescope designed to detect invisible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum wouldn't be built for 130 years
NDGT-739||that's well after radio waves X-rays and gamma rays have been discovered and well after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz and shown
NDGT-740||that's the only real difference among the various kinds of white is the frequency of the waves in each band
NDGT-741||in fact credit hurts for recognizing that there is such a thing as an electromagnetic spectrum in his honor the unit of frequency in Waves per second for anything that vibrates including sound has dually been named the Hertz
NDGT-742||mysteriously astrophysicists where B load make the connection between the Newfound invisible bands of light and the idea of building a telescope that might see those bands from cosmic sources
NDGT-743||delays in detector technology surely matter here but humorous must take some of the blame
NDGT-747||make an exploding star a supernova it's a cosmically common it's seriously high-energy event
NDGT-748||the generate prodigious quantities of x-rays
NDGT-749||sometime brutes to gamma rays and flashes of ultraviolet accompany the explosions and is never a shortage of visible light
NDGT-750||more me after the explosive gases cool the shock waves dissipate and the visible light Fades the Supernova Remnant keeps on shining in the infrared while pulsing and radio waves
NDGT-751||that's where pulsars come from the most reliable timekeepers in the universe
NDGT-752||most Stellar explosion take place in distant galaxies with a star with a blow-up within the Milky Way its death throes would be bright enough for everyone to see even without a telescope
NDGT-753||nobody on Earth saw the invisible x-rays or gamma rays from the last two Supernova spectaculars hosted by our galaxy
NDGT-754||one in 1572 and another in 1604 yet their wondrous visible light was widely reported
NDGT-756||what's a way around that problem is simple gather all observations of your object perhaps obtained by colleagues and multiple bands of light then assigned visible colors to Invisible bands of Interest creating one meta multiband image
NDGT-757||that's precisely what Jordy from the television series Star Trek the Next Generation season with that power of vision you miss nothing
NDGT-758||only after you identify the band of your Astro physical affection can you begin to think about the size of your mirror the materials you need to make it the shape and surface it must have and the kind of detector you will need
NDGT-759||x-ray wavelengths for example are extremely short so if you're accumulating them
NDGT-760||your mirror had better be super smooth less imperfections in the surface distort them
NDGT-761||but if you're Gathering long radio waves your mirror could be made of chicken wire that you've been with your hands because the irregularities in The Wire would be much smaller than the wavelengths or after
NDGT-762||of course you also want plenty of detail high-resolution so your mirror should be as big as you can afford to make it in the end your telescope must be much much wider than the wavelength of light you aim to detect
NDGT-763||and nowhere is this need more evident than in the construction of a radio telescope
NDGT-765||Tanglewood metal-framed secured with wooden crosses ports and flooring it turned in place like a merry-go-round but on Wheels built with spare parts for a Model T Ford
NDGT-766||jansky hit Tunes the hundred-foot-long contraption to a wavelength of about 15 me corresponding to a frequency of 20.5 MHz
NDGT-767||Jacquee's agenda on behalf of his employer Bell Telephone Laboratories was to study any hisses from earth-based radio sources that might contaminate terrestrial radio communications
NDGT-768||this greatly resembles the tasks that Bell Labs gave penzias and Wilson 35 years later to find microwave noise and they're receiver as we heard in chapter 3 which led to the discovery of the cosmic microwave background
NDGT-769||by spending a couple of years painstakingly tracking and timing the static is the registered in his jury-rigged antenna he had discovered that radio waves emanate not just from locals

NDGT-772||with that observation radio astronomy was born

NDGT-779||in 2016 it's called The 500 m a church spiracle radio telescope or fast for short

NDGT-784||one of them a very large array of radio dishes near Socorro New Mexico
NDGT-786||there's also the very long Baseline array with 10824 dishes Fanning 5,000 miles from Hawaii to the Virgin Island enabling the highest resolution of any radio telescope in the world
NDGT-787||in the microwave and relatively new to interferometers we've got the 66 and 10 is of Alma the Atacama large millimeter array in the remote Andes mountains of Northern Chile

NDGT-790||Alma's location is by intention the most arid landscape on Earth
NDGT-791||3 miles above sea level and well above the wettest clouds
NDGT-792||Warner may be fine for microwave cooking but it's bad for astrophysicists because the water vapor in Earth's atmosphere choose up pristine microwave signals from across the Galaxy and Beyond
NDGT-793||these two phenomena are of course related water is the most common ingredient in food and microwave ovens primarily heat water
NDGT-794||taken together you get the best indication that water absorbs microwave frequencies
NDGT-795||so if you want clean observations of cosmic object you must minimize the amount of water vapor between your telescope and the universe
NDGT-797||at the ultra short wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum you find the high frequency high-energy gamma rays with wavelength measured in picometers
NDGT-798||that's trillionths of a meter discovered in 1900 they were not detected from space until a new kind of telescope was placed aboard NASA's Explorer 11 satellite in 1961
NDGT-799||anybody who watches too many Sci-Fi movies knows that gamma rays are bad for you you might turn green and muscular or spiderwebs might squirt from your wrist but they're also hard to trap they pass right through ordinary lenses and mirrors
NDGT-800||Alvin to observe them guts of Explorer 11 telescope held a device called a scintillator which responds to incoming gamma-rays by pumping out electrically charged particles

NDGT-804||invoking the military eatock trust but verify the US deployed a new series of satellites the veil has to scan for gamma ray bursts that would result from Soviet nuclear tests
NDGT-808||the origin remains a bit of a mystery but the best explanation hold that in the electrical storm free electrons accelerate to near the speed of light and then slam into the nuclei of atmospheric atoms generating gamma rays
NDGT-809||today telescopes operate in every invisible part of this
NDGT-810||some from the ground but most from space where telescopes view is unimpeded by Earth's absorptive atmosphere
NDGT-811||we can now observe phenomena ranging from low-frequency radio waves it doesn't meters across Crest to Crest to high-frequency gamma rays no longer than a quadrillion 7 m

NDGT-822||chapter 10 between the planets
NDGT-823||from a distance our solar system looks empty
NDGT-824||if you enclosed it within a sphere one large enough to contain the orbit of Neptune the outermost Planet then the volume occupied by the sun all the planets and their moons would take up
NDGT-825||little more than one trillionth the enclosed space
NDGT-827||interplanetary space is so not empty that Earth during its 30 km/s orbital Journey plows through hundreds of tons of meteors per day
NDGT-828||most of them no larger than a grain of sand nearly all of them burn in Earth's upper atmosphere slamming into the air with so much energy that the debris vaporizes on contact
NDGT-829||our frail species evolved under this protective blanket
NDGT-830||larger golf ball-sized meteors heat fast but unevenly and often shatter into many smaller pieces before they vaporize
NDGT-831||still larger meteors scenes their surface but otherwise make it all the way to the ground intact
NDGT-832||you think that by now we have to 4.6 billion trips around the sun earth would have vacuumed up all possible debris and its orbital path
NDGT-833||but things were once much worse
NDGT-834||4/2 billion years after the formation of the Sun and its Planet so much junk rain down on Earth that heat from the persistent energy of impact rendered Earth's atmosphere hot and our crust Multan
NDGT-835||one substantial Hunter jump led to the formation of the Moon
NDGT-838||not only is the solar system scarred by the Flotsam of its formation but nearby interplanetary space also contains rocks of all sizes that would Jennison from Mars the Moon and Earth by the ground recoil from high-speed impact
NDGT-839||computer studies of meteor strikes demonstrate conclusively that surface rocks near impact zoned can get thrust upward with enough speed to escape the body's gravitational tether
NDGT-840||at the rate we're discovering meteorites on Earth whose origin is Mars we conclude that about 1,000 tons of Martian rocks
NDGT-841||rain down on Earth each year perhaps the same amount reaches Earth from the Moon
NDGT-842||in retrospect we didn't have to go to the Moon to retrieve moon rocks plenty come to us
NDGT-843||although they were not of our choosing and we didn't yet know it during the Apollo program
NDGT-844||most of the Solar System's asteroid live and work in the main asteroid belt a roughly flat zone between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
NDGT-846||sounds insignificant but accumulated perturbations of their orbit continually create a deadly subset perhaps a few thousand who's eccentric pad intersect Earth's orbit
NDGT-849||the dutch-born American astronomer Gerard Kuiper Advanced the idea that in the cold depths of space beyond the orbit of Neptune they reside Frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system
NDGT-850||without a massive Planet upon which to fall most of these comments will orbit the Sun for billions of
NDGT-851||as is true for the asteroid belt some objects of the Kuiper belt travel on eccentric pad that cross the orbits of other planets
NDGT-852||Pluto and its Ensemble of sibling called puccinos crossed Neptune's path around the Sun other Kuiper Belt objects plunge all the way down to the inner solar system Crossing planetary orbits with abandon
NDGT-853||this sucks that include Howie the most famous Comet of the mall

NDGT-858||if we had eyes that could see magnetic field Jupiter would look ten times larger than the full moon in the sky
NDGT-859||spacecraft at Jupiter must be designed to remain unaffected by this powerful force
NDGT-860||as the English physicist Michael Faraday demonstrated in the 1800 if you pass a wire across a magnetic field you generated voltage difference along the wires length
NDGT-862||last night kept count they were 56 moons among the planets in the Solar System
NDGT-863||then I woke up one morning to learn that another dozen had been discovered around Saturn
NDGT-864||after that incident I decided to no longer keep track all I care about now is whether any of them would be fun places to visit or to study
NDGT-865||by some measures the Solar System's moons are more fascinating than the planets they orbit
NDGT-866||Earth's moon is about 14 hundreds of diameter of the Sun but it's also one 400's far from us making the sun in the moon the same size on the sky
NDGT-867||a coincidence not shared by any other planet Moon combination in the solar system allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses
NDGT-868||also has tidally locked the moon leaving it with identical periods of rotation on its axis and revolution around Earth
NDGT-869||wherever and whenever this happened the locked Moon shows only one face to its host plan
NDGT-870||Jupiter system of moons is replete with eyeballs
NDGT-871||IO Jupiter's closest moon is tidally locked and structurally stressed by interactions with Jupiter and with other moons pumping enough heat into the little orb to render molten it interior rocks
NDGT-873||if ever there was a next best place to look for life it's here
NDGT-874||an artist co-worker mine once at whether alien life-forms from Europa would be called European
NDGT-875||the absence of any other plausible answer force me to say yes
NDGT-876||Pluto's largest moon Charon is so big and close to Pluto that Pluto and Charon
NDGT-877||each title Lee lock the other their rotation. And their periods our Revolution identical
NDGT-878||we call this a double tidal lock with sounds like a yet-to-be invented wrestling hold
NDGT-879||by convention moons are named for Greek Personalities in the life of the Greek counterpart to the Roman god after whom the planet itself was named
NDGT-880||the classical God LED complicated socialized so there's no shortage of characters from which to draw
NDGT-882||had Hershel succeeded the planet list would read Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn
NDGT-885||the sun loses material from its surface at a rate of more than a million tons per second
NDGT-886||we call this the solar wind which takes the form of high-energy charged particles
NDGT-889||Earth's atmosphere is commonly described as extending dozens of miles above Earth's surface
NDGT-890||satellites in low-earth orbit typically travel between 100 and 400 miles up completing an orbit in about 90 minutes while you can't breathe at those altitude some atmospheric molecules remain
NDGT-891||enough to slowly drain orbital energy from unsuspecting satellites
NDGT-892||to combat this drag satellites in low orbit require income it and boosts less they fall back to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere
NDGT-893||an alternative way to define the edge of our atmosphere is to ask we're its density of gas molecules equal
NDGT-894||the density of gas molecules in interplanetary space
NDGT-895||under that definition Earth's atmosphere extends thousands of miles
NDGT-897||with an orbit precisely matching the rotation rate of Earth these satellites appear to hover which makes them ideal for relaying signals from one part of Earth's surface to another
NDGT-898||Newton's Laws specifically state that while the gravity of a planet gets weaker and weaker the farther from it you travel there is no distance with a force of gravity reaches zero
NDGT-899||the planet Jupiter with his mighty gravitational field bat
NDGT-900||Harm's Way many comets that would otherwise wreak havoc on the inner solar system
NDGT-902||we have exploited the gravitational fields of planet for nearly every probe launched into space

NDGT-906||I'm now accountable for some of the Solar System's interplanetary debris
NDGT-907||in November 2000 the main belt asteroid 1994 Ka

NDGT-909||what I enjoyed the distinction there's no particular reason to get big-headed about it plenty of asteroids have familiar names so just Jody Harriet and Thomas there are even asteroids out there named Merlin James Bond and Santa
NDGT-910||now in the hundreds of thousand the asteroid count might soon challenge our capacity to name them
NDGT-911||whether or not that day arrives I take comfort knowing that my chunk of cosmic debris is not alone as it litters the space between the planets being joined by a long list of other chunks name for real and fictional people

NDGT-932||celebrated photograph taken in 1990 from just beyond Neptune's orbit by the Voyager 1 spacecraft shows just how underwhelming Earth looks from deep space a pale blue dot as the American astrophysicist Carl Sagan called
NDGT-933||and that's generous without the help of a caption you might not even know it's there
NDGT-934||what would happen if some big brain aliens from the great beyond scan the skies with are naturally superb visual organs further hated by alien state-of-the-art Optical accessories
NDGT-935||what visible features of planet Earth might they detect
NDGT-936||balloonist would be first and foremost water covers more than two-thirds of Earthsea
NDGT-937||the Pacific Ocean alone spans nearly an entire side of the planet
NDGT-938||any beings with enough equipment and expertise to detect our planets color would surely infer the presence of water the third most abundant molecule in the universe
NDGT-940||feelings Rosso see major weather system come and go
NDGT-941||with careful study they could readily distinguish features related to clouds in the atmosphere from features related to the surface of Earth itself
NDGT-942||time for a reality check the nearest exoplanet the nearest Planet in orbit around a star that is not the sun can be found in our neighbor star system Alpha Century about four light-years from us invisible mostly from our southern hemisphere
NDGT-943||most of the catalog exoplanet live from dozens of two hundreds of light-years away
NDGT-944||rightness is less than 1 billions that of the Sun and our planet proximity to the sun would make it extremely hard for anybody to see Earth directly with a visible light telescope
NDGT-945||play trying to detect the light of a firefly in the vicinity of a Hollywood Searchlight
NDGT-946||aliens have found us there likely looking in wavelength other than visible light like infrared where our brightness relative to the sun is it better then
NDGT-947||visible-light or else they're Engineers are adapting some other strategy altogether
NDGT-948||maybe they're doing what some of our own Planet Hunters typically do monitoring stars to see if they jiggle at regular intervals a star's periodic jiggle betrays the existence of an orbiting planet that maybe too dim to see directly
NDGT-949||contrary to what most people suppose a planet does not orbit its host star instead both the planet and its host star revolve around the Common Center of mass
NDGT-950||The more mass of the planet the larger the Stars response must be and the more measurable to jiggle gets when you analyze the Stars light
NDGT-951||unfortunately for planet-hunting aliens Earth is puny so the sun barely budges which would further challenge alien engineers
NDGT-952||NASA's Kepler Telescope design InTune to discover earth-like planets
NDGT-953||around sun-like Stars invoke yet another method of detection mightily adding to the exoplanet catalog
NDGT-954||Kepler search for stars whose total brightness dropped slightly and at regular intervals
NDGT-955||these cases Kepler's line-of-sight is just right to see a star get dimmer by a tiny fraction due to one of its own Planet Crossing directly in front of the host star
NDGT-956||with this method you can't see the planet itself
NDGT-957||you can't even see any features on the star's surface Kepler simply tracked changes in a star's Total light but added thousands of exoplanets to the catalog
NDGT-958||including hundreds of multi planet star systems
NDGT-959||from these data you also learn the size of the exoplanet its orbital. And its orbital distance from the host star
NDGT-960||you can always make an educated inference on the planet's mass if you're wondering when Earth passes in front of the sun which is always happening for some lineup
NDGT-961||vitamin Galaxy Wii block one ten-thousandth of the sun surface thereby briefly dimming the sun's Total light by one ten-thousandth of his normal brightness
NDGT-962||fine if it goes till discover the truth exists but learn nothing about happenings on Earth's surface
NDGT-963||radio waves in microwaves might work maybe are eavesdropping aliens have something like the 500 meter radio telescope in the Grillo province of China
NDGT-964||if they do if they tune to the right frequencies they'll certainly notice Earth or rather they'll notice our modern civilization as one of the most luminous sources in the sky
NDGT-968||maybe they wouldn't be able to distinguish Earth radio remission from those of the son forcing them to conclude that the sun is a new kind of odd radio intensive star
NDGT-969||astrophysicist right here on Earth at the University of Cambridge in England was similarly stumped back in 1967
NDGT-970||well surveying the skies with a radio telescope for
NDGT-971||a source of strong radio waves Anthony Huish and his team discovered something extremely odd
NDGT-972||an object pulsing imprecise repeating intervals of slightly more than a second
NDGT-973||Jocelyn Bell a graduate student a few wishes at the time was the first to notice it soon Bells colleagues established that the pulses came from a great distance
NDGT-974||the thought that the signal was technological another culture beaming evidence of its activities across space was irresistible
NDGT-975||asbell recounts we had no proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission
NDGT-976||he was I trying to get a PhD out of a new technique and some silly a lot of Little Green Men had to choose my aerial in my frequency to communicate with us
NDGT-977||within a few days however she discovered other repeating signals coming from other places and our Milky Way galaxy Bell and her Associates realized they discovered a new class of cosmic object a star made entirely of newt
NDGT-978||the pulses with radio waves for every rotation that executes Huish involve sensibly name them pulsars
NDGT-979||turns out intercepting radio wave isn't the only way to be Snoopy
NDGT-980||there's also cosmochemistry the chemical analysis of planetary atmosphere has become a lively field of modern astrophysics as you might guess Cosmo chemistry depends on spectroscopy the analysis of light by means of a spectrometer
NDGT-981||by exploiting the tools and tactics of spectroscopy list Cosmo chemist can infer the presence of Life on an exoplanet regardless of whether that life has sentience Intelligence or technology
NDGT-982||the method works because every element every molecule no matter where it exists in the universe absorbs emits reflects and scatters light in a unique way
NDGT-983||and as already discuss past that light through a spectrometer and you'll find feature that can rightly be called
NDGT-984||chemical fingerprints the most visible fingerprints are made by the chemicals most excited by the pressure and temperature of their environment
NDGT-987||that way the chemicals in Earth's atmosphere could interact with the light leaving there marks for
NDGT-988||to see some molecules ammonia carbon dioxide water show-up abundantly in the universe where the life is present or not
NDGT-989||but other molecules thrive in the presence of life itself
NDGT-990||another readily detected biomarker is there a sustained level the molecule methane
NDGT-991||two-thirds of which is produced by human related activities such as fuel oil production rice cultivation sewage and the burps and farts of domestic livestock
NDGT-992||natural sources comprising the remaining third include decomposing vegetation and wetlands and Termite influences
NDGT-994||if the aliens track our nighttime side while we orbit our host star they might notice a surge of sodium from our widespread use of sodium vapor lamps that switch on at dusk in urban and Suburban municipalities
NDGT-995||most telling however would be our free-floating oxygen would constitute a full fifth of our atmosphere
NDGT-996||oxygen which after hydrogen and helium is the third most abundant element in the cosmos is chemically active and bonds readily with atoms of hydrogen carbon nitrogen silicon sulfur iron and so on
NDGT-997||it even bonds with itself that's for oxygen to exist in a steady-state something must be liberated as fast as it's being consumed
NDGT-998||here on Earth The Liberation is traceable to life photosynthesis carried out by plants and many bacteria creates free oxygen in the oceans and in the atmosphere
NDGT-999||free oxygen intern enable the existence of
NDGT-1000||oxygen metabolizing life including us and practically every other creature in the animal kingdom
NDGT-1001||we are circling already know the significance of our planets distinctive chemical fingerprints but distant aliens who come upon it will have to interpret their findings and test their assumptions must a periodic appearance of sodium be techno Jenik
NDGT-1002||free oxygen is surely biogenic how about methane it to is chemically unstable and yes some of it is anthropogenic but as we've seen methane has nonliving agents as well
NDGT-1003||if all the aliens decide the Earth's chemical features are sure evidence of Life maybe it'll wonder if the life is intelligent
NDGT-1004||presumably the aliens communicate with one another and perhaps they'll presume that other intelligent life-forms communicate to maybe that's when they'll decide to eavesdrop on Earth with their radio telescope to see what part of the electromagnetic spectrum its inhabitants of Master
NDGT-1007||the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995 and as of this writing the tally is rising through 3000 most found in a small pocket of the Milky Way Around the solar system
NDGT-1008||stop this plenty more where they came from after all our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars in the known universe Harvest some hundred billion galaxies
NDGT-1009||our search for life in the universe drives the search for exoplanets some of which resemble Earth not detail of course but in overall properties
NDGT-1010||latest estimates extrapolating from the current catalogs suggest as many as forty billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way alone those are the planets out of descendants might want to visit someday

NDGT-1015||James Ferguson 1757
NDGT-1016||long before anyone knew that the Universe had a beginning before we knew that the nearest large Galaxy like 2 million light-years from Earth before we knew how Stars work or whether atoms exist
NDGT-1017||James Ferguson's enthusiastic introduction to his favorite science rang true
NDGT-1018||yet his words apart from their 18th century flourish could have been written yesterday
NDGT-1019||but who gets to think that way who gets to celebrate this Cosmic view of life
NDGT-1020||not the migrant Farm worker not the Sweatshop worker
NDGT-1021||certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food
NDGT-1023||yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost
NDGT-1024||when I travel thousands of miles to spend a few moments in the fast-moving shadow of the moon during a total solar eclipse
NDGT-1025||sometimes I lose side of earth when I pause and reflect on our expanding Universe with its galaxies hurdling away from one another embedded within the ever stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time
NDGT-1026||sometimes I forget that accounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter and that children are disproportionately represented among them
NDGT-1029||and well-being and sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves
NDGT-1030||I occasionally forget these things because however big the world is in our hearts our minds and our outside digital Maps the universe is even bigger
NDGT-1031||a depressing thought to some but a liberating thought to me
NDGT-1032||considered an adult tends to the traumas of a child
NDGT-1033||spilled milk a broken toy a scraped knee
NDGT-1034||as adults we know the kids have no clue of what constitutes a genuine problem because inexperience greatly limit their childhood perspective
NDGT-1035||children do not yet know that the world doesn't revolve around them
NDGT-1036||as grown-ups deer we admit to ourselves that we to have a collective immaturity of you dare we admit that our thought
NDGT-1037||and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us

NDGT-1052||try as they might primatologist will never get a chimpanzee to do long division or trigonometry

NDGT-1076||that being said we may not even be over this Earth simple separate lines at Reser
NDGT-1077||when considered together have forced investigators to reassess who we think we are and we we think we came from
NDGT-1078||as we've already seen what a large asteroid strikes a planet the surrounding areas can recoil from the impact energy catapulting rocks into space
NDGT-1079||from there they can travel to and land on other planetary surfaces

NDGT-1083||recent evidence suggests that shortly after the formation of our solar system Mars was wet and perhaps fertile even before Earth was
NDGT-1084||collectively these findings tell us it's conceivable that life began on Mars and later seeded life on earth a process known as panspermia

NDGT-1091||the cosmic perspective is humble the cosmic perspective is spiritual even Redemptive
NDGT-1092||but not religious the cosmic perspective enables us to grasp in the same thought the large and the small the cosmic perspective
NDGT-1094||the cosmic perspective shows Earth to be a moat

NDGT-1105||the continued success of Cosmos Carl Sagan's magnum opus argue strongly for Carl's affability and intelligence
NDGT-1106||but it also reveals a hidden hunger in us all to learn about our place in the universe and embrace why that matters intellectually culturally and emotionally
NDGT-1107||these properties distinguish the work of Carl Sagan and his collaborators from all other efforts to communicate science
NDGT-1108||most good books in the genre teach you what to know in the author's field of expertise what's hot what's interesting in clear and simple language but rarely is that information shaped into knowledge and even more rarely is that

NDGT-1113||when taken separately each of these fields is noble and time-honored but when taken together when Cosmos wove them into a tapestry of inside on our place in the universe their juxtaposition became potent and indelible
