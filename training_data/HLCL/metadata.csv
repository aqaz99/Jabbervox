HLCL-0|keep going if you are scared keep going
HLCL-1|if you are hungry keep going if you want to taste Freedom keep going
HLCL-2|Harriet Tubman authors note
HLCL-3|this is my story of what happened it's the story of what I saw felt and thought during two of the most intense years I've ever experienced
HLCL-4|it's a story of what led me to this Crossroads of American history and how I kept going after a shocking defeat
HLCL-5|how I reconnected with the things that matter most to me and began to look ahead with hope instead of backward with regret
HLCL-6|it's also the story of what happened to our country why we're so divided and what we can do about it
HLCL-7|I don't have all the answers and this isn't a comprehensive account of the 2016 race that's not for me to write
HLCL-8|I have two little distance and two great a steak in it
HLCL-9|instead this is my story I want to pull back the curtain on an experience that was exhilarating joyful humbling infuriating and just plain baffling
HLCL-10|writing this wasn't easy everyday that I was a candidate for president I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldn't bear the idea of letting them down
HLCL-11|but I did I couldn't get the job done and I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life
HLCL-12|in this book it's from the campaign I wish I could go back and do over if the Russians
HLCL-13|I also capture some moments I want to remember forever like when my tiny granddaughter raced into the room while I was practicing my convention speech and what it was like ours later to step on stage
HLCL-14|to deliver that speech as the first woman ever nominated by a major political party for president of the United States
HLCL-15|I write about people who inspired me from a minister and South Carolina talk with me about love and kindness to Residents who banded together in a town poisoned by lead
HLCL-16|the tireless campaign volunteers giving everything they had for a better future
HLCL-17|and I share my thoughts on big challenges I've grappled with four decades that have taken on new urgency such as the roles that gender race and class play in our politics and the importance of empathy in our national life
HLCL-18|I tried to learn from my own mistakes there are plenty as you'll see in this book and they are mine and mine alone
HLCL-19|but that's not the end of the story we can't understand what happened in 2016 without confronting the audacious information Warfare
HLCL-20|wage from the Kremlin precedented intervention in our election by the director of the FBI
HLCL-21|a political press that told voters that my emails were the most important story and deep currents of anger and resentment flowing through our culture
HLCL-22|I know some people don't want to hear about these things especially from me
HLCL-23|but we have to get this right the lessons we draw from 2016 could help determine whether we can heal our democracy and protected in the future and whether we as Citizens can begin to bridge our divides
HLCL-24|I want my grandchildren and all future generations to know what really happened we have a responsibility to history to a concerned world to set the record straight
HLCL-25|I also share with you the painful days that followed the election
HLCL-26|lot of people have asked me how did you even get out
HLCL-27|reading the news every morning was like ripping off a scab each new revelation and outrage made it worse
HLCL-28|it has been maddening to watch our country's standing in the world plummet and to see Americans live in fear that their Healthcare might be taken away so that the super-rich can get a tax cut
HLCL-29|there are times when all I want to do is Scream into a pillow
HLCL-30|but slowly on a personal level it has gotten better or at least less terrible
HLCL-31|I did quite a bit of thinking and writing some praying some stewing and in time a good deal of laughing
HLCL-32|I went on a lot of long walks in the woods with my husband and our dogs tally and Maisy who took this much better than we did
HLCL-33|I surrounded myself with friends and caught up on some of the shows that people have been telling me about four years as well as a lot of HD
HLCL-34|best of all I spent time with my wonderful grandchildren
HLCL-35|making up for all the bedtime stories and songs in the bathtub I missed during my long months on the campaign Trail
HLCL-36|I believe this is what some call self-care it turns out it's pretty great
HLCL-37|now when people ask how I'm doing I say that as an American I'm more worried than ever but as a person I'm doing okay
HLCL-38|this book is the story of that Journey riding it has been cathartic I got angry and sad all over again
HLCL-39|at times I've had to step away lie down close my eyes and try to empty my mind
HLCL-40|this book has been hard to write for another reason
HLCL-41|I've lost count of the number of times that I sat at my kitchen table working on these Pages been interrupted by a breaking news alert hung my head and sigh
HLCL-42|and then took out my red pan and started revising
HLCL-43|I tried to make my peace with painful memories and recapture some of the fun that's still more days on the campaign and you might think
HLCL-44|in the past four reasons that I try to explain I've often felt I had to be careful in public like I was up on a wire without a net
HLCL-45|now I'm letting down my guard by the time I finished writing I felt ready to face the future again I hope that by the end you'll be right there with me
HLCL-46|I will always be grateful to have been the Democratic party's nominee and to have earned 65844610 votes from my fellow Americans
HLCL-47|that number more votes than any candidate for president has ever received other than Barack Obama
HLCL-48|is proof that the ugliness we faked Easton 2016 does not define our country
HLCL-49|I want to thank everyone who welcomed me into their homes businesses schools and churches over those two long crazy years
HLCL-50|every little girl and boy who ran into my arms at full speed or high five me with all their might and a long chain of Brave adventurous people stretching back Generations who's love and strength made it possible for me to lead such a rewarding life in the country I love
HLCL-51|thanks to them despite everything else my heart is full
HLCL-52|I started this book with some words attributed to one of those Pat's Breakers Harriet Tubman
HLCL-53|20 years ago I watched a group of children perform a play about her life that her former Homestead in Auburn New York
HLCL-54|they were so excited about this courageous determined woman who led slaves to
HLCL-55|despite everything she faced she never lost her faith in a simple but powerful motto keep going
HLCL-56|that's what we have to do now to
HLCL-57|in 2016 the US government announced that Harriet Tubman will become the face of the $20 bill
HLCL-58|if you need proof that America can still get it right there it is
HLCL-59|it's supposed to be hard if it wasn't hard everyone would do it
HLCL-60|the heart is what makes it great A League of Their Own
HLCL-61|perseverance that which does not kill us makes us stronger
HLCL-62|Friedrich Nietzsche and Kelly Clarkson
HLCL-63|showing up deep breath feel the air fill my lungs
HLCL-64|this is the right thing to do the country needs to see that our democracy still works no matter how painful this is
HLCL-65|breathe out scream later
HLCL-66|I'm standing just inside the door at the top of the steps leading down to the inaugural platform waiting for the announcer to call Bill and me to our seats
HLCL-67|I'm imagining that I'm Anywhere But Here
HLCL-68|Maybe
HLCL-69|it's a tradition for Bill and me as a former president and first lady to attend the swearing-in of the new president
HLCL-70|I had struggled for weeks with whether or not to go
HLCL-71|John Lewis wasn't going the Civil Rights hero and Congressman said that the president-elect was not legitimate because of amount
HLCL-72|evidence of Russian interference in the election
HLCL-73|other members of Congress were joining him and boycotting a president-elect they saw as divisive
HLCL-74|a lot of my supporters and close friends urged me to stay home too
HLCL-75|my friends understood how painful it would be to sit on the platform and watch Donald Trump sworn in as our next commander and chief
HLCL-76|I had campaigned relentlessly to make sure that never happened
HLCL-77|I was convinced he represented a clear and present danger to the country and the world
HLCL-78|now the worst had happened and he was going to take the oath of office
HLCL-79|plus after the mean-spirited campaign Trump ran there was a decent chance I'd get booed or be met with lockherup chance if I went
HLCL-80|still I saw the responsibility to be there
HLCL-81|the peaceful transfer of power is one of our country's most important Traditions I had touted it around the world as Secretary of State hoping that more countries would follow our example
HLCL-82|if I really believed in it I had to put my feelings aside and go
HLCL-83|checked with the bushes Carter's to see what they were thinking
HLCL-84|George W and Jimmy had been among the first to call me after the election which meant a lot to me
HLCL-85|George actually called just minutes after I finished my concession speech and graciously waited on the line while I hugged my team and supporters one last time
HLCL-86|when we talked he suggested we find time to get burgers together
HLCL-87|I think that's taxon for I feel your pain
HLCL-88|both he and Jimmy knew what it felt like to put yourself on the line in front of the whole country and Jimmy knew the sting of rejection
HLCL-89|and I commiserated over that a bit Jimmy this is the worst
HLCL-90|yes Hillary it is it was no secret that these former presidents weren't fans of Donald Trump
HLCL-91|absolutely vicious to George's brother Jeb in particular
HLCL-92|but were they going to the inauguration yes
HLCL-93|that gave me the push I needed bill and I would go
HLCL-94|that's how I ended up right inside the door of the Capitol on January 20th waiting to be announced
HLCL-95|it had been such a long journey to get here
HLCL-96|now I just had to take a few more steps
HLCL-97|I took bills arm and squeezed it grateful to have him by my side
HLCL-98|I took a deep breath and walked out the door with as big a smile as I could muster
HLCL-99|on the platform we sat next to the bushes
HLCL-100|the four of us had caught up inside a few minutes earlier trading updates about our daughters and gray
HLCL-101|children we chatted like it was any other day
HLCL-102|George and Laura gave us the latest news about the health of George's parents former President George HW and Barbara
HLCL-103|both of whom had been in the hospital recently but happily we're now on the mend
HLCL-104|as we sat waiting for the president-elect to arrive my mind wander back to that incredible day 24 years earlier when Bill took the oath of office for the first time
HLCL-105|it could not have been easy for George h.w. and Barbara to watch
HLCL-106|but they had been extraordinarily gracious to us
HLCL-107|going president left a letter for Bill in the Oval Office that is one of the most decent and patriotic things I've ever read
HLCL-108|your success now is our country's success
HLCL-109|I am rooting hard for you he wrote we did our best to show the same graciousness to George W and Laura 8 years later
HLCL-110|at this moment I was trying to summon a similar attitude about the incoming president
HLCL-111|as I had said in my concession speech he deserves an open mind and the chance to lead
HLCL-112|I also thought about Al Gore who in 2001 despite having one more
HLCL-113|members of the Supreme Court decided that election
HLCL-114|that must have been awful to bear I realized I was inventing a new Pastime Imagining the pain of past electoral losses
HLCL-115|John Adams our second commander-in-chief suffered the indignity of being the first president ever voted out of office losing to Thomas Jefferson and 18
HLCL-116|but he got a measure of Revenge 25 years later when his son John Quincy was elected
HLCL-117|1972 George McGovern lost 49 out of 50
HLCL-118|gates to Richard Nixon bill and I worked hard on McGovern's campaign and have indelible memories defeat
HLCL-119|and let's not forget William Howard Taft from Teddy Roosevelt had grown to succeed
HLCL-120|4 years later in 1912 Teddy decided Taft wasn't doing a good enough job as president so he ran as a third-party candidate split the electorate and Woodrow Wilson one that had to hurt
HLCL-121|then Bill touch my elbow and I snapped back to the present
HLCL-122|the Obamas
HLCL-123|I imagined President Obama riding over in the presidential limo with a man who has risen to prominence partly by lying about barack's birthplace and accusing him of not being an American
HLCL-124|at some point to the day's proceedings Michelle and I shared a rueful look it said
HLCL-125|can you believe this
HLCL-126|eight years before on the bitterly cold in our heads were full of plans and possibilities
HLCL-127|today was just about putting on a game face and getting through it
HLCL-128|the president-elect finally arrived years but never imagined he'd be standing on the steps of the Capitol taking the oath of office as president of the United States
HLCL-129|he was a fixture of the New York scene when I was a Senator like a lot of big-shot real estate guys in the city only more flamboyant and self-promoting
HLCL-130|in 2005 he invited us to his wedding to Melania in Palm Beach Florida
HLCL-131|we weren't friends so I assumed you wanted as much Starpower is he could get
HLCL-132|Bill happened to be speaking in the area that weekend so we decided to go why not I thought it would be a fun Gotti over-the-top spectacle and I was right
HLCL-133|I attended the ceremony then met bill for the reception at Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate we had our photo taken with the bride and groom and left
HLCL-134|the next year Trump joined prominent New Yorkers in a video spoof prepared for the legislative correspondents association dinner in Albany which is the state version of the more famous
HLCL-135|the idea was that the wax figure of me at the Madame Tussauds Museum in Times Square had been stolen so I had to stand in and pretend to be a statue while various famous people walked by and said things to me
HLCL-136|said I was doing a great job as Senator running for president in 2008 as a self under
HLCL-137|when Trump appear he said you look really great unbelievable I've never seen anything like it the hair is Magnificent the face is beautiful you know I really think you'd make a
HLCL-138|president nobody could come close
HLCL-139|the camera pulled back to reveal he wasn't talking to me after all but to his own wax statue
HLCL-140|it was funny at the time when Trump declared his candidacy for real in 2015 I thought it was another joke like a lot of people did
HLCL-141|by then he made himself from tabloid scoundrel into right-wing crank with his defensive quixotic obsession with President Obama's birth certificate
HLCL-142|he flirted with politics for decades but it was hard to take him seriously
HLCL-143|he reminded me of one of those old man ranting on about how the country was going to hell in a handbasket unless people started listening to him
HLCL-144|it was impossible to ignore Trump the media gave him free wall-to-wall coverage
HLCL-145|I thought it was important to call him out for his bigotry which I did early and often starting when
HLCL-146|call Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers
HLCL-147|but it wasn't until I saw him dominated debate with a crowded field of talented Republican candidates powerful arguments but with ugly attacks that Drew gasps
HLCL-148|the I realized he might be for real now carry was with his hand on the Bible promising to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
HLCL-149|the joke it turned out was on us
HLCL-150|it started to rain and people around us fumbled with the thin plastic ponchos we've been given
HLCL-151|backstage I had urge Bill to wear his trench coat the day was unusual a small
HLCL-152|as awkward as the ponchos looked they could have looked worse
HLCL-153|I had heard that the first batch of ponchos that arrived could have looked something like from a certain angle and a sharp-eyed and organizer quickly replace them
HLCL-154|the new president's speech was dark and dystopian I heard it as a howl straight from the white nationalist gut
HLCL-155|it's most memorable quotes about American Carnage a startling phrase more suited to a slasher film that an inaugural address
HLCL-156|Trump painted a picture of a bitter broken country I didn't recognize
HLCL-157|I knew we still had real challenges ones I had talked about endlessly on the campaign Trail income inequality and the increasing concentration of corporate power continuing threats from terrorism and climate change the rising cost of healthcare the need to create more in bed
HLCL-158|jobs in the face of accelerating automation
HLCL-159|the American middle class
HLCL-160|the financial crash of 2008 2009 cost them their jobs and ripped away their security
HLCL-161|it seems like no one was ever held accountable
HLCL-162|Americans across a broad spectrum felt alienated from culturally traditional white voters unsettled by the pace of social change to black men value their lives to dreamers and patriotic Muslim citizens who are made to feel like Intruders in their own land
HLCL-163|Trump was great at rubbing salt and their wounds
HLCL-164|but he was wrong about so much there has been 75 straight months of job growth under President Obama and incomes for the bottom 80% were finally starting to go up
HLCL-165|20 million more people had health insurance thanks the affordable
HLCL-166|the greatest legislative achievement of the outgoing Administration
HLCL-167|crime was still at historic lows our military remain by far the most powerful in the world
HLCL-168|these are knowable verifiable facts
HLCL-169|Trump's world and said the exact opposite
HLCL-170|just as he had throughout the campaign he didn't seem to see or value any of the energy and optimism I saw when I traveled around the country
HLCL-171|listening to trump it almost felt like there was no such thing as truth anymore
HLCL-172|it still feels that way my predecessor in the Senate Daniel Patrick Moynihan entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts
HLCL-173|we can disagree about policies and values but claiming the two plus two equals five and having millions of Americans swallow it
HLCL-174|is very different when the most powerful person in our country says don't believe your eyes don't believe the experts don't believe the numbers just believe me that rips a big hole in a free Democratic Society
HLCL-175|as history Professor Timothy Snyder writes in his book on tyranny 20 lessons from the 20th century
HLCL-176|to abandon facts is to abandon freedom
HLCL-177|if nothing is true then no one can criticize power because there is no basis upon which to do so
HLCL-178|if nothing is true that all is spectacle
HLCL-179|attempting to Define reality is a core feature of authoritarianism
HLCL-180|this is what the Soviets did when they erased political dissidents from historical photos
HLCL-181|this is what happens in George Orwell's classic novel 1984 when a torturer holds up
HLCL-182|four fingers and delivers electric shocks until his prisoner sees five fingers as ordered
HLCL-183|the goal is to make you question logic and reason and too so mistrust toward exactly the people we need to rely on our leaders the Press experts who seek to guide public policy based on evidence and ourselves
HLCL-184|for Trump as with so much he does it's about simple dominance
HLCL-185|the trend didn't start with Trump Al Gore wrote a book called The Assault on reason 2007
HLCL-186|in 2005 Stephen Colbert coin the word truthiness inspired by house Fox News was turning politics into an Evidence fries of seething resentment
HLCL-187|and the Republican politicians whom Fox propelled the power had done their part 2
HLCL-188|Republican strategist Karl Rove famously Justin
HLCL-189|critics who lived in quote the reality-based community unquote
HLCL-190|intended as a slight saying they fail to grasp that quote wear an Empire and when we act we create our own reality and quote
HLCL-191|but Trump has taken the war on truth to a whole new level
HLCL-192|if he stood up tomorrow and declare that the Earth is flat
HLCL-193|his counselor kellyanne Conway just might go on Fox News and defend it as an alternative fact
HLCL-194|and too many people would believe it just look at what happened several weeks into his presidency when Trump falsely accused President Obama of having wiretapped him a claim that was widely and quickly debunked
HLCL-195|a subsequent poll found that 74% of Republicans nevertheless thought it was at least somewhat likely to be true
HLCL-196|Trump's inaugural address was aimed squarely at millions of Americans who felt insecure and frustrated even hopeless in a changing economy and Society
HLCL-197|a lot of people were looking for someone to blame
HLCL-198|too many saw the world and zero some terms believing that gains made by fellow Americans they viewed as other people of color immigrants women lgbtq people Muslims were not learned and must be coming at someone's expense
HLCL-199|economic pain and dislocation were real and so was the psychic pain it made for a toxic combustible mix
HLCL-200|I hadn't been blind to the power of this anger
HLCL-201|during the campaign both went back and reread the True Believer Eric offers 1951 exploration of the psychology behind fanaticism and mass movements and I shared it with my senior
HLCL-202|on the campaign Trail for the ideas that I believe would address many of the underlying causes of discontent and help make life better for all Americans
HLCL-203|but I couldn't and wouldn't
HLCL-204|compete distilled people's rage and resentment I think that's dangerous it helps leaders who want to take advantage of that rage to hurt people rather than help them
HLCL-205|besides it's just not how I'm wired
HLCL-206|maybe that's why Trump was now delivering the inaugural address and I was sitting in the crowd
HLCL-207|what would I have said if it were me up there it would have been daunting Define the words to match the moment
HLCL-208|I probably would have gone through a million drafts my poor speechwriters would have been sprinting only steps ahead of me carrying the thumb drive with the final draft to the teleprompter operator
HLCL-209|but I would have relished the chance to
HLCL-210|beyond the rancor of the campaign reach out to all Americans regardless of who they voted for National reconciliation opportunity and inclusive prosperity
HLCL-211|it would have been an extraordinary honor to be the first woman to take the oath
HLCL-212|I won't pretend I hadn't dreamt of that moment for me for my mother for my daughter her daughter everyone's daughters and for our sons
HLCL-213|instead the world was listening to the new president's undimmed Fury
HLCL-214|I remembered the late Maya Angelou reading one of her poems at Bills first inauguration
HLCL-215|do not be wedded forever to fear yoked eternally to brutishness she urged us
HLCL-216|what would she say if she could hear this speech
HLCL-217|then it was done and he was our president
HLCL-218|that was some weird s*** George W reportedly said with characteristic Texas bluntness
HLCL-219|I couldn't have agreed more headed up the stairs to leave the platform and go back inside the capitol shaking hands along the way
HLCL-220|I saw a man off to decide who I thought was reince priebus head of the Republican National Committee and incoming white house chief of staff
HLCL-221|as I passed by we shook hands and exchanged small talk
HLCL-222|later I realized it hadn't been priebus at all
HLCL-223|it was Jason Chaffetz then Utah congressman and wannabe Javert who made endless political hay out of my emails and the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi Libya
HLCL-224|later Jason's posted a picture of our handshake with the caption
HLCL-225|quote so pleased she is not the president I thanked her for her service and wish her luck the investigation
HLCL-226|continues on quote what a Class Act
HLCL-227|I came this close to tweeting back to be honest thought you were Ryan's
HLCL-228|the rest of the day was a blur of greeting old friends and trying to avoid eye contact with those people who said terrible things about me during the campaign
HLCL-229|I ran into Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg walking slowly but with Steely determination
HLCL-230|if I had one she might have enjoyed a nice retirement now I hoped she'd stay on the bench as long as humanly possible
HLCL-231|lunch in the capital I sat at our assigned table and commiserated with Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives who I think is one of the shrewdest most effective politicians in Washington
HLCL-232|she deserves enormous credit for marshalling the votes for the 2010
HLCL-233|Affordable Care Act under nearly impossible circumstances and for standing up for what's right whether she's in the majority or the minority
HLCL-234|Republicans have demonized her for years because they know she gets things done
HLCL-235|Senator John McCain of Arizona came over and gave me a hug
HLCL-236|he seemed nearly as distraught as I was
HLCL-237|the niece of a top official in the incoming Trump Administration came over to introduce yourself and whisper in my ear that she had voted for me but was keeping it a secret
HLCL-238|Congressman Ryan zinke soon-to-be Trump's interior secretary brought his wife
HLCL-239|this was somewhat surprising considering that in 2014 he had called me the Antichrist
HLCL-240|maybe he'd forgotten because he didn't come equipped with any garlic or wooden Stakes
HLCL-241|Christ but I hadn't forgotten
HLCL-242|you know Congressman I said I'm not actually the Antichrist
HLCL-243|he was taking a bath and mumbled something about not having mented
HLCL-244|one thing I've learned over the years is how easy it is for some people to say horrible things about me when I'm not around
HLCL-245|but how hard it is for them to look me in the eye and say it to my face
HLCL-246|I talked with Tiffany Trump about her plans to attend law school
HLCL-247|I kidded with Republican senator John cornyn about how I performed much better than expected in his state of Texas
HLCL-248|in the president's remarks at lunch when he was away from the glare of his angry supporters
HLCL-249|Trump thanked billing me for coming then finally we could leave
HLCL-250|little did I know that the first controversy of the new administration had already begun over the size
HLCL-251|crowd at the inauguration as is its practice the u.s. National Park Service quickly public photos to
HLCL-252|this time the new president disputed the photographic evidence showing only a modest and demanded that the park service that the crowds were huge
HLCL-253|this phone in the face of what we could all see with our own eyes
HLCL-254|I had the same view trumped-up there on the platform
HLCL-255|compare it to what I had seen at inaugural since 1993
HLCL-256|I understood why he became so defensive
HLCL-257|there really was a difference
HLCL-258|the episode was silly but also an early warning
HLCL-259|we were in A Brave New World
HLCL-260|if the inauguration on Friday was the worst of times
HLCL-261|Saturday turned out to be the best of times
HLCL-262|I decided to stay at home in Chappaqua New York rather than attend the woman's March protesting the new president
HLCL-263|it was another tough call I wanted badly to join the crowds and chant my heart out
HLCL-264|but I believed it was important for new voices to take the stage especially on this day
HLCL-265|there are so many exciting young women leaders ready to play bigger roles in our politics
HLCL-266|the last thing I wanted was to be a distraction from the genuine outpouring of Grassroots energy
HLCL-267|if I showed up nasty politics would unavoidably follow
HLCL-268|so I sat on my couch and watched in Delight as the networks reported huge crowds and dozens of cities across the United States and around the world
HLCL-269|friend sent me excited reports of pack subway cars and streets overflowing with women and
HLCL-270|anabol ages I scrolled through Twitter and sent out gratitude and Good Vibes
HLCL-271|the women's March was the biggest single protest in American history
HLCL-272|hundreds of thousands of people gathered in cities like New York Los Angeles and Chicago
HLCL-273|thousands also turned out in places like Wyoming and Alaska
HLCL-274|in Washington the March dwarf the crowd that had gathered to see Trump's inauguration the day before
HLCL-275|it was completely peaceful maybe that's what happens when you put women in charge
HLCL-276|it was a far cry from what happened when women first marched on Washington the day before Woodrow Wilson's Inauguration in 1913
HLCL-277|thousands of suffragettes troop down Pennsylvania Avenue demanding the right to vote including ours Paul Helen Keller and Nellie Bly
HLCL-278|Mainline the way gawking jeering and eventually turning into an angry mob
HLCL-279|the police did nothing and scores of Marchers were injured
HLCL-280|the violence through the nation's attention to the suffragette cause
HLCL-281|the superintendent of police was fired Congress held hearings and 7 years later the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified granting women the right to vote
HLCL-282|nearly a century later we've made a lot of progress
HLCL-283|but our new president was a painful reminder of how far we still had to go
HLCL-284|that's why millions of women and many support of men were pouring into the streets
HLCL-285|I will confess that that day was bittersweet
HLCL-286|for years all over the world I had seen women driving Grassroots movements assuming power for themselves and their communities forcing warring armies to the peace table
HLCL-287|we riding the Destinies of Nations
HLCL-288|where we now seeing the stirrings of something similar in the streets of our own country
HLCL-289|it was all inspiring as I said on Twitter at the end of the day
HLCL-290|I couldn't help but ask where those feelings of solidarity outrage and passion had been during the election
HLCL-291|since November more than two dozen mostly in their twenties theaters and stores to apologize for not voting for not doing more to help my campaign
HLCL-292|I responded with Force miles and type nods
HLCL-293|on one occasion an older woman dragged her adult Daughter by the arm to come talk to me and ordered her to apologize for not voting
HLCL-294|which she did had bowed in contrition
HLCL-295|I wanted to stare right in her eyes at the say you didn't how could you not vote you abdicated your responsibility as a citizen at the worst possible time and now you want me to make you feel better
HLCL-296|of course I didn't say any of that
HLCL-297|these people were looking for absolution that I just couldn't give
HLCL-298|we all have to live with the consequences of our decisions
HLCL-299|there had been a lot of days since the election when I wasn't in a very forgiving mood toward anyone including myself
HLCL-300|I was and still am worried about our country
HLCL-301|something is wrong how could 62 million people vote for someone they heard on tape repeated sexual assault
HLCL-302|how could you attack women immigrants Muslims mexican-americans prisoners-of-war and people
HLCL-303|disabilities and as a businessman accused of scamming countless small businesses contractors students and seniors
HLCL-304|and still be elected to the most important and Powerful job in the world
HLCL-305|how can we as a nation allow Untold thousands of Americans to be disenfranchised by voter suppression laws
HLCL-306|why did the media decide to present the controversy over my emails as one of the most important political stories since the end of World War II
HLCL-307|how did I let that happen how did we
HLCL-308|for all my concerns watching the women's March I couldn't help but be swept up in the joy of the moment and feel the unmistakable Vitality of American democracy was reasserting itself before our eyes
HLCL-309|my Twitter feed filled up with photos of Marchers holding funny poignant indignant signs
HLCL-310|so bad even introverts are here
HLCL-311|9 and not giving up
HLCL-312|science is not a liberal conspiracy
HLCL-313|one adorable little boy had this message around his neck
HLCL-314|I love naps but I stay woke
HLCL-315|I also saw young girls holding up quotes from my speeches over the years
HLCL-316|women's rights are human rights
HLCL-317|I am powerful and valuable
HLCL-318|on a tough weekend seeing those words lifted my spirits
HLCL-319|the people in the streets were sending a message to me and all of us
HLCL-320|don't give up this country is worth fighting for
HLCL-321|for the first time since the election
HLCL-322|I felt hopeful just keep going no feeling is final
HLCL-323|Rainer Maria rilke and gratitude
HLCL-324|November 9th it was cold and raining in New York City
HLCL-325|crowds on the sidewalks turn to face my car as we drove past
HLCL-326|some people were crying some raise their hands or cysts and solidarity
HLCL-327|there were little kids held Aloft by their parents
HLCL-328|this time seeing that made my heart sink instead of sore
HLCL-329|my team had scrambled to find a hole for my concession speech
HLCL-330|The Soaring Jacob K Javits Convention Center Atrium where we had hoped to hold a victory party wasn't an option
HLCL-331|at 3:30 a.m. after scouting a few locations our Advance staff walked into the lobby of the New Yorker Hotel in Midtown Manhattan not far from where my family and I were staying
HLCL-332|they asked the concierge to call and wake up the manager at home
HLCL-333|at 4:30 a.m. they started to prepare one of the hotel's ballrooms for an event everyone is hoped would never happen
HLCL-334|I learned later that the New Yorker was where Muhammad Ali recuperated after losing a bitterly fought 15-round heavyweight championship fight to rival Joe Frazier in 1971
HLCL-335|I never wanted to lose never thought I would but the thing that matters is how you lose at least said the following day
HLCL-336|I'm not crying my friends should not cry
HLCL-337|if we wrote it in a movie no one would believe it
HLCL-338|that morning Bill and I both wore purple
HLCL-339|it was a nod to bipartisanship Blue plus red equals purple
HLCL-340|the night before I'd hoped to thank the country wearing white the color of the suffragettes while standing on a stage cut into the shape of the United States under a vast glass ceiling
HLCL-341|we had really gone the distance on the symbolism
HLCL-342|instead the white suit stayed in the Garment
HLCL-343|out came the gray and purple one I had intended to wear on my first trip to Washington as president elect
HLCL-344|after I finish speaking I hugged as many people in the ballroom as possible
HLCL-345|there were lots of old friends and devoted campaign staffers many of their faces wet with tears
HLCL-346|I was dry I'd and felt calm and clear
HLCL-347|my job was to get through this morning smile
HLCL-348|be strong for everyone and show America that life went on and our Republic would endure
HLCL-349|a lifespan in the public eye has given me lots of practice at that
HLCL-350|I wear my composure like a suit of armor for better or worse
HLCL-351|in some ways it felt like I had been training for this latest ft of self-control for decades
HLCL-352|still everytime I call another sobbing friend
HLCL-353|oronce stoically blinking back tears which was almost worse
HLCL-354|I had to fight back a wave of sadness that threatened to swallow me whole
HLCL-355|at every step I felt that I had let everyone down
HLCL-356|because I had Bill Chelsea and her husband Mark were by my side as they had been throughout
HLCL-357|so we're Tim Kaine and his wife and Holton
HLCL-358|the word extraordinary kind and strong under these wrenching circumstances
HLCL-359|I chose him for my running mate out of a superb field of candidates because he had executive experience a stellar record as mayor governor and Senator a well-deserved reputation for decency and good judgment and he was fluent in Spanish from his time as a missionary
HLCL-360|he would have been an effective partner and truth-teller as my vice president
HLCL-361|also I like him a lot after delivering hugs and smiling so long and hard that my face eight
HLCL-362|I asked my senior team to go back to our headquarters in Brooklyn and make sure everyone was okay
HLCL-363|one final way to the crowd a final Tim and
HLCL-364|a quick hug and kiss for Chelsea and Mark who
HLCL-365|everything I felt without me having to say a word
HLCL-366|and Dylan I got into the backseat of a secret service band and were driven away
HLCL-367|I could finally let my smile drain away
HLCL-368|we were mostly quiet every few minutes bill would repeat what he had been staying all morning
HLCL-369|I'm so proud of you too that he now added
HLCL-370|that was a great speech history will remember it
HLCL-371|I loved him for saying it but I didn't have much to say in return
HLCL-372|I felt completely and totally depleted
HLCL-373|and I knew things would feel worse before they started feeling better
HLCL-374|it takes about an hour to drive from Manhattan to our home in Chappaqua
HLCL-375|we live at the end of a quiet street full of trees and whatever stress I'm feeling usually vanishes
HLCL-376|whenever I turn up the cul-de-sac I absolutely love our old house and I'm always happy to be home
HLCL-377|it's cozy Colorful full of Art and every surface is covered with photos of the people I love best in the world
HLCL-378|that day the side of our front gate was pure relief to me
HLCL-379|all I wanted to do was get inside change into comfy clothes and maybe not answer the phone ever again
HLCL-380|I'll confess that I don't remember much about the rest of that day
HLCL-381|I put on yoga pants in a fleece almost immediately
HLCL-382|our two sweet dogs followed me from room to room and I took them outside and just breathe the cold rainy air
HLCL-383|every once in awhile I turn on the news but then turn it off almost immediately
HLCL-384|question blaring in my head was how did this happen
HLCL-385|fortunately I had the good sense to realize that diving into a campaign post-mortem right then would be about the worst thing I could do to myself
HLCL-386|losing is hard for everyone but losing a race you thought you would win is devastating
HLCL-387|I remember when Bill lost his re-election as governor of Arkansas in 1980
HLCL-388|he was so distraught at the outcome that I had to go to the hotel where the election night party was held to speak to his supporters on his behalf
HLCL-389|good while afterward he was so depressed that he practically couldn't get off the floor
HLCL-390|that's not me I keep going I also stew and ruminate
HLCL-391|I run to the tape over and over identifying every mistake especially those made by me
HLCL-392|when I feel wronged I get mad and then I think about how to fight back
HLCL-393|that first day I just felt tired and empty
HLCL-394|the Reckoning was still to come at some point we ate dinner
HLCL-395|we facetimed with our grandchildren two-year-old Charlotte and her baby brother Aiden born in June 2016
HLCL-396|I was reassured to see their mom I knew Chelsea was hurting for me which in turn hurt to think about
HLCL-397|but those kids are an instant mood boost for all of us
HLCL-398|we quietly drank them in that day and every day after
HLCL-399|perhaps most importantly after sleeping hardly at all the night before I climbed into our bed midday for a nice long nap
HLCL-400|I also went to bed early that night and slept in the next morning
HLCL-401|I could finally do that I avoided the phone and email that first day
HLCL-402|I suspected correctly that I was receiving a virtual Avalanche of messages
HLCL-403|I couldn't quite handle it couldn't handle everyone's kindness and sorrow their bewilderment and their theories for where and why we had fallen short
HLCL-404|eventually I dive in but for now bill and I kept the rest of the world out
HLCL-405|I was grateful for the one billionth time that I had a husband who was good company
HLCL-406|not Justin happy times but sad ones as well
HLCL-407|I doubt that many people listening to this will ever lose a presidential election although maybe some have
HLCL-408|hi John I hope you're well
HLCL-409|but we all face loss at some point we all face profound disappointment
HLCL-410|here's what helped me during one of the lowest points in my life
HLCL-411|maybe it'll help you to after that first day I started reaching out to people
HLCL-412|I answered a ton of emails return phone calls it hurt
HLCL-413|there's a reason people isolate themselves when they're suffering
HLCL-414|it can be painful to talk about it painful to hear the concern in our friends voices
HLCL-415|Plus in my case we were all suffering
HLCL-416|everyone was so upset for me for themselves for America
HLCL-417|off and I ended up doing the comforting rather than being comforted
HLCL-418|still it was good to connect I knew isolation wasn't healthy and that I'd need my friends now more than ever
HLCL-419|I knew that putting off those conversations would only make them harder to have later on
HLCL-420|and I badly wanted to thank everyone who had helped my campaign and make sure they were holding up okay under these circumstances
HLCL-421|what helped most was when someone said this has made me even more committed to the fight
HLCL-422|I'm stepping up my donations I've already started volunteering
HLCL-423|I'm posting more on Facebook I won't stay quiet
HLCL-424|anymore and best of all I'm thinking about running for office myself
HLCL-425|a young woman named Hannah one of my field organizers in Wisconsin sent me this note a few days after my loss
HLCL-426|the past two days have been very difficult but when I think about how I felt on Tuesday morning
HLCL-427|when I cried for an hour because I thought we were about to elect our first woman president
HLCL-428|I know we cannot give up even though these last days have been a different kind of crying
HLCL-429|your Poise and Grace have inspired me to stay strong
HLCL-430|I do know that even though we have all been knocked down by this we will rise and through the next few years we will be stronger together and keep fighting for what is right
HLCL-431|from one nasty woman to another thank you
HLCL-432|since I spent a lot of time worrying that my loss would permanently discourage the young people who work for my campaign learning that my defeat hadn't defeated them was a huge relief
HLCL-433|it also roused me if they could keep going so could I
HLCL-434|and maybe if I showed that I wasn't giving up other people would take heart and keep fighting to
HLCL-435|it was especially important to me that all the people who worked on my campaign knew how grateful and proud I was of them
HLCL-436|they've sacrificed a lot over the past two years in some cases putting personal lives on hold moving across the country and working long hours for not that much money
HLCL-437|they never stop believing in me each other and the vision of the country we were working so hard to advance
HLCL-438|now many of them didn't know where their next paycheck would come from
HLCL-439|I did two things right away
HLCL-440|I decided to write and sign letters to all 4400 members of my campaign staff
HLCL-441|thankfully Rob Russo who has been managing my correspondence for years agreed to oversee the whole project
HLCL-442|I also made sure we were able to pay everyone through November 22nd and provide health insurance through the end of the year
HLCL-443|on the Friday after the election we threw a party at a Brooklyn hotel near our headquarters for the circumstances it was surprisingly great
HLCL-444|there was a fantastic band some of the same musicians who played Chelsea and Mark's wedding in 2010 and the dance floor was packed
HLCL-445|it felt a little like an Irish wake celebration amid the sadness
HLCL-446|let it never be said that the Hillary for America staff didn't stick together when it counted
HLCL-447|to help matters there was an open bar
HLCL-448|after everyone worked up a sweat I took the microphone to say thank you
HLCL-449|everyone screamed right back at me
HLCL-450|really I couldn't have asked for more good-natured hard-working team
HLCL-451|I told them how important it was that they not let this defeat discourage them from public service or from throwing themselves into future campaigns with as much heart and commitment as they had given to mine
HLCL-452|I reminded them about the losing campaigns including Gene McCarthy Democratic primaries and George McGovern in 1972
HLCL-453|and the beatings Democrats took until everything changed in 92 we had stuck it out I was counting on them to keep going to
HLCL-454|I also said that I had a small gift for them a woman's advocacy group called ultraviolet had sent 1200 red roses too
HLCL-455|house earlier that day and I had them packed up and brought them to the party
HLCL-456|they lay in heaps near the exits please take a few as you head home tonight I told everyone think about the hope they represent and the love and gratitude that's so many people around the country feel for all of you
HLCL-457|it was an echo of an earlier moment my team had spent Wednesday and Thursday packing up our campaign offices in Brooklyn Field by pizzas sent by well-wishers from all over the country
HLCL-458|our neighbors in the building had tape signs on the elevator doors that red thank you for what you did
HLCL-459|as staffers carry their last boxes out of headquarters they were greeted by a crowd of children and their parents
HLCL-460|the kids had covered the sidewalk and chalk messages
HLCL-461|girl power stronger together love trumps hate please don't give up
HLCL-462|when bedraggled members of our team filed out for the last time
HLCL-463|the children handed them flowers one last act of kindness from a burrow that had been good to us again and again
HLCL-464|over the next few weeks I dropped any pretense of good cheer
HLCL-465|I was so upset and worried for the country
HLCL-466|I knew the proper and respectable thing to do was to keep quiet and take it all with Grace but inside I was fuming
HLCL-467|the commentator Peter daou who worked on my 2000 campaign captured my feelings when he tweeted
HLCL-468|if trumpet 1 by 3 million votes lost Electoral College by 80,000 and Russia had hacked RNC
HLCL-469|Republicans would have shut down America
HLCL-470|nonetheless I didn't go public with my feelings I let them out in private
HLCL-471|I heard that Donald Trump settled a fraud suit against his Trump University for 25 million dollars
HLCL-472|when I read the news that he felt his team with Wall Street Bankers after relentlessly accusing me of being
HLCL-473|and when I heard he installed Steve Bannon a leading promoter of the alt-right which many have described as including white nationalist as his chief strategist in the White House itself like a new low in a long line of Lowe's
HLCL-474|the White House is sacred ground Franklin D Roosevelt over the fireplace in the state dining room and sent to his wife living in the newly-built White House
HLCL-475|quote I pray heaven to bestow the best
HLCL-476|blessings on this house and all that shall Hereafter inhabited
HLCL-477|but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof
HLCL-478|unquote I hope Adams would have been okay with a wise woman
HLCL-479|I can't imagine what he would say if he could see the likes of who was walking those Halls
HLCL-480|letters started pouring in from people across the country many so poignant that after reading a few I had to put them away and go for a walk
HLCL-481|a third-year law student from Massachusetts named Robin wrote about how she imagined that she and her female friends and classmates would look back on this time
HLCL-482|a November 8th 2016 we felt a sense of Devastation powerlessness and disappointment that we had never felt before
HLCL-483|so we cried and then we squared our shoulders picked
HLCL-484|weather app and got to work we moved onward and onward keeping in mind that we would never ever allow ourselves to feel again as we did that day
HLCL-485|and do our anger and disappointment fueled us it did not consume us make us cynical or cruel
HLCL-486|it made us strong and eventually eventually one of us will crash through that highest hardest glass ceiling
HLCL-487|and it will be because of our hard work determination and resilience
HLCL-488|but it will also be because of you just you wait
HLCL-489|in a PostScript she added if I may recommend some savs time with friends and family of course but also the first season of Friday Night Lights
HLCL-490|the new season of Gilmore Girls the Hamilton cast album Martha Stewart
HLCL-491|mac and cheese glass of red wine
HLCL-492|good advice a woman named Holly from Maryland wrote with additional sensible guidance
HLCL-493|I hope you will sleep as late as you like and wear your sneakers all day
HLCL-494|get a massage and stand in the sun sleep in your own bed and take long walks with your husband Giggle and play patty-cake with your grandson
HLCL-495|breathe think only about whether you want strawberries or blueberries with your breakfast about which Doctor Seuss book to read to your grandchildren listen to the wind or Chopin
HLCL-496|Holly if you're listening thanks
HLCL-497|my friend Debbie from Texas sent me a poem to cheer me up
HLCL-498|her father told her that a friend of his wrote it after they worked for Adlai Stevenson a 22
HLCL-499|presidential candidate on one of his Landslide defeats to Dwight Eisenhower
HLCL-500|I have to admit it made me chuckle the election is now over the result is now known the will of the people has clearly been shown let's all get together let bitterness past I'll hug your elephant and you kiss my ass
HLCL-501|a woman sent me a box of 1000 handmade origami cranes held together by strings
HLCL-502|she explained that in Japan 1000 folded cranes are a powerful symbol of Hope and that hanging them in your home is considered extremely lucky
HLCL-503|I hung them on my porch I take all the luck and hope I could get
HLCL-504|I tried hard to let go of the burden of putting on a happy face or reassuring everyone that I was totally fine
HLCL-505|I knew I would be fine eventually but for those early weeks and months
HLCL-506|tall and while I didn't spill my guts to everyone cross my path I did honestly answer when asked how I was doing
HLCL-507|it'll be okay I'd say but right now it's really hard
HLCL-508|if I was feeling defiant I'd respond bloody but unbowed a phrase from Invictus Nelson Mandela's favorite poem
HLCL-509|if they wanted to commiserate with the latest reports from Washington sometimes I confess about how mad at all made me
HLCL-510|other times I'd say I'm just not quite up for talking about this
HLCL-511|everyone understood I also let people do things for me this doesn't come easily to me
HLCL-512|but Chelsea pointed out mom people want to do something helpful they want you to let them
HLCL-513|so when a friend said she was sending a box full of her favorite books
HLCL-514|another said he was coming up for the weekend even if it was just to take a walk together
HLCL-515|she was taking me to see a play whether I wanted to go or not
HLCL-516|I didn't protest or argue for the first time in years I didn't have to consult a complicated schedule I could just say yes without a second thought
HLCL-517|I thought a lot about my mother part of me was glad she wasn't around to experience another bitter disappointment
HLCL-518|mine are really losing the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008 have been hard for her although she tried never let me see it
HLCL-519|mostly I just missed her I wanted to sit down with her hold her hand and share all my troubles
HLCL-520|friends advised man the power of Xanax and raved about their amazing therapist doctors told me they'd never prescribed so many antidepressants and their lives but that wasn't for me never has been
HLCL-521|instead I did with my instructor Marianne Leticia especially breathwork
HLCL-522|never done alternate nostril breathing it's worth a try
HLCL-523|sit cross-legged with your left hand on your side breathing deeply from your diaphragm place your right thumb on your right nostril and your ring and little fingers on your left
HLCL-524|shut your eyes and close off your right nostril breathing slowly and deeply through your left
HLCL-525|now closed both sides and hold your breath exhale to the right nostril
HLCL-526|then reverse it inhale through the right closet and exhale through the left
HLCL-527|the way it's been explained to me this practice allows oxygen to activate both the right side of the brain which is a source of your creativity and Imagination and the left side with controls reason and logic
HLCL-528|Breathe In and Out completing the cycle a few times you will feel, and more focused
HLCL-529|it may sound silly but it works for me
HLCL-530|it wasn't all yoga and breathing my share of Chardonnay
HLCL-531|I spent time in nature the day after my concession bill and I were in an arboretum it was the perfect time of year for traipsing
HLCL-532|crisp but not freezing with the smell of fall in the air
HLCL-533|we were lost in thought when we met a young woman out hiking with her three-month-old daughter strapped to her back and her dog underfoot
HLCL-534|she seemed a little embarrassed to stop and breed us but she said she couldn't help herself she needed to give me a hug
HLCL-535|it turned out I needed it to later that day she posted a photo of us on Facebook which quickly went viral
HLCL-536|the HRC in the wild meme was born
HLCL-537|throughout November and December bill and I laced up our shoes and hit the trails again and again slowly working
HLCL-538|true why I lost what I could have done better what in the world was going to happen to America now
HLCL-539|we also spent a fair amount of time talking about what we have for dinner that night or what movie to watch next
HLCL-540|I took on projects in August 2016 we had bought the house next door a classic Ranch we always liked the look of with a backyard that connected to ours
HLCL-541|plenty of room for Chelsea Mark and their kids are brothers and their families and our friends
HLCL-542|plus I was getting a little ahead of myself and thinking about how to accommodate the large team that travels with a president
HLCL-543|do September and October we have been quietly remodeling but with the campaign in high gear there hasn't been much time to think about any of that
HLCL-544|now I had nothing but time on my hands
HLCL-545|I spent hours going over plans with the contractor and my interior decorator and friend Rosemarie how paint swatches Furniture a swing sets
HLCL-546|backyard over the fireplace I hung a vintage suffragette Banner that Mark had given me that declared votes for women
HLCL-547|in the family room we put up a colorful painting of the balloon drop at the Democratic National Convention
HLCL-548|bill and I had both gotten a kick out of those balloons Bill especially a memory of happier times
HLCL-549|by Thanksgiving the work on the house was done that morning I walked around making sure everything was perfect before our friends and family descended for dinner
HLCL-550|at one point I stood on the front porch and saw some people gathered down at the corner of our street around a bunch of colorful homemade thank-you signs stuck in the ground
HLCL-551|kids from the neighborhood had made them for me for Thanksgiving covered in hearts and rainbows and American flags it was one of many kind gestures not just from friends and loved ones but also from complete strangers
HLCL-552|that made that first month more bearable
HLCL-553|everything's giving it's become our tradition since leaving the White House to host a bunch of Chelsea's friends who don't travel home for the holiday or who hail from other countries want to experience an American Thanksgiving and all its Glory
HLCL-554|there are always sitting around Long folding tables decorated with leaves and pine cones and votive candles nothing to hide blocking people's views so conversation moves easily back and forth
HLCL-555|we start our meal with Grace by Bill and then go around the table so everyone can say what he or she is thankful for during the past year
HLCL-556|when it was my turn I said I was grateful for the honor of running for president and for my family and friends who supported me
HLCL-557|back in our old house I organize every Closet in a blitz of focused energy that Centaur dogs scurrying from every room I enter
HLCL-558|I called friends and insisted they take a pair of shoes they want said they liked or a blouse I suspected would fit just right
HLCL-559|I have often been that pushy friend so most of them knew to expect it I also organized jumbled heaps of photos into albums stacks of old magazines and disintegrating newspaper clippings and sorted through probably a million business cards that people at handed me over the years
HLCL-560|with every gleaming drawer and every object placed in its correct appointed spot I feel satisfied that I made my world just a little more orderly
HLCL-561|some of my friends push me to go on vacation and we did get away with Chelsea Mark and the grandkids for a few days to the Mohonk Mountain House a favorite spot of mine upstate New York
HLCL-562|but after 20 months of non-stop travel for the campaign on top of four years of globe-trotting as Secretary of State I just wanted to sit in my quiet house and be still
HLCL-563|I tried to lose myself in books our house is packed with them and we keep adding more like my mother I love mystery novels and can plow through one and a single sitting
HLCL-564|some of my recent favorites are by Louise Penny Jacqueline Winspear
HLCL-565|I finished reading Elena Ferrante and relish the story they tell about friendship among women
HLCL-566|our shelves are weighed down with volumes about history and politics especially overseas of presidents but in those first few months they held no interest for me whatsoever
HLCL-567|I went back to things that have given me joy or solace in the past such as Maya Angelo's poetry
HLCL-568|you may write me down in history with your bitter Twisted lies you may trod me in the very dirt but still like dust alright
HLCL-569|you may shoot me with your words you may cut me with your eyes you may kill me with your hatefulness but still like air I'll rise
HLCL-570|on Raw December days with my heart still aching those words helped
HLCL-571|saying them out loud made me feel strong
HLCL-572|I thought of Maya and her rich powerful voice
HLCL-573|she wouldn't have been bad by this not one in
HLCL-574|I went to Broadway shows there's nothing like a play to make you forget your troubles for a few hours
HLCL-575|in my experience even a mediocre play can transport you and show tunes are the best soundtrack for tough times
HLCL-576|you think you're sad let's hear what Fantine from Les Miserables has to say about that
HLCL-577|by far my favorite New York City performance was way off Broadway Charlotte's dance recital
HLCL-578|it's enchanting to watch a bunch of squirming giggling two-year-old trying to dance in unison
HLCL-579|some are intensely focused that would be my granddaughter
HLCL-580|it was lovely as I watched Charlotte and her friends left and fall down and get up again
HLCL-581|I felt a twinge of something I couldn't quite place
HLCL-582|then I realized what it was released
HLCL-583|I had been ready to completely devote the next four or eight years to serving my country
HLCL-584|but that would have come with a cost I would have missed a lot of dance recitals and Bedtime Stories and trips to the playground
HLCL-585|now I have those back that's more than a silver lining that's the motherload
HLCL-586|back at home I caught up on TV shows Bill had been saving Weaver
HLCL-587|through old episodes of The Good Wife Madam Secretary Blue Bloods and NCIS Los Angeles which Bill and sis is the best of the franchise
HLCL-588|I also finally saw the last season of Downton Abbey that show always reminds me of the night I spent in Buckingham Palace in 2011 during President Obama's State visit in a room just down the hall from the balcony with a queen waves to the crowds it was like stepping into a fairy tale
HLCL-589|on the Saturday after the election I turned on Saturday Night Live and watched Kate McKinnon open the show with her impression of me one more time
HLCL-590|she sat at a grand piano and played Hallelujah
HLCL-591|the hauntingly Beautiful song by Leonard Cohen who had died a few days before
HLCL-592|as she saying it seemed like she was fighting back tears
HLCL-593|listening so was I I did my best
HLCL-594|it wasn't much I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
HLCL-595|I've told the truth I didn't come to school you and even though it all went wrong I'll Stand before the Lord of song with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
HLCL-596|at the end Kate as Hillary turned to the camera and said
HLCL-597|I'm not giving up and neither should you
HLCL-598|I prayed a lot I can almost see the cynics rolling their eyes but pray I did
HLCL-599|as fervently as I can remember ever doing
HLCL-600|novelist Anne lamott once wrote that the three essential prayers she knows our help
HLCL-601|thanks wow guess which one I reached for last fall
HLCL-602|I prayed for help to put the sadness and disappointment of my defeat behind me
HLCL-603|to stay hopeful and open-hearted rather than becoming cynical and bitter and defined a new purpose and start a new chapter so the rest of my life wouldn't be spent like Miss havisham from Charles Dickens his Great Expectations rattling around my house obsessing over what might have been
HLCL-604|I pray that my worst fears about Donald Trump wouldn't be realized and that people's lives and America's future would be made better not worse during his presidency
HLCL-605|I'm still praying on that one and I can use all the backup you can muster
HLCL-606|I also prayed for wisdom I had help from Bill shellady the United Methodist Minister who officiated at Chelsea and Mark's marriage and led the memorial service for my mother
HLCL-607|during the campaign he sent me devotionals everyday
HLCL-608|he sent me a commentary that originally appeared in a blog by Pastor Matt Duo
HLCL-609|I read it many times before the week was out
HLCL-610|this passage in particular really moved me
HLCL-611|it is Friday but Sunday is coming
HLCL-612|this is not the devotional I had hoped to write this is not the devotional you wish to receive this day
HLCL-613|well good Friday maybe the starkest representation of a Friday that we have life is filled with a lot of Fridays
HLCL-614|the disciples and Christ followers in the first century Good Friday represented the day that everything fell apart
HLCL-615|all was lost and even though Jesus told his followers that three days later the temple would be restored they betrayed denied fled and hid
HLCL-616|they did just about everything but feel good about Friday and their circumstances
HLCL-617|you are experiencing a Friday
HLCL-618|but Sunday is coming will be shattered hope will be restored but first we must live through the darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday
HLCL-619|I called reverend bill and we talked for a long time
HLCL-620|I reread one of my favorite books The Return of the Prodigal Son by the Dutch priest Henri nouwen
HLCL-621|it's something I've gone back to repeatedly during difficult times in my life
HLCL-622|you may know the parable about the younger of two sons who sprays and sins but finally comes home
HLCL-623|he's welcomed lovingly by his father but resented by his older brother who has stayed behind and served his father honorably while the younger brother did whatever he wanted
HLCL-624|maybe it's because I'm the oldest in our family and something of a Girl Scout
HLCL-625|but I've always identified with the older brother in the parable how grading it must have been to see his Wayward sibling welcome back as if nothing had happened
HLCL-626|it must have felt as if all his years of hard work and dutiful care meant nothing at all
HLCL-627|but the father says that the older brother have I not taken good care of you have you not been close to me have you not been at my side learning and working those things are their own reward
HLCL-628|it's a story about unconditional love
HLCL-629|the love of a father and also the father
HLCL-630|who is always ready to love us no matter how often we stumble and fall
HLCL-631|it makes me think of my dad a flinty tight-lipped man nevertheless always made sure I knew what I meant to him
HLCL-632|I won't always like what you do he tell me but I will always love you
HLCL-633|as a kid I would come up with elaborate hypotheses to test him what if I robbed a store or murdered somebody would you still love me then
HLCL-634|he'd say absolutely I'd be disappointed and sad but I will always love you
HLCL-635|concerts last November I thought to myself
HLCL-636|well Dad what if I lose an election I should have one and let an unqualified bully become president of the United States would you still love me then
HLCL-637|unconditional love is the greatest gift he gave me and I tried to give it to Chelsea and now to Charlotte and Aiden
HLCL-638|now when sees another lesson in the parable of the prodigal son a lesson about gratitude
HLCL-639|I can choose to be grateful even when my emotions and feelings are still steeped in hurt and resentment he writes
HLCL-640|I can choose to speak about goodness and Beauty even when my inner eyes still looks for someone to accuse or something to call Ugly
HLCL-641|I can choose to listen to the voices that forgive and to look at the faces that smile even while I still
HLCL-642|your words of Revenge and see grimaces of hatred
HLCL-643|it's up to us to make the choice to be grateful
HLCL-644|even when things aren't going well now and calls that the discipline of gratitude
HLCL-645|to me it means not just being grateful for the good things because that's easy
HLCL-646|but also to be grateful for the hard things to
HLCL-647|to be grateful even for our flaws because in the end they make us stronger by giving us a chance to reach beyond our grasp
HLCL-648|my task was to be grateful for the humbling experience of losing the presidential election
HLCL-649|humility can be such a painful virtue
HLCL-650|in the Bible Saint Paul reminds us that we all see through a glass Darkly because of our humbling limitations
HLCL-651|that's why I face the Assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things unseen requires a leaf
HLCL-652|it's because of our limitations and Imperfections that we must Reach Out Beyond ourselves to God and to one another
HLCL-653|as the days went by November turned into December and that horrible no good very bad time came to a close
HLCL-654|I began to ReDiscover my gratitude I felt the good effects of all that walking and sleep
HLCL-655|I was getting, and stronger I found myself thinking of new projects I'd like to take on I started accepting invitations to events that spoke to my heart a Planned Parenthood dinner the women in the world Summit and the vital voices Gala celebrating women leaders and activists from around the world
HLCL-656|and Gatherings with students at Harvard Wellesley in Georgetown
HLCL-657|those rooms were full of purposeful energy I soaked it all up and found myself thinking more about the future than the past
HLCL-658|do what you feel in your heart to be right for he'll be criticized anyway you'll be damned if you do and damned if you don't
HLCL-659|Eleanor Roosevelt competition
HLCL-660|for us there is only the trying the rest is not our business
HLCL-661|t.s. Eliot get caught trying
HLCL-662|I ran for president because I thought I'd be good at the job
HLCL-663|I thought that of all the people who might run I had the most relevant experience meaningful accomplishments and ambitious but achievable proposals as well as the temperament to get things done in Washington
HLCL-664|America was doing better than any other major country but there was still too much in equality and too little economic growth
HLCL-665|our diversity was an advantage spurring creativity and vitality but rapid social and economic change alienated people who thought too much was happening too fast and felt left out
HLCL-666|our position in the world was strong but we had to cope with a combustible mix of terrorism globalization and the advances in technology that fueled them both
HLCL-667|I believe that my experience is in the White House Senate and state department equipped me to take on these challenges
HLCL-668|I was prepared as anyone could I had ideas that would make our country stronger and life better for millions of Americans
HLCL-669|in short I thought I'd be a damn good president
HLCL-670|still I never stopped getting asked
HLCL-671|why do you want to be president why but really why
HLCL-672|the implication that there must be something else going on
HLCL-673|some dark ambition and craving for power
HLCL-674|nobody psychoanalyzed Marco Rubio Ted Cruz or Bernie Sanders about why they ran
HLCL-675|it was just accepted as normal but for me
HLCL-676|it was regarded as inevitable people assumed I'd run no matter what
HLCL-677|if somehow abnormal demanding a profound explanation
HLCL-678|after the election I thought a lot about this maybe it's because I'm a woman and we're not used to women running for president
HLCL-679|maybe it's because my style of leadership didn't fit the times
HLCL-680|maybe it's because I never explain myself as bluntly as this
HLCL-681|so let me start from the beginning and tell you how and why I made the decision to run
HLCL-682|you might lose Bill told me I know I said I might lose
HLCL-683|the problem started with history
HLCL-684|it was exceedingly difficult for either party to hold on to the White House for more than 8 years in a row
HLCL-685|in the modern era it had happened only once when George h.w. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan in 1989
HLCL-686|no non-incumbent Democrat had unsuccessfully to succeed another tutor mer since Vice President Martin van Buren in 1836 succeeding Andrew Jackson
HLCL-687|there was still a lot of pent-up anger and resentment left over from the financial crash of 2008 2009
HLCL-688|and while that had to happen on the Republicans watch Democrats have presided over a recovery that had been too slow
HLCL-689|there was also Clinton 42 consider
HLCL-690|pundits were already complaining that the election would be an exhausting contest between two familiar
HLCL-691|the clintons and the bushes
HLCL-692|then there was a matter of my gender
HLCL-693|no woman had ever won the nomination of a major party in the history of our country let alone the presidency
HLCL-694|it's easy to lose sight of how when you stop to consider what it means and the possible reasons behind it it's profoundly sobering
HLCL-695|it was a chilly day in Autumn 2014 and Bill and I had been having the same conversation for months now
HLCL-696|should I run for president for a second time
HLCL-697|lots of talented people ready to jump on board with my campaign if I ran the press and most of the political class assumed I was already running
HLCL-698|so convinced by the caricature of me as a power-hungry woman that they couldn't imagine me doing anything else
HLCL-699|on the other hand could imagine lots of different paths for myself
HLCL-700|I already knew how it felt to lose until you experience it it's hard to comprehend the ache in your gut when you see things going wrong and can't figure out how to fix them
HLCL-701|the sharp blow when the results finally come in
HLCL-702|the disappointment written on the faces of your friends and supporters
HLCL-703|political campaigns are massive Enterprises with thousands of people working together toward a common goal
HLCL-704|but in the end it's intensely personal even a bit lonely
HLCL-705|it's just your name on the ballot you're embraced or repudiated all by yourself
HLCL-706|the race against Barack Obama in 2008 was close and hard-fought
HLCL-707|by the end he led in the all-important delegate count but our popular vote totals were less than one-tenth of 1% apart
HLCL-708|that makes it all the more painful to accept defeat and muster up the good chair to camp
HLCL-709|vigorously for him the Saving Grace was the respect I had for Barack and my belief that he would be a good president who would do everything he could to advance the values we both shared
HLCL-710|that made it a lot easier did I want to put myself through a gruelling race all over again
HLCL-711|my life after leaving politics had turned out to be pretty great
HLCL-712|I join Bill and Chelsea has a new board member of the Clinton Foundation which Bill had turned into a major Global philanthropy after leaving office
HLCL-713|this allowed me to pursue my own passions and have an impact without all the bureaucracy and Petty squabbles of Washington
HLCL-714|I admired what Bill had dealt and I loved the Chelsea had decided to bring her knowledge of Public Health and her private-sector experience to the foundation to improve its management transparency and performance after a period of rapid growth
HLCL-715|at the 2002 International AIDS conference in Barcelona Bill had a conversation with Nelson Mandela about the urgent need to lower the price of hiv-aids drugs in Africa and across the world
HLCL-716|still figured he was well-positioned to help so he began negotiating agreements with drugmakers and governments to lower medicine prices dramatically and to raise the money to pay for it
HLCL-717|it worked more than 11 and a half million people in more than 70 countries hiv-aids treatment
HLCL-718|right now out of everyone being kept Alive by these drugs in developing countries around the world more than half the adults and 75% of the children are benefiting from the Clinton foundation's work
HLCL-719|after recovering from heart bypass surgery in 2004 Bill joined with the American Heart Association to start the alliance for a healthier generation which has helped more than two
HLCL-720|90 million students in more than 35,000 American schools enjoy healthier food and more physical activity
HLCL-721|the alliance made agreements with major beverage companies to reduce calories and drinks available in schools by 90% And also partnered with Michelle Obama's let's move initiative
HLCL-722|the foundation is also fighting the opioid epidemic in the United States helping more than 150,000 small farmers in Africa increase their incomes and bringing in the Caribbean and Pacific
HLCL-723|in 2005 Bill started the Clinton Global initiative a new model of philanthropy for the 21st century that brought together leaders from business government and the nonprofit sector to make concrete commitments for action on everything from Distributing clean water to improving Energy Efficiency to providing hearing aids to deaf children
HLCL-724|the conference has highlighted the most exciting commitments and their results could just show up and talk you had to actually do something
HLCL-725|after 12 years CGI members and their Affiliates in CGI America and CGI International had made more than 3,600 commitments which have improved the lives of more than 435 million people in more than 180 countries
HLCL-726|among cgi's greatest hits were sending 500 tons of medical supplies and equipment to West Africa for those fighting the Ebola epidemic and helping raise five hundred million dollars to support small businesses Farm schools and Healthcare in Haiti
HLCL-727|in the United States at no expense to taxpayers CGI helped launch an amazing partnership led by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to meet President Obama's goal of 100,000 new STEM Science technology in
HLCL-728|and Mathematics teachers and it's supported the creation of America's largest private infrastructure fund 16 and a half billion dollars invested by public-employee Pension funds led by the American Federation of teachers aft and North America's Building Trades unions which has created 100,000 jobs and provided skills training to a quarter million workers every year
HLCL-729|join the foundation in 2013 with Melinda Gates and the Gates Foundation called No Ceilings the full participation project to advance rights and opportunities for women girls around the world
HLCL-730|I also created a program called too small to fail to encourage reading talking and singing to infants and toddlers to help their brains develop and build vocabulary
HLCL-731|and Chelsea and I started a network of leading
HLCL-732|Wildlife Conservation organizations to protect the endangered African elephants from poachers
HLCL-733|none of these programs had to pull well or sit on a bumper sticker they just had to make a positive measurable difference in the world after years in the political trenches that was both refreshing and rewarding
HLCL-734|I knew from experience that if I ran for president again everything bill and I had ever touched would be subject to scrutiny and attack including the foundation
HLCL-735|that was a concern but I never imagined that this widely respected Global charity would be as savagely smeared and attacked as it was
HLCL-736|for years the foundation and CGI had been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike
HLCL-737|independent philanthropy Watchdogs charitywatch guidestar and charity Navigator gave the Clinton Foundation top marks for reducing overhead and having a measurable
HLCL-738|positive impact charity watch
HLCL-739|charity Navigator gave it for stars and guidestar rated at Platinum
HLCL-740|but none of that stopped brutal partisan attacks from raining down during the campaign
HLCL-741|I've written about the foundation at some length because a recent analysis published in the Columbia journalism review showed that during the campaign there was twice as much written about the Clinton Foundation as there was on any of the Trump scandals and nearly all of it was negative
HLCL-742|that gets to me as Daniel borak off the founder of Charity watch put it
HLCL-743|if Hillary Clinton wasn't running for president the Clinton Foundation would be seen as one of the great humanitarian Charities of Our Generation
HLCL-744|I believe that's exactly what it is and what it will continue to be and I was proud to be a part of it
HLCL-745|beyond my work with the foundation I also spent time in 2013 and 2014 writing a book called hard choices about my experiences as Secretary of State
HLCL-746|the book was long more than 600 pages about foreign policy but I still had more stories left on The Cutting Room floor and a lot more things I wanted to say
HLCL-747|if I didn't run for president there could be more books to write maybe I could teach and spend time with students
HLCL-748|what's more like many former government officials I found that organizations and companies wanted me to come talk to them about my experiences and share my thoughts on the world and they pay me a pretty penny to do it
HLCL-749|I continued giving many speeches without pay but I liked it there was a way for me to earn a very good living without working for anyone company or sitting on any boards
HLCL-750|it was also a chance to meet interesting people
HLCL-751|I spoke to audiences from a wide range of fields travel agents and auto dealers doctors and Tech entrepreneurs Grocers and summer camp counselors
HLCL-752|I also spoke to Bankers usually I told stories from my time as Secretary of State and answered questions about global hotspots
HLCL-753|I must have recounted the behind-the-scenes story of The Raid that brought us some of Bin Laden to Justice at least 100 times
HLCL-754|sometimes I talked about the importance of creating more opportunities for women both around the world and in Corporate America
HLCL-755|I rarely get partisan what I had to say was interesting to my audiences but it wasn't especially newsworthy
HLCL-756|many of the organization's wanted the speeches to be private and I respected that they were paying for a unique experience that I'm talking about you
HLCL-757|later my opponents spawn wild tales about what terrible things I must have said behind closed doors and how is President I would be forever in the pocket of the shadowy bankers would paid my speaking fees
HLCL-758|I should have seen it coming given my record of Independence in the Senate especially my early warnings about the mortgage crisis my votes against the Bush tax cuts in favor of financial regulation including closing the tax loophole for hedge funds known as carried interest this didn't seem to be a credible attack I didn't think many Americans would believe that I sell a lifetime of principle
HLCL-759|you know what you're doing something and you know there's nothing more to it and certainly nothing Sinister it's easy to assume that others will see it the same way
HLCL-760|that was a mistake just because many former government officials have been paid large fees to give speeches I shouldn't have assumed it would be okay for me to do it especially after the financial crisis of Two
HLCL-761|2009 I should have realized it would be bad Optics and stayed away from anything having to do with Wall Street
HLCL-762|this is one of the mistakes I made that you'll hear about in this book I tried to give an honest accounting of when I got it wrong where I fell short and we wish I could go back and do differently
HLCL-763|this isn't easy or fun my mistakes Burn Me Up Inside
HLCL-764|but it's one of my favorite poets Mary Oliver says while our mistakes make us want to cry the world doesn't need more of that
HLCL-765|the truth is everyone's flawed that's the nature of human beings but our mistakes along shouldn't Define us we should be judged by the totality of our work and life
HLCL-766|many problems don't have either or answers and a good decision today may not look as good ten or Twenty Years Later through the lens of new conditions
HLCL-767|when you're in politics this gets more complicated we all want and the political press Demands a storyline which tends to cast people at the other Saints or Sinners you're either revered or reviled and there's no juicier political story than the saint who gets unmasked at the center
HLCL-768|a two-dimensional cartoon is easier to digest than a fully-formed person
HLCL-769|for candidate a leader or anyone really the question is not how you flawed it's what do you do about your flaws do you learn from your mistakes so you can do and be better in the future or do you reject the hard work of self-improvement and instead tear others down so you can assert their as bad or worse than you are
HLCL-770|I've always tried to do the former and by-and-large so has our country with our Long March toward a more perfect union
HLCL-771|but Donald Trump does the ladder instead of admitting mistakes he lashes out.
HLCL-772|others often projecting by accusing others of doing what he himself has done or is about to do
HLCL-773|so if he knows that the Donald J Trump Foundation is little more than a personal piggy bank he'll turn around and accused with no evidence the well-respected Clinton Foundation of being corrupt
HLCL-774|there's a method to this madness for Trump is everyone's down in the mud with him then he's no dirtier than anyone else he doesn't have to do better
HLCL-775|I think that's why he seems to relish humiliating people around him
HLCL-776|and it's why he must have been delighted when Marco Rubio tried to match him and sling prude personal insults during the primaries
HLCL-777|of course it hurt Rubio much more than Trump as Bill likes to say Never Wrestle a pig in the mud they have cloven Hooves which give them Superior Traction and they love getting dirty
HLCL-778|sadly Trump strategy works when people start believing that all politicians are liars and Crooks the truly corrupt escaped scrutiny and cynicism grows
HLCL-779|I'm getting ahead of myself back to 2014 and deciding to run for president
HLCL-780|we talked about my work at the foundation my book in my speeches by far the best part about my life after government and probably the most compelling reason not to run was being a grandmother
HLCL-781|I loved it even more than I expected
HLCL-782|bill and I found ourselves looking for any excuse to drive down to Manhattan so we could drop Chelsea and Mark since he little Charlotte who was born that September
HLCL-783|we became the world's most enthusiastic babysitters book readers and Playmates
HLCL-784|we were doubly blessed when Aidan arrived in June 2016
HLCL-785|running for president again would be putting all this my wonderful new life on hold and climbing back on the high wire of national politics
HLCL-786|I wasn't sure I was ready to do that
HLCL-787|my family was incredibly supportive if I wanted to run they would be there for me 100%
HLCL-788|Chelsea had campaigned relentlessly in 2008 becoming a superb surrogate and sounding board for me
HLCL-789|more than almost anyone alive about what it takes to be president
HLCL-790|he was convinced I was the best person for the job and strenuously denied that this was just a husband's love talking
HLCL-791|still the obstacles were daunting yes I have left the state department with some of the highest approval ratings of anyone public life
HLCL-792|one poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News in January 2013 put me at 69%
HLCL-793|I was also the most admired woman in the world according to the annual Gallup poll
HLCL-794|the good old days
HLCL-795|but I knew that my high approval rating was partly because Republicans had been willing to work with me when I was secretary and praise my service
HLCL-796|they're trained their fire on President Obama and largely left me alone
HLCL-797|also the Press Corps covering me and genuinely cared about the work of diplomacy and the issues I dealt with
HLCL-798|which meant the news coverage of my work with substantiv and for the most part accurate
HLCL-799|I knew it would be different if I ran for president again and as Bill said and history supported the country's perennial desire for change would make it hard for any Democrat to win especially one like me who is closely tied to the current Administration
HLCL-800|in 2014 President Obama's approval rating with Stockton the low 40s
HLCL-801|despite the administration's best efforts the
HLCL-802|recovery was still anemic with wages and incomes stagnating for most Americans
HLCL-803|the administration had botched the rollout of the new HealthCare Marketplace has a centerpiece of the president's signature legislative accomplishment the Affordable Care Act
HLCL-804|a new terrorist group Isis was seizing territory in Iraq and Syria and beheading civilians live on the internet
HLCL-805|there was even a terrifying Ebola epidemic in Africa that many Americans worried would jump to the United States
HLCL-806|thankfully the Obama Administration reacted swiftly to shore up our Public Health defenses and support Ebola response efforts in West Africa
HLCL-807|despite the facts conservative partisans warned breathlessly and with zero evidence that Isis terrorist with sneak across our Southern border and bring Ebola with them
HLCL-808|it was a right-wing conspiracy theory
HLCL-809|trifecta in the run-up to the 2014 midterms and competitive Challengers
HLCL-810|late at night we compare notes about the anger resentment and cynicism we were seeing in the vicious Republican attacks fueling it
HLCL-811|4 years GOP leaders had stoke the Public's fears and disappointments
HLCL-812|they were willing to sabotage the government in order to block President Obama's agenda
HLCL-813|for them dysfunction wasn't a bug it was a feature
HLCL-814|the worst Washington looked the more voters would reject the idea that government could ever be an effective Force for progress
HLCL-815|they could stop most good things from happening and then be rewarded because nothing good was happening
HLCL-816|when something good did happen such as expanding Healthcare they would focus on terror
HLCL-817|rather than making it better with many of their voters getting their news from partisan sources they had found a way to be consistently rewarded for creating the gridlock voters say they hate
HLCL-818|the success of his strategy was becoming evident
HLCL-819|in 2014 in Georgia and North Carolina I campaigned for two smart talented independent-minded candidates who should have had a good chance to win Michelle Nunn and Senator Kay Hagan
HLCL-820|traces were tight up until the end
HLCL-821|but days before the election a Savvy Georgia political Observer confided to me that he'd seen private polling that showed none and other Democrats cratering
HLCL-822|Republicans were using fears about Isis and Ebola to scare people and raised questions about whether a Democrat especially a woman could really be tough
HLCL-823|a national security and several States Republicans ran at mixing images of Ebola responders in hazmat suits with photos of President Obama playing golf
HLCL-824|it's ironic to remember that now with Donald Trump spending about 20% of his new presidency at his golf clubs
HLCL-825|I sometimes wonder if you add together his time spent on golf Twitter and cable news what's left
HLCL-826|Bill told me about a particularly troubling conversation he had with an old friend who lived up in the Ozarks of Northern Arkansas
HLCL-827|he had become an endangered species in Arkansas a still loyal Progressive Democrat
HLCL-828|bill called and asked if he thought two-term Senator Mark Pryor could be re-elected
HLCL-829|Mark was a moderate Democrat with a golden named his father David was an Arkansas Legend
HLCL-830|having served as Congressman governor and senator
HLCL-831|Mark had voted for ObamaCare because he believed everyone deserved the high-quality Health Care he received when he suffered from cancer as a Young Man
HLCL-832|our friend said he didn't know and he and Bill agreed the best way to find out was to visit a certain country store deep in the Ozarks where a couple hundred people regularly came out of the woods to buy food and talk politics
HLCL-833|call Bill and told her what the store owner had said
HLCL-834|you know I always supported Clinton and I like Mark Pryor a lot he's a good man and fared everyone
HLCL-835|but we're going to give Congress to the Republicans
HLCL-836|the store owner was no fool the Republicans wouldn't do anything for him and his neighbors
HLCL-837|but he thought the Democrats hadn't done anything either
HLCL-838|at least the Republicans will do anything to us he said
HLCL-839|Democrats want to take away my gun and make me go to a gay wedding
HLCL-840|sure enough marklost big on Election Day to Tom Cotton one of the most right-wing members of Congress
HLCL-841|it wasn't that voters were turning away from the policies Mark and other Democrats had championed and they passed an increase in the state's minimum wage
HLCL-842|but the politics of cultural identity and resentment were overwhelming evidence reason and personal experience
HLCL-843|it seems like brexit at come to America even before the vote in the United Kingdom
HLCL-844|didn't bode well for 2016
HLCL-845|our party might have won the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections but the political landscape for the 2016 race was shaping up to be extremely challenging
HLCL-846|is it fall this was enough to worry about there was also the simple inescapable fact that I was turning 60 years old
HLCL-847|if I ran in 1B the oldest president since Reagan
HLCL-848|I suspected there'd be ways of rumor-mongering about my health and everything else in my life it would be invasive crass and Insidious
HLCL-849|but contrary to persistent rumors made up and spread by the right-wing media my health was excellent I've recovered fully from the concussion I suffered in late 2012 and had no trouble keeping up a punishing travel schedule
HLCL-850|I admire the likes of Diana nyad who at the age of 64 became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage
HLCL-851|when she finally emerged back on dry land she offered three pieces of advice never ever give up you're never too old to chase your dreams
HLCL-852|and even if something looks like a solitary sport it's a team effort
HLCL-853|words to live by
HLCL-854|still is this how I wanted to spend my time did I really want to put myself back in front of the firing squad National politics for years on end first in the campaign and then hopefully in the White House
HLCL-855|some of my dearest friends including my longtime adviser and former Chiefs of Staff in the White House and the state department Maggie Williams and Cheryl Mills told me I would be crazy to do it
HLCL-856|possession passed up the chance to run everyone from General Colin Powell to Mike Bloomberg to New York Governor Mario Cuomo who came so close to to take him to New Hampshire when he finally decided no
HLCL-857|so why did I do it
HLCL-858|I did it because when you clear away all the petty and not so petty reasons not to run all the headaches
HLCL-859|all the obstacles what was left with something too important to pass up
HLCL-860|it was a chance to do the most good I would ever be able to do
HLCL-861|and just one day at the White House you can get more done for more people then in months anywhere else
HLCL-862|to build an economy that works for everyone and an inclusive society that respected everyone
HLCL-863|we had to take on serious National Security threats
HLCL-864|there were issues already on my mind all the time and they would all require a strong qualified president
HLCL-865|I knew I would make the most of every minute once I started thinking about it that way I couldn't stop
HLCL-866|as it happened the person who gave me the chance to serve as secretary of state would once again play a decisive role
HLCL-867|a month after I left the state department in 2013 Barack and Michelle invited me to join them for a private dinner in the White House residence
HLCL-868|the four of us talked about our kids and experience of raising them in the Fishbowl of the White House
HLCL-869|we discussed wise after the Oval Office Barack and Michelle mused about moving to New York just as we had done
HLCL-870|that Prospect still felt very far away
HLCL-871|we all had high hopes for Barack second term there was a lot of Unfinished Business both at home and around the world
HLCL-872|we had four hours talking late Into the Night
HLCL-873|if back in the key today's of 2008 any of us could have gotten a glimpse of that evening we wouldn't have believed it
HLCL-874|over the next year or so the president and I kept in regular touch
HLCL-875|I think he was just a tiny bit jealous of my newfound Freedom which was a good reminder of how all-consuming the job is
HLCL-876|the following spring some of the time the president and I talked about work especially the foreign policy challenges he was facing in the second term
HLCL-877|but gradually as 2013 turned into 2014 our conversations turn more frequently to politics
HLCL-878|President Obama knew the challenges facing Democrats he never took his re-election for granted and while it was a resounding win 2012 the legitimately and he knew that his legacy depended to a large degree on a democratic victory in 2016
HLCL-879|he made it clear that he believed that I was our party's best chance to hold the White House and keep our progress going and he wanted me to move quickly to prepare to run
HLCL-880|I knew President Obama thought the world of his Vice President Joe Biden and was close to some other potential candidates so is vote of confidence meant a great deal to me
HLCL-881|we had our differences in both style and substance but over
HLCL-882|call Ming Lee we share the same values and policy goals
HLCL-883|we both saw ourselves as pragmatic progressives trying to move the country forward in the face of implacable opposition from a Republican party that have been taken over by the radical conservative tea party Fringe and wasn't thrall to its billionaire backers
HLCL-884|I shared the president's sense of urgency about how much was at stake in 2016 but I still wasn't entirely sold at running was the right decision for me
HLCL-885|insisted that I become Secretary of State and literally wouldn't take no for an answer
HLCL-886|President Obama is a persuasive and persistent advocate
HLCL-887|in the summer of 2013 David plus Obama's former campaign manager who engineered my defeat in 2008 offered to provide any help and advice he could as I planned my next steps after leaving the state department
HLCL-888|I invited him over to my house in Washington and quickly saw by the president had leaned on him so much he really knew his stuff
HLCL-889|we met again in September 2014 when he visited my house once more to give me a presentation about what it would take to build a winning presidential campaign
HLCL-890|he spoke in detail about strategy data personnel and timing
HLCL-891|I listened carefully determined that if I did jump into the race I would avoid the mistakes that a dog me the last time
HLCL-892|plus-size that time was of the essence as hard as that was to believe more than two years before the election
HLCL-893|in fact he said I was late already and urged me to get started
HLCL-894|he was right for me political campaigns have always been something to get through in order to be able to govern which is the real prize I'm not the most natural politician I'm a lot better than I'm usually given credit for but
HLCL-895|true that I've always been more comfortable talking about others rather than myself
HLCL-896|that made me an effective political spouse surrogate and office-holder but I had to adjust when I became a candidate myself
HLCL-897|at the beginning I had to actively try to use the word
HLCL-898|luckily meeting people listening learning building relationships working on policy and trying to help solve problems
HLCL-899|I would have loved to meet all 320 million Americans at a time
HLCL-900|but that's not how campaigns work in the end I came back to the part that's most important to me
HLCL-901|we methodists are taught to do all the good you can
HLCL-902|I knew that if I ran and I could do a world of Good and help an awful lot of people
HLCL-903|does that make me a bishops I guess it does
HLCL-904|but not in the Sinister way that people often mean it
HLCL-905|I did not want to be president because I want Power for power's sake
HLCL-906|I wanted power to do what I could to help solve problems and prepare the country for the future
HLCL-907|it's audacious for anyone to believe he or she should be president but I did
HLCL-908|I started calling policy experts reading thick binders of memos and making lists of problems that needed more thought
HLCL-909|I got excited thinking about all the ways we could make the economy stronger and fairer improve Healthcare and expand coverage make College more affordable and job-training programs more effective and Tackle big challenges such as climate change and terrorism
HLCL-910|it was honestly a lot of fun I talked with John podesta a longtime friends with Ben Bill's Chief of Staff in the white house it was also a top adviser to President Obama
HLCL-911|if I was going to do this again I would need John's help
HLCL-912|he promised that if Iran he'd leave the White House and become chairman of my camp
HLCL-913|he thought we could put together a fantastic team very quickly
HLCL-914|an energetic Grassroots group called ready for Hillary was already drumming up support all of that was very reassuring
HLCL-915|I thought back to what made me run for Senate the first time
HLCL-916|it was the late 1990s and Democrats in New York were urging me to run but I kept turning them down
HLCL-917|no first lady at ever done anything like that before and I hadn't run for office since I'd been Student Government president at Wellesley College
HLCL-918|I visited a school in New York with the tennis star Billie Jean King promoting an HBO special about women in sports
HLCL-919|Ed's was a big banner proclaiming the title of the film dare to compete
HLCL-920|before my speech the seventeen-year-old captain of the high school basketball team introduced me
HLCL-921|her name was Sophia
HLCL-922|as we shook hands she bent down and whispered in my ear
HLCL-923|dare to compete mrs. Clinton dare to compete
HLCL-924|something just clicked for years I have been telling young women to step up participant go for what you believe in how could I not be willing to do the same
HLCL-925|15 years later I was asking myself the same question
HLCL-926|there wasn't one dramatic moment when I declared I'm doing it
HLCL-927|bill and I closed out 2014 with a trip to the beautiful home of our friends Oscar and Annette Dela Renta in the Dominican Republic
HLCL-928|we swam a good food played cards and thought about the future
HLCL-929|by the time we got back I was ready to run
HLCL-930|the most compelling argument is the hardest to say out loud I was convinced that both Bill and Barack were right when they said I would be a better president than any
HLCL-931|out there I also thought I'd win
HLCL-932|I knew that Republicans had moved much further from the Vital Center of American politics and Democrats had as nonpartisan political scientists have documented
HLCL-933|but I still believed that the United States was a pretty sensible country
HLCL-934|previous generations faced much worse crises than anything we've seen from the Civil War to the Great Depression from World War 2 the Cold War and they responded by elected leaders
HLCL-935|only rarely have America's got carried away by extreme sore enthralled by ideology and never for long
HLCL-936|both major political parties despite the madness of their respective nominating process he's nearly always managed to weed out the most extreme candidates
HLCL-937|the four 2016 would never elected a president who flagrantly refused to abide by the basic standards of democracy and DC
HLCL-938|if I was the best qualified candidate had good ideas about the future in the debates and demonstrated a capacity to get things done with both Republicans and Democrats it was reasonable to believe I could get elected and be able to govern effectively
HLCL-939|that's why I ran there are things I regret about the 2016 campaign but the decision to run isn't one of them
HLCL-940|I started this chapter with some lines from TS eliot's poem East Coker that I've always loved
HLCL-941|there is only the fight to recover what has been lost and found and lost again and again and now under conditions that seem unpropitious
HLCL-942|but perhaps either gain or loss for us there is only the trying the rest is not our business
HLCL-943|when I first read that as a teenager in Park Ridge Illinois it's struck a chord somewhere deep inside maybe in that place where dim ancestral memories of indomitable Welsh and English Coal Miner's head alongside half understood stories from my mother's childhood of privation and abandonment
HLCL-944|there is only the trying I went back to that poem a few years later in 1969 when my classmates at Wellesley asked me to speak at our graduation
HLCL-945|many of us were feeling dismayed and disillusioned by the Vietnam War and the racial Injustice in America the assassinations of dr. Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F Kennedy and our seeming inability to change our country's course
HLCL-946|my paraphrasing gave Elliott's elegant English verse a Midwestern makeover
HLCL-947|there's only the trying I told my classmates again and again and a
HLCL-948|what we've lost before
HLCL-949|in the nearly 50 years since it's become a mantra for me and our family that win or lose it's important to get caught trying
HLCL-950|whether you're trying to win an election or pass a piece of legislation that will help millions of people
HLCL-951|build a friendship or save a marriage you're never guaranteed success but you are bound to try again and again and again
HLCL-952|I want to be thoroughly used up when I die for the harder I work the more I live
HLCL-953|life is no brief candle to me it is a sort of Splendid torch which I've got hold of for the moment
HLCL-954|and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to Future Generations
HLCL-955|George Bernard Shaw getting started
HLCL-956|you could say my campaign for president began with a Snappy internet video filmed in April 2015 outside my home in Chappaqua
HLCL-957|or you could point to my formal announcement speech that June on Roosevelt Island in New York
HLCL-958|but I think it started with something a lot more ordinary a Chipotle burrito bowl
HLCL-959|if you're wondering what I'm talking about you probably don't spend much time in the Carnival Fun House of cable and internet news
HLCL-960|it was April 13th 2015 in Maumee Ohio
HLCL-961|Chipotle with a pit stop on my road trip from New York to Iowa home of the first-in-the-nation caucus it was a purposely Loki trip no press no crowds just me a few staff and Secret Service agents
HLCL-962|we bundled into an oversized black
HLCL-963|I called Scooby because it reminds me of the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine Shaggy psychedelic but we love it just the same and set out on our thousand-mile journey
HLCL-964|I had a stack of memos to read a list of calls to make I had also Googled every NPR station from Westchester to Des Moines all set for a long drive
HLCL-965|and Mommy pulled into the parking lot of a strip mall off the highway for lunch
HLCL-966|I ordered a chicken burrito bowl with a side of guacamole
HLCL-967|Nick Merrill my traveling press secretary made fun of me for eating it out of the little cup with a spoon bypassing the chips
HLCL-968|nobody in the restaurant thought it was remarkable that I was there in fact nobody recognized list
HLCL-969|but when members of the press found out they reacted like I had landed in Ohio and extraterrestrial had wandered into a Chipotle
HLCL-970|footage from the restaurant security camera which made it look a little like we were robbing a bank
HLCL-971|the New York Times has the concluded my meal was healthier than the average Chipotle order with fewer calories saturated fat and sodium good they really ate CNN's lunch on that one
HLCL-972|the whole thing felt silly to paraphrase an old saying sometimes a burrito bowl is just a burrito bowl
HLCL-973|soon I was back in Iowa to state that handed me a humbling third-place finish in 2008
HLCL-974|like the road trip I wanted this first visit to be No-Frills I would do more listening than talking just as I had at the start of my first Senate campaign in New York
HLCL-975|my new state director Matt Paul who knew Iowa inside and out after years of working for governor and Senator Tom Harkin agreed
HLCL-976|I went wanted to get to know their candidates not just
HLCL-977|send to them give speeches that's exactly what I wanted to
HLCL-978|When Donald Trump started his campaign he seemed confident that he already had all the answers
HLCL-979|apart from his towering self-regard which blotted out all hope of learning or growing
HLCL-980|as a result he had no need to listen to anyone but himself
HLCL-981|I approach things differently after four years traveling the world as Secretary of State I wanted to reconnect with the problems that we're keeping American families up at night and hear directly about their hopes for the future
HLCL-982|I Decor set of ideas and principles but wanted to hear from voters to inform new plans to match what was really going on in their lives and the country
HLCL-983|one of the first people I met a New Hampshire another early contest state provided a case in point
HLCL-984|was a grandmother in her fifties with gray hair in the air of someone who carries a lot of
HLCL-985|Rihanna shoulders she was an employee of a 111 year-old family-run Furniture business I visited in Keene
HLCL-986|we were talking about how to help small businesses grow but Pam had a different Challenge on her mind
HLCL-987|her daughter had gotten hooked on pain medication after giving birth to a baby boy which led to a long struggle with drug addiction
HLCL-988|eventually Child & Family Services started calling Pam warning that her grandson could end up in foster care
HLCL-989|so she and her husband John took the child in and Pam found herself back in the role of primary caretaker she thought she had finished years before
HLCL-990|Pam wasn't the complaining type this was a labor of love and she was glad to pick up the slack especially now that her daughter was in treatment
HLCL-991|but she was worried a lot of families in town were facing similar struggles in New Hampshire more people were dying from drug overdose
HLCL-992|send from car crashes the number of people seeking treatment for heroin addiction has soared 90% over the past decade for prescription drugs the number was up 500%
HLCL-993|I knew a little about this at the time do and I were friends with three families with lost young adult children to opioids
HLCL-994|sadly that number has now grown to five
HLCL-995|when was it charismatic young man worked at the state department while he was in law school
HLCL-996|a friend of his offered some pills he took them went to sleep that night and never woke up
HLCL-997|others took drugs after drinking and their hearts stopped
HLCL-998|after these tragedies the Clinton Foundation partnered with adapt Pharma to make available free doses of the opioid antidote naloxone Narcan which can save lives by helping prevent overdoses to every High School
HLCL-999|college in the United States first visit to New Hampshire in a coffeeshop in downtown Keene a retired doctor leaned in and asked what can you do about the opioid and heroin epidemic
HLCL-1000|it was chilling to hear that word epidemic but it was the right one
HLCL-1001|in 2015 more than 33,000 people died from overdosing on opioids
HLCL-1002|if you add to that the number from 2014 it's more Americans than were killed in the entire Vietnam War
HLCL-1003|resources for treatment couldn't come close to keeping up
HLCL-1004|parents liquidated their savings to pay for their kids treatment some called the police about their own children because they had tried everything else
HLCL-1005|yet despite all this substance abuse wasn't getting much national attention either in Washington or in the National media
HLCL-1006|I didn't think about it as a campaign issue until I started hearing stories like Pam's in Iowa and New Hampshire
HLCL-1007|I called my policy team together and told them we had to get working right away on a strategy
HLCL-1008|my advisors found out we held Town Hall meetings and heard more stories in one session in New Hampshire a substance abuse counselor asked anyone who'd been impacted by the epidemic to raise his or her hand
HLCL-1009|nearly every hand in the room went up
HLCL-1010|a woman in treatment told me we're not bad people trying to get good we're sick people trying to get well
HLCL-1011|to help her and millions of others do that we came up with a plan to expand access to treatment improve training for doctors and pharmacists prescribing prescription drugs reform the criminal justice system so more nonviolent drug offenders end up in rehab instead of
HLCL-1012|and make sure every first-responder in America carries naloxone which is close to a miracle drug
HLCL-1013|this became a model for how my campaign operated in those early months people told me story after story about the challenges their families faced student debt the high cost of prescription drugs and insurance premiums and wages too low to support a middle-class life
HLCL-1014|I've used those conversations to guide the policies already being hammered out back in our Brooklyn headquarters I wanted my policy shop to be bold Innovative industrious and most importantly responsive to people's real life needs
HLCL-1015|Jake Sullivan my director of policy planning at the state department and Elyria longtime adviser of mine who shared my passion for children and Health Care policy and Maya Harris a veteran civil rights Advocate build and lead a great team
HLCL-1016|you can compare this to how Trump operated when the opioid epidemic finally started getting news attention he jumped on it as a way of making people believe that America was falling apart
HLCL-1017|but once he became president he turned his back on everyone and needed help by seeking to cut money for treatment
HLCL-1018|the Press often seemed by the round tables were these conversations happened critics dismissed them as Stage Door carefully controlled but I wasn't bored I wanted to talk with people
HLCL-1019|to me this was a big part of what running for president was supposed to be
HLCL-1020|over the long months that I'd weighed running a second time I thought a lot about what kind of campaign I'd want I certainly wanted one different from the one I ran during my 2008 primary lost to Barack Obama
HLCL-1021|I studied what he did right and I did wrong there was more to learn after
HLCL-1022|play twelve when the president put together another strong campaign that helped him win re-election over Mitt Romney a healthy margin despite a lackluster economy
HLCL-1023|his operations were two of the best ever I paid attention
HLCL-1024|my low profile first trip to Iowa some of the lessons that I kept in mind as I started to put my own organization in place
HLCL-1025|in 2008 I've been criticized for arriving in Iowa like a queen holding big rallies and acting like victory was inevitable
HLCL-1026|I never thought that was a fair description of me or our campaign we believed I could Prevail in a crowded and talented field but we certainly didn't take Iowa for granted
HLCL-1027|in fact we recognized that it wasn't an ideal first contest for me and spend a fair amount of 2007 trying to figure out how to make the best of it
HLCL-1028|still the criticism stock and I took it seriously this time
HLCL-1029|I was determined to run like an underdog and avoid any whiff of entitlement
HLCL-1030|I also wanted to build on the best parts of my 2008 effort especially the fighting Spirit of our campaigns in Ohio and Pennsylvania where I succeeded in forming a bond with working-class voters who felt invisible in George W Bush's America
HLCL-1031|I have dedicated my victory in the Ohio primary to everyone who's ever been counted out but refuse to be knocked out for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up and for everyone who works hard and never gives up
HLCL-1032|I wanted to bring that Spirit to the 2016 campaign along with the best lessons of Obama's victories
HLCL-1033|we sought to set the right tone with my announcement video it showed a series of Americans talking excitedly about new challenges they were taking on two brothers starting a small business a mom getting her daughter ready for the first day of kindergarten
HLCL-1034|applying for her first job a couple getting married then I appeared briefly to say that I was running for president to help Americans get ahead and stay and then I was going to work hard to earn
HLCL-1035|this campaign wasn't going to be about me and my ambitions it would be about you and yours
HLCL-1036|there were other lessons to put into action in 2008 the Obama campaign had been analytics to model the electorate
HLCL-1037|it focused relentlessly on Grassroots organizing and winning the delegates who actually decide the nomination
HLCL-1038|it also built a no drama campaign organization that largely avoided damaging infighting and leaks
HLCL-1039|John podesta and I talked with President Obama and David about how to construct a team that could replicate these successes
HLCL-1040|what was a big fan of Robby Mook ultimately chose as campaign manager
HLCL-1041|Robbie had impressed David by helping me win against the odds and against him in Nevada Ohio and Indiana in 2008
HLCL-1042|in all three states he put together aggressive field programs and competed hard for every vote then he went on to manage my friend Terry McAuliffe successful Longshot campaign for governor of Virginia
HLCL-1043|Robbie was on a roll highly disciplined and level-headed with a passion for data and a talent for organizing
HLCL-1044|Aberdeen my trusted and valued adviser for years would be campaign vice-chair President Obama praised his pollsters data analytics team Elan kriegel
HLCL-1045|Naveen Nayak came on board to coordinate all these different
HLCL-1046|elements of opinion research to keep it all straight
HLCL-1047|posters call up a random sample of people and ask their opinions about candidates and issues
HLCL-1048|and data analytics teams make a lot of survey called crunch huge amounts of additional demographic consumer and pulling gate and feed it all into complex models to try to predict
HLCL-1049|these are all Staples of modern campaigns
HLCL-1050|to help God messaging and create ads I hired Jim Margolis a respected Obama veteran and Mandy Grunwald would been with me and Bill since our first national campaign in 1992
HLCL-1051|they worked with or ensure my director of paid media and several talented and creative ad agencies
HLCL-1052|I thought Jim's and Mandy's partnership would represent the Best of Both Worlds that's what I was going
HLCL-1053|for with all my hiring decisions makes the best available Talent from the Obama campaign's with top-notch Pros
HLCL-1054|the latter category included Dentistry re-election campaign and 2008 presidential campaign and later helped build up the Clinton Foundation endowment
HLCL-1055|minyon Moore one of the most experienced political operatives in Democratic politics and a veteran of my husband's White House and Jose Via Real a business leader who had worked with me estate and came on board to serve as my campaign treasurer
HLCL-1056|as I built my team I was focused on two tricky areas how to strike the right balance with President Obama and his White House and how to improve my relationship with the Press
HLCL-1057|the challenge of striking a balance with President Obama wasn't personal after all after four years in his cabinet wheel
HLCL-1058|entrusted each other there aren't many people in the world who know what it's like to run for president or live in the White House but we had that in common and it gave us a special bond we finally passed Healthcare something I was overjoyed and gave him a big hug for me
HLCL-1059|after his rough first presidential debate with Mitt Romney in 2012 I tried to cheer him up with a photoshopped image of Big Bird strapped to miss family car Romney had promised to slash funding for PBS and also famously took road trips with his dog on the roof of his car
HLCL-1060|please take a look at the image below smile and then keep that smile near at hand I told the president
HLCL-1061|we'll get this done he replied just hold the world together five more weeks for me
HLCL-1062|now that we can switch places and I was a candidate and he was the cheerleader the challenge for me was navigating the tension between
HLCL-1063|continuity and change on the one hand I believe deeply and what he accomplished as president and desperately wanted to make sure a republican wouldn't be able to undo it all
HLCL-1064|we might have areas of disagreement such as on Syria trade and how to deal with aggressive Russia but by and large I would defend his record try to build on his accomplishments and listen to his advice
HLCL-1065|he would call from time to time and share his thoughts on the race don't try to be hip you're a grandma Haiti's just be yourself and keep doing what you're doing
HLCL-1066|I was proud to have Barack support and nearly everyday told audiences around the country that he didn't get the credit he deserved for putting our country back together after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
HLCL-1067|at the same time there were big problems that still needed fixing in America and part of my job as candidate was to make it clear that I saw them and was ready to take them on
HLCL-1068|inevitably that meant ministrations efforts had fallen short even if the main culprit was Republican obstruction
HLCL-1069|it was a fine line to walk as it would have been for vice president or any Obama administration
HLCL-1070|if I fail to strike the right balance I ran the risk of either seeming disloyal or being cast as the candidate of the status quo both of which would be damaging
HLCL-1071|in one of the first meetings of our new team in a conference room on the 29th floor of a Midtown Manhattan office building Joel benenson presented the results of his early opinion research
HLCL-1072|he said Americans had to maintain points that would likely shape their views of the election economic pressure and political gridlock
HLCL-1073|the economy was definitely in better shape than it had been after the financial crisis but incomes hadn't begun to rise for most families so people still felt like their progress was fragile
HLCL-1074|could be ripped away at any moment and they had come to view dysfunction in Washington as a big part of the problem
HLCL-1075|they were right I had seen that dysfunction firsthand and knew how hard it would be to break through it although I think it's fair to say I underestimated how my opponents would wrongly accuse me of being responsible for a broken system
HLCL-1076|I had a record of success working with Republicans over the years I had plans for aggressive campaign Finance reform which would remove some of the profit motive behind the gridlock and I believe we had a strong shot at making progress
HLCL-1077|the problem remained how to find a compelling way to talk about the pain Americans felt and their dissatisfaction with how things were going in the country without reinforcing Republican criticisms of the Obama Administration which would be self-defeating and just plain wrong
HLCL-1078|Joe said I was starting from a strong Place 55% of
HLCL-1079|in the Battleground States had a favorable view of me
HLCL-1080|voters like that I'd work for Obama after losing to him in 2008 they also thought it showed him
HLCL-1081|but even though I've been in the public eye for decades actually done much less
HLCL-1082|this presented both a challenge and an opportunity despite having their Universal name recognition I would have to reintroduce myself not as an extension of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama but as an independent leader with my own story values and vision
HLCL-1083|there also some warning signs for high just 44% of Voters said they trusted me to be their voice in Washington that told us that some people respected sure I was in it
HLCL-1084|I was determined to change that perception the reason I got into public service was to make life better for children and families and now it was my job to make sure people understood that
HLCL-1085|there was something else we needed to do avoid repeating past problems with the political press Corps
HLCL-1086|over the years my relationship with the political process had become a vicious cycle
HLCL-1087|the more they went after me the more guarded I became which only made them criticize me more
HLCL-1088|I knew that if I wanted 2016 to be different I was going to have to try to change the dynamic and establish a more open and constructive give-and-take
HLCL-1089|there was some precedent as a senator I got along surprisingly well with the rough-and-tumble journalist of New York which consisted largely of journalists who had written about foreign policy for years
HLCL-1090|we talked easily went out together on the road toward Angora
HLCL-1091|in Cambodia in Saudi Arabia dance in South Africa and had adventures all over the globe
HLCL-1092|for the most part they covered me fairly and when I felt they didn't they were open to my criticism now I would establish a similar rapport with the political reporters covering the campaign I knew they were under constant pressure to write stories that would drive clicks and retweets and that negative stories sell so I was skeptical but it was worth a shot
HLCL-1093|to help me do it I hired Jennifer Palmieri a Savvy professional with strong press relationships
HLCL-1094|Jennifer at work for John podesta in the Clinton White House and at the Democratic the center for American progress
HLCL-1095|most recently she had been President Obama's communications director in the White House the president Love Jennifer and so did I
HLCL-1096|I asked Christina Shockey a former top aide to Michelle Obama and later Christina Reynolds had worked in the John Edwards and Obama campaign's to be her deputy
HLCL-1097|they were joined by national press secretary Brian Fallon a graduate of the acclaimed Chuck Schumer School of Communications former spokesman for the Department of Justice and Karen Finney the former MSNBC host who had first work for me in the White House
HLCL-1098|when Jennifer Christine and I sat down together for the first time I let two decades worth of frustrations with the Press pour out
HLCL-1099|I said this is going to be a rough ride but I was ready to try whatever they recommended to get off on a better foot this time
HLCL-1100|with my senior team, together we got to work building an organization that could go the distance
HLCL-1101|presidential campaigns are like startups on steroids very quickly deploy them across the country and build a sophisticated data operation largely from scratch
HLCL-1102|as a candidate you have to manage all that while maintaining a grueling campaign schedule that keeps you hundreds or thousands of miles
HLCL-1103|from headquarters nearly every day in 2008 I had a good hard-working team allowed internal rivalries to fester and didn't establish a clear chain of command until it was too late
HLCL-1104|till we came so close to winning I've all that this time we would do things differently
HLCL-1105|I was determined to have the best data the most field organizers the biggest fundraising Network and the deepest political relationships I was thrilled at Beth Jones a talented manager working at the White House agreed to be campaign Chief Operating Officer
HLCL-1106|delete our organizing and Outreach efforts I turn 23 political Pros Marlin Marshall Craig and Amanda Renteria
HLCL-1107|I also hired experience organizers to run the key early States
HLCL-1108|in addition to Matt Paul in Iowa there was my classic who had helped re-elect my friend Senator Jeanne Shaheen a New Hampshire and led my efforts to beat Trump there and November
HLCL-1109|Tammy Ruiz to victory in the Nevada caucus before moving to Colorado for the general and helping us win their two and play Middleton a long-term victory in the South Carolina primary
HLCL-1110|fuse that campaign with a spirit of innovation we got advice from Eric Schmidt the former CEO of Google and other top Tech leaders and hired Engineers from Silicon Valley Stephanie Hannah and experienced engineer became the first woman to serve as Chief technology officer on a major presidential campaign
HLCL-1111|I hired one of President Obama's former aides Teddy Goff to handle all things digital along with my longtime adviser Katie Dowd and Jenna Lowenstein from EMILY's List
HLCL-1112|the less than TekSavvy candidate but I promise to be a good sport about every Facebook Chat tweetstorm and Snapchat interview they recommended
HLCL-1113|to make sure we built the most diverse team ever assembled by Presidential can
HLCL-1114|Bernard Coleman is the first-ever chief diversity officer made sure women were half the staff and hired hundreds of people of color including for senior leadership roles
HLCL-1115|we put our headquarters in Brooklyn in the office soon teamed with idealistic sleep-deprived 20-somethings it felt like a cross between a text startup and a college dorm
HLCL-1116|I've been a part of a lot of campaigns going all the way back to 1968 and this was the most collegial and collaborative I've ever seen
HLCL-1117|so how did it go we didn't win
HLCL-1118|but I can say with zero equivocation that Mighty made me enormously proud they build a fantastic organization in the early States and help me win the Iowa caucus despite tough demographic as well as the Nevada caucus and the South Carolina primary
HLCL-1119|in the general election they recruited 50,000 more volunteers
HLCL-1120|the 2012 Obama Campaign and contacted voters 5 million more times
HLCL-1121|MyTeam absorbed punch after another and never give up never turned on one another and never stop believing in our cause
HLCL-1122|that doesn't mean there were disagreements and debates over a wide range of questions of course there were it was a landslide defeat in the New Hampshire primary or during the worst days of the email controversy
HLCL-1123|and have I mentioned that we went on to win the national popular vote by nearly 3 million
HLCL-1124|it was a terrific group of people about the senior leadership all the young men and women crowded around desks at headquarters in Brooklyn working impossible hours all the field organizers who were the heart and soul of the campaign all the advanced suitcases for 2 years organized
HLCL-1125|and staging events across the country volunteers of every age and background Americans volunteered then for any campaign in US history
HLCL-1126|my team was so dedicated people who have families and friends to move someplace new knock on doors make phone calls recruit volunteers and persuade voters relationships welcoming newborn
HLCL-1127|Communications AIDS Jesse Ferguson and Tyrone Gale kept working through difficult Cancer Treatments never losing their Devotion to the campaign or their senses of humor
HLCL-1128|some of my favorite moments out on the trail where we volunteer would come up to me as I shook hands on a rope line after a rally they'd whisper in my ear about what a great job our local organizer was doing or how welcoming our staff was two people who wanted to help and how they're into
HLCL-1129|was infectious that always made my day the fact that so many of these young people have decided to stay in politics and keep up the fight despite our loss makes me very happy and proud
HLCL-1130|having said all that of course the campaign didn't go as planned I ended up falling into many of the pitfalls I had worried about and try to avoid from the start
HLCL-1131|some of that was my own doing it was dude forces Beyond My Control
HLCL-1132|despite my intention to run like a scrappy Challenger I became the inevitable FrontRunner before I shook my first hand or gave my first speech just by virtue of sky-high expectations
HLCL-1133|the controversy over my emails quickly cast a shadow over our efforts and threw us into a defensive Crouch from which we never fully recovered
HLCL-1134|you can hear plenty more about that later in this book
HLCL-1135|but suffice to say that we headed mistake
HLCL-1136|turned into a campaign and destroying Scandal toxic mix of partisan opportunism interagency Turf battles a rash FBI director my own inability to explain
HLCL-1137|most people couldn't explain what it was really all about or how the allegations that I was a threat to National Security Square with the support I had from respected military and civilian National Security Experts including Republicans and independents but they understand a big bad
HLCL-1138|one result was that right away I was back in my usual adversarial relationship with the Press clamming up and trying to avoid got two interviews at a time when I needed to be.
HLCL-1139|using myself to the country I watch my approval numbers drop and my disapproval and distrust numbers rise as my message about all the things I wanted to do as president was blocked or overwhelmed
HLCL-1140|there were other disappointments as well in 2008 critics have slammed for not being accessible to voters in avoiding traditional grip-and-grin campaigning
HLCL-1141|this time they went the other way and ridiculed my intimate listening sessions where are the rallies why can't she draw crowd a task that enthusiasm question never really went away even when we drew large crowds
HLCL-1142|other than Nevada where we build extensive organizations I struggled and caucuses just as I had the last time
HLCL-1143|by their structure and rules caucuses favor the most committed activist who are willing to spend long hours waiting to be
HLCL-1144|the daisy advantage to the Insurgent left-wing candidacy of Bernie Sanders
HLCL-1145|secret ballots in all day voting election and much higher turnout
HLCL-1146|the difference was most clear in Washington state which held both a caucus and a primary
HLCL-1147|Bernie won the caucus in March and I won the Primary in May in which three times as many people voted unfortunately most of the delegates were awarded based on the caucus
HLCL-1148|ultimately none of this mattered much after I built up a large delegate lead in March what did Mater and had a lasting impact was it Bernie's presence in the race meant that I have less space and credibility to run the kind of feisty Progressive campaign that help me win Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2008
HLCL-1149|one piece of advice the President Obama gave me throughout the campaign was that we needed more message discipline and he was right in 1992 Bill relied on James Carville and Paul begala to help him shape his wedding message and they made sure that everyone in the campaign in
HLCL-1150|getting the candidate stuck to it.
HLCL-1151|in 2016 my campaign was blessed with many brilliant strategist and they helped me develop a message stronger together that reflected my values and vision and a clear contrast with Trump
HLCL-1152|it may not have been catchy enough to break through the wall of negative coverage about emails maybe nothing could but it was the case I wanted to make and when voters got a chance to hear from me directly at the convention and in the debates polls showed they liked what they heard
HLCL-1153|it's true though that we struggle to stay on message my advisers had to deal with a candidate me and wanted something new to say as opposed to just repeating the same stump speech over and over
HLCL-1154|in addition more than any race I can remember we were constantly buffeted by events from the email controversy to WikiLeaks to mass shootings and terrorist attacks there was no such thing as a normal day
HLCL-1155|and the Press didn't cover normal campaign speeches what they were interested in with a steady diet of conflict and Scandal as a result when it came to driving a consistent message we were fighting an uphill battle
HLCL-1156|all this together and I think you get a picture of a campaign that had both great strengths and weaknesses just like every campaign in history
HLCL-1157|there are important lessons to learn from what we got right and what we got wrong but I totally reject the notion that it was an unusually flawed or dysfunctional campaign that's just wrong
HLCL-1158|my team battled serious headwinds to win the popular vote and if not for the dramatic intervention of the FBI director in the final days I believe that in spite of everything we would have won the White House I've been criticized harshly by political pundits for saying that and even some of my supporters have said they agree with me but I shouldn't say it
HLCL-1159|if you feel this way keep going and give my response a fair hearing
HLCL-1160|since the election I've asked myself many times if I learned the wrong lessons from 2008 was I fighting the previous war when I should have been focused and how much our politics had changed
HLCL-1161|much has been made about my campaign supposed over-reliance on Obama style Big Data at the expense of more traditional political gut instinct and trusting folks on the ground
HLCL-1162|this is another criticism I reject it's true that some of our models were off just like everyone else has including a media the Trump campaign everyone
HLCL-1163|probably because some Trump supporters refuse to talk to pollsters or weren't honest about their preferences or because people change their minds
HLCL-1164|it's also true that like any large organization we could have done a better job listening to the anecdotal feedback we are getting from folks on the
HLCL-1165|it's not like we didn't try
HLCL-1166|my team was constantly in touch with local leaders and I had trusted friends reporting back to me from all over the country including a big group of arkansans the Arkansas Travelers who fanned out and nearly every state
HLCL-1167|I believe they helped us win the razor clothes Missouri primary and they were a constant source of information and perspective for me
HLCL-1168|but every Precinct leader and party chair in the country wants more attention and resources sometimes they're right sometimes they're wrong you can't make those decisions blind you have to be guided by the best data available
HLCL-1169|this isn't an either-or choice you need both data and good old-fashioned political instinct
HLCL-1170|I'm convinced that the answer for Democrats going forward is not to abandon data but to obtain better data use it more effectively question every assumption and keep adapting
HLCL-1171|and we need to listen carefully to what people are telling you and try to assess to
HLCL-1172|still in terms of fighting the previous war I think it's fair to say that I didn't realize how quickly the ground was shifting under all our feet
HLCL-1173|this was the first election for the Supreme Court's disastrous 2010 citizens united decision allowing unlimited political donations was in full force but the Voting Rights Act of 1965 wasn't because of another terrible decision by the court in 2013
HLCL-1174|I was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans anger and resentment
HLCL-1175|I was giving speeches laying out how to solve the country's problems he was ranting on Twitter
HLCL-1176|Democrats were playing by the rules and trying too hard not to offend the Press
HLCL-1177|publicans were checking the rulebook out the window and working the rest as hard as they could
HLCL-1178|Millions more votes but he's the one sitting in the Oval Office
HLCL-1179|both the promise and The Perils of my campaign came together on a brilliantly sunny in 2015 when I formally announce my candidacy in the speech the thousands of supporters on Roosevelt Island in New York's East River
HLCL-1180|now the event seems almost like a quaint throwback to an earlier era of politics a time when policies and polish were assets not liabilities
HLCL-1181|that's hopeful joyous day on Roosevelt Island will always rank as one of my favorites
HLCL-1182|4 weeks before the speech I went back and forth with my team about what to say and how to say it
HLCL-1183|I've never been this coming up my entire life story worldview and agenda B I was also acutely aware that as a first woman to be a credible
HLCL-1184|candidate for president I looked and sounded different than any presidential candidate in our country's history
HLCL-1185|president to follow and voters had no historical frame of reference to draw pain
HLCL-1186|it was exhilarating to enter Uncharted Territory but Uncharted by definition means uncertain
HLCL-1187|if I felt that way I was sure that a lot of Voters would feel even more wary about it
HLCL-1188|I also knew that despite being the first woman to have a serious chance at the White House I was unlikely to be seen as a transformative revolutionary figure
HLCL-1189|I have been on the national stage too long for that and my temperament was too even-keeled instead I hope that my candidacy and if things worked out my presidency would be viewed as the next chapter in The Long Progressive struggle to make the country fair or Freer and stronger and to beat back a seriously scary right-wing agenda
HLCL-1190|this framing took me directly into the politically dangerous territory of seeking a so-called third term after Obama and being seen as a candidate of continuity instead of change but it was honest
HLCL-1191|and I thought placing my candidacy in the grand tradition of my Progressive forebears would help voters accept and embrace the unprecedented nature of my campaign
HLCL-1192|my suggested launching The Campaign on Roosevelt Island named after Franklin Delano Roosevelt
HLCL-1193|personalist will always be Eleanor she was a crusading first lady and Progressive activist who never stopped speaking and didn't give a damn what people thought
HLCL-1194|I returned to her aphorisms again and again
HLCL-1195|if I feel depressed I go to work I'll woman is like a tea bag you never know how strong she is until she's in hot water
HLCL-1196|there was a minor Washington Tempest newspaper claimed to commune directly with
HLCL-1197|I wasn't nice to talk to her now and then
HLCL-1198|I'm also fascinated by Eleanor's husband Franklin and her Uncle Teddy
HLCL-1199|I was riveted by Ken Burns is 7 part documentary about all three Roosevelt's that aired on PBS in 2014
HLCL-1200|I was particularly struck by the parallels between what Teddy phase does president in the early years of the twentieth century as the Industrial Revolution upended American society and what we faced in the early years of the 21st Century
HLCL-1201|in both eras disruptive technological change massive income inequality and excessive corporate power created a social and political crisis
HLCL-1202|Teddy responded by breaking up powerful monopolies passing laws to protect working people and safeguard
HLCL-1203|the environment has been a republican in Progressive
HLCL-1204|he was also a shrewd politician who managed to fend off the demands of angry populace on his left who wanted to go even further toward socialism and conservatives on his right who would have loved the robber barons amassed even more wealth and power
HLCL-1205|Teddy found the right balance and called at the Square Deal had loved that phrase in the more I thought about the challenges facing America in the Years following the financial crisis of 2008-2009 the more I felt that what we needed was another Square Deal
HLCL-1206|we needed to regain our balance take on the forces that it crashed our economy and protect hardworking families short-changed by automation globalization and inequalities
HLCL-1207|we needed the political scale to restrain unchecked greed while defusing the most destructive impulses of resurgent populism
HLCL-1208|on tough days out on the road when reading the news felt like getting your teeth kicked in I'd remember what Teddy said about those of us who climb into the arena
HLCL-1209|it is not the critic who counts he said but the competitor who strives valiantly who airs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcomings but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who at the best nose in the end the Triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly
HLCL-1210|I also was inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal program of the 1930s which saves capitalism from itself following the Great Depression and by his vision of a Humane Progressive internationalist America
HLCL-1211|Four Freedoms Park at the tree line tip of Roosevelt Island commemorates the universal freedoms FDR Proclaim during World War II
HLCL-1212|freedom of speech and worship Freedom from Want and fear
HLCL-1213|it's a picturesque spot with a striking view of the New York skyline announcing my candidacy there felt right
HLCL-1214|the final few days were a flurry of marking of drafts and rewriting lines with Dancewear in my longtime speechwriter had been with me since the Senate
HLCL-1215|as the campaign went on he would be joined by Megan Rooney a wonderful writer who spent four years traveling the world with me at State and then went to the White House to write for President Obama
HLCL-1216|despite our best efforts when the morning of June 13th. And I was still not quite satisfied
HLCL-1217|I turned to the bottom of page for the key moment in the speech when I was supposed to say that's why I'm running for president
HLCL-1218|What followed to make our economy work for you and for every American was true and important it was a result of deliberation and debate with my senior advisers culminating a few days before
HLCL-1219|the table in my dining room in Washington and frustration declared myself finished with the slogans and sound bites and said that I was really running for president and why did we just say that and be done with it
HLCL-1220|but something was missing emotional lift a sense that we were setting out on a common mission to secure our shared Destiny I remember to know the Dan and I had received a few days earlier from Jim Kennedy a great friend who has a death way with words he reflected on a line from Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech
HLCL-1221|our strength is our Unity of purpose
HLCL-1222|America is a family gym noted and we should have one another's backs
HLCL-1223|in that moment I had no idea that the election would turn into a contest between the divisiveness of Donald Trump and my vision of an America that stronger together
HLCL-1224|but it felt right to call 4shared purpose to remind Americans that there is much more that you nice us than divides us
HLCL-1225|I picked up my ballpoint pen and playing off Jim's language road we Americans May differ vicar stumble and fall but we are at our best when we pick each other up when we have each other's back like any family our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common and fight back against those who would drive us apart
HLCL-1226|a few hours later I was standing at the podium in the blinding Sun looking out at the excited faces of cheering supporters I saw little kids perched on their parents shoulders friends smiled up at me from the front row
HLCL-1227|Bill Chelsea and Mark were glowing with pride and love the stage was shaped like our campaign logo a big blue H with a red arrow cutting across the middle
HLCL-1228|all around it AC if the people clapped hollered and waved American flags
HLCL-1229|I allowed myself a moment to think this is really happening I am going to run for president and I am going to win
HLCL-1230|then I started to speak it was hard to read the teleprompter with the sun in my eyes but I knew the words well by this point it was a long speech full of policies and insights developed over the previous months of listening to people such as Pam and New Hampshire everyone's cup of tea but I thought it was the kind of speech a candidate for the most important job in the world ought to give serious substantiv and hopeful
HLCL-1231|I told a couple jokes I may not be the youngest candidate in this race I said but I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States
HLCL-1232|I know that in fact I would end up being the youngest candidate running against septuagenarians Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump
HLCL-1233|I was pleased with how the speech was received the journalist John Allen was followed me over the years declared Clinton pretty much nailed the vision thing
HLCL-1234|Jared Bernstein Joe Biden's former top economic adviser smartly described it as a reconnection agenda I love that that aim to reunite economic growth with the prosperity of middle and low-income families
HLCL-1235|but it was EJ Dionne one of my favorite political commentators who had the most thought-provoking and in retrospect haunting reaction
HLCL-1236|Hillary Clinton is making a bet and issuing a challenge the bet is voters will pay more attention to what she can do for them then to what her opponents will say about her EJ Road
HLCL-1237|the challenges to her Republican adversaries can they go beyond low-tax anti-government to make credible counter-offers to the nurses truckers Factory workers and food servers the heroes of her Roosevelt Island narrative about Grace Under Pressure
HLCL-1238|we know now that I said that not because of Republican came along and made a more credible counter-offer to middle-class voters but because Donald Trump did something else appeal to the ugliest impulses of our national character
HLCL-1239|he also made false promises about being on the side of working people
HLCL-1240|is Michael Bloomberg later said at the Democratic National Convention
HLCL-1241|I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one
HLCL-1242|me too as I would often do in big moments over the course of the campaign I close the speech by talking about my mother Dorothy who passed away in 2011
HLCL-1243|she live to be 92 years old and I often thought about all the progress she witnessed over the course of her long life
HLCL-1244|progress one because generations of Americans kept fighting for what they knew to be right
HLCL-1245|I wish my mother could have been with us longer I said I wish you could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself
HLCL-1246|I wish you could have met Charlotte I wish you could have seen the America we're going to build together
HLCL-1247|I looked out at the crowd and up at the New York skyline across the water smiled and said an America where a father can tell his daughter you can be anything you want to be even president of the United States
HLCL-1248|time is the coin of your life you spend it do not allow others to spend it for you
HLCL-1249|Carl Sandburg a-day-in-the-life
HLCL-1250|a presidential campaign is a Marathon run at the pace of a Sprint everyday every hour every moment counts but there are so many days nearly 600 in the case of the 2015 2016 campaign that you have to be careful not to burn out before hitting the finish line
HLCL-1251|President Obama drill this point home when I was getting ready to run
HLCL-1252|you reminded me that when we faced off in 2008 we would often end up staying at the same hotel in Iowa or New Hampshire
HLCL-1253|he said his team would be finished with dinner and getting ready to call it a night when we finally got there completely spent
HLCL-1254|by the time he woke up the next morning we'd be long gone
HLCL-1255|in short he thought we overdid it Hillary he said you've got to pace yourself this time work smart not just hard whenever we saw each other he'd say it again and he tell John and to remind me
HLCL-1256|I tried to follow his advice after all he won twice
HLCL-1257|my Approach came down to two words routine and joy
HLCL-1258|at the beginning I put some routines and play to keep my traveling team and me as healthy and productive as possible through one of the hardest things any of us would ever do
HLCL-1259|and we all tried to savor every moment that came our way to find joy and meaning in The Daily Grind of campaigning
HLCL-1260|since the election my life and routine of change greatly
HLCL-1261|but I still treasure many moments from that long and sometimes strange trip
HLCL-1262|many mental snapshots that I took along the way are in this chapter
HLCL-1263|so are a lot of details about a typical day on the trail what I ate did my hair and makeup what my mornings were like
HLCL-1264|it may seem strange but I get asked about these things constantly
HLCL-1265|Philippe reines debate prep sessions has my favorite explanation why
HLCL-1266|he calls it the panda principle pandas just live their lives to eat bamboo they play with their kids but for some reason people love watching pandas hoping for something anything to happen
HLCL-1267|and a sneezed the video became a viral sensation
HLCL-1268|under Philippe's Theory I'm like a panda a lot of people just want to see how I live and I do love spending time with my family and getting some sun just like a panda
HLCL-1269|and while I'm not into I like to eat
HLCL-1270|I get it we want to know our leaders and part of that is hearing about Ronald Reagan's Jelly Bean & Madeleine Albright's pin collection
HLCL-1271|in that Spirit if you've ever wondered what a day in the life of a presidential candidate
HLCL-1272|or if you've ever asked yourself does Hillary Clinton just eat lunch like a normal person
HLCL-1273|this is for you 6 a.m. I wake up sometimes hitting the snooze button to steal a few more minutes
HLCL-1274|snoozing leaves you more tired there are studies on this but in that moment it seems like such a great idea
HLCL-1275|as often as we can rearrange my schedule so I can sleep in my own bed in Chappaqua
HLCL-1276|many nights that isn't possible and I wake up in a hotel room somewhere that's okay I can sleep anywhere it's unusual for me to sleep through a bumpy plane landing
HLCL-1277|but waking up at home is the best bill and I bought our home in 1999 because we loved the bedroom
HLCL-1278|it's one-and-a-half stories high with a vaulted ceiling and windows on three sides
HLCL-1279|when we first saw it as prospective homebuyers Bill said
HLCL-1280|we would always wake up happy here with the light streaming and in the view of the garden around us
HLCL-1281|he was right there's a colorful portrait of Chelsea in her late teens on one wall of our bedroom and photos of family and friends scattered everywhere
HLCL-1282|we love the wallpaper with pastel flowers bedroom two
HLCL-1283|there are stacks of books on our bedside tables that we are reading for years we've been keeping careful track of everything we read plus building Bill he has a rating system the best books gets 3 stars
HLCL-1284|after waking up I checked my email and read my morning devotional from Reverend bill shalalie which is usually waiting in my inbox
HLCL-1285|I spend a few minutes and contemplation organizing my thoughts and setting my priorities for the day
HLCL-1286|that it's time for breakfast when I'm home I had downstairs
HLCL-1287|on the road I order room service is hard to plan exactly what or when I'll be eating over the course of the day since we're always on the go so breakfast is key
HLCL-1288|usually I opted for scrambled egg whites with vegetables when they're around and fresh jalapenos otherwise it's salsa and hot sauce
HLCL-1289|I'm a black coffee and strong black tea person and I drink a huge glass of water in the morning and keep drinking water all day long since I fly a lot which can be dehydrating
HLCL-1290|over breakfast I start reading the stack of press clips and briefing papers that have arrived overnight from my staff
HLCL-1291|if I'm home Oscar Flores a Navy veteran who had worked in the White House and is now our residents manager printed all out for me
HLCL-1292|I also take another look at the day schedule which is a logistical masterpiece
HLCL-1293|my team Lana Del Mauro my invaluable scheduler since my Senate days who also
HLCL-1294|work with me at the state department Alex hornibrook director scheduling who previously did the same job for vice president and Jason Chong director of advanced are miracle workers they juggled dates and places with Grace and creates Wallace events out of thin air
HLCL-1295|it isn't unusual to call them from the plane as we are landing at night to say we need to completely redo tomorrow scheduled at one more State and two more events their answer is always no problem
HLCL-1296|if bills in town he's probably still asleep he's a night owl I'm an early bird but sometimes he'll get up with me and we'll read the papers we get for the New York Times the New York daily news the New York Post and The Journal News our local paper
HLCL-1297|and drink our coffee and talk about what we have going on that day
HLCL-1298|it's probably a lot like what's happening at that moment in our neighbors houses except in our case is running for president and the other one
HLCL-1299|to be president I try to find time for yoga or a strength and cardio workout at home I work out an Old Red Barn converted into a gym with space in the converted Hayloft for the Secret Service
HLCL-1300|that's for Ruth Bader Ginsburg however who pumps iron and does planks and push-ups two days a week
HLCL-1301|her regiment is daunting mine is more forgiving
HLCL-1302|but if she can find the time and energy to exercise regularly
HLCL-1303|when I'm on the road I have a mini exercise routine and hotel rooms across America
HLCL-1304|then there's hair and makeup long ago in a galaxy far far away having my hair and makeup done with a special treat every now and again
HLCL-1305|but having to do it every single day takes the fun out of it
HLCL-1306|that makes it easy
HLCL-1307|hairdressers have taken great care of me in New York four years John Barrett puth full-service Salon is in Manhattan and Santa Nichols who's Kozy Salon is just a few minutes from my house in Chappaqua
HLCL-1308|they're both terrific do a lot of people were baffled to discover after my emails were made public that I had regular appointments with Santa
HLCL-1309|I need help with my makeup I see Melissa silver recommended to me by Anna Wintour after she saw me at an event and knew I needed help
HLCL-1310|on the campaign Trail I have a traveling team
HLCL-1311|Isabelle Gaston Barber Lacy Isabella's French and full of positivity she doesn't so much as Bop she's been doing my hair on and off since the mid-1990s which means we've been together through a lot of hairstyles
HLCL-1312|Barbara like Isabel is perpetually cheerful
HLCL-1313|in addition to doing my makeup on the campaign she does makeup from movies and TV shows such as beep
HLCL-1314|of course don't want to be compared to Selina Meyer in any way shape or form but there's no denying Julia Louis-Dreyfus looks fantastic
HLCL-1315|well they get me ready I'm usually on the phone or reading my briefings for the day that our is valuable so I occasionally schedule calls with staff to discuss electoral strategy or new policy
HLCL-1316|they usually don't mind speaking over the blow dryer
HLCL-1317|Isabel and barber do their best to work around me until they tell me they need me to be still see who play
HLCL-1318|at the beginning of the campaign Isabel and Barbara got me ready for the day once a week or so as well as for big events such as debates I tried to take care of my own hair and makeup the rest of the time
HLCL-1319|but photos don't lie and since I look better when they were with me it became an everyday thing
HLCL-1320|when I travel with Isabelle and Barbara are always nearby ready to touch me up before interviews or debates everytime our plane lands Isabel rushes forward with hairspray and Barbara stresses my face with a vaporizer full of mineral water the air on planes is so dry including at times the Secret Service
HLCL-1321|appreciate their talents and like how they make me look but I've never gotten used to how much effort it takes just to be a woman in the public eye
HLCL-1322|I once calculated how many hours I spent having my hair and makeup done during the campaign
HLCL-1323|about 6:00 or 25 days I was so shocked I checked the math twice
HLCL-1324|jealous of my male colleagues often and when it comes to how they can just shower shave put on a suit and be ready to go
HLCL-1325|the few times I've gone out in public without makeup it's made the news so I saw and keep getting back in that chair and dream of a future in which women in the public eye need to wear makeup if they don't want to end no one cares either way
HLCL-1326|after hair and makeup it's time to get dressed when I ran for Senate in 2010 president 2008 I basically had a uniform a simple pantsuit often black with a colorful shell underneath I did this because I like pantsuits they make me feel professional and ready to go plus they helped me avoid the Peril of being photographed up my skirt while sitting on a stage or climbing stairs
HLCL-1327|after that I took a cue from one of my childhood Heroes Nancy Drew do her detective work and sensible trousers I'm glad I wore pads she said in the clue of the tapping heels after hoisting herself up on the Rafters of a bill
HLCL-1328|bring in pursuit of a rare cat I also thought it would be good to do male politicians do and we're more or less the same thing everyday
HLCL-1329|as a woman running for president I liked the visual to that I was different from the men but also familiar
HLCL-1330|a uniform was also an anti distraction technique since there wasn't much to say or report on what I wore maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead
HLCL-1331|in 2016 I wanted to dress the same as I did when I wasn't running for president and not overthinking
HLCL-1332|I was lucky to have something few others do relationships with American designers who help me find outfits I could wear from place to place in all climates
HLCL-1333|Ralph Lauren team made the white suit I wore to accept the nomination and the red white and blue suits I wore to debate Trump three times
HLCL-1334|more than a dozen American designers made t-shirts to support my campaign and
HLCL-1335|and held an event during New York Fashion Week to show them off
HLCL-1336|some people like my clothes and some people don't it goes with the territory you can't please everybody so you may as well wear what works for you that's my theory anyway
HLCL-1337|I try to be super organized but inevitably I over pack I throwing more outfits and I need just in case the weather changes or something spills on me or an eager fan leaves makeup on my shoulder after an exuberant hug
HLCL-1338|someone who knows a thing or two about being stylish while working 20-hour days tries to advise me
HLCL-1339|she's the one who will tell me I have on two different earrings which happened a few times
HLCL-1340|I also overdo it on reading material for a while I filled it in Tire rolling suitcase with briefing memos and policy papers
HLCL-1341|Oscar help me load everything into the cars sometimes bill marveling at all the stuff I'm bringing asks are you
HLCL-1342|away from home when the cars are loaded the husband is hotter than the dogs are cuddled we're off
HLCL-1343|we fly in and out of Westchester County Airport just a short drive from our house
HLCL-1344|I make a policy of trying not to be wheels up before 8:30 a.m. on the nights I sleep at home
HLCL-1345|everyone on my team has at least an hour's drive home after we land in Westchester and we often landlady
HLCL-1346|at 8:30 a.m. start time means everyone gets at least some sleep
HLCL-1347|for the primaries and the beginning of the general election my traveling team with small it consisted of Huma Nick Merrell trip director Conley care Sierra cause Julie zuckerbrod and Barbara Kenny and my secret service detail which was usually two agents sometimes three
HLCL-1348|a rotating cast of additional staff joined depending on what was happening that day
HLCL-1349|speech writers members of the policy team State organizers by the end of the campaign the team was much bigger and so is the plane
HLCL-1350|a note about the Secret Service bill and I have been under Secret Service protection since 1992 as soon as he secured the Democratic nomination for president
HLCL-1351|it took some getting used to but after 25 years it feels normal and to their great credit the agents bend over backward to be as unobtrusive as possible
HLCL-1352|they're somehow both Loki and ferociously vigilant
HLCL-1353|the agents are weapons that are home all day everyday
HLCL-1354|how to do something casual around town like go to the market or take a walk Agents come with me
HLCL-1355|they hang back and give me space to do whatever I'm doing
HLCL-1356|sometimes I forget that they're there which is exactly what they want
HLCL-1357|I'm grateful for the relationships we've built with many of these dedicated men and women over the years we've also gotten to spend time
HLCL-1358|their spouses and children at the Holiday party bill and I host for agents and their families every year and I've met some of their extended families
HLCL-1359|when Bill and I travel weather into Manhattan to see a play or all the way to Nevada for campaign events the Secret Service kicks into higher gear
HLCL-1360|they coordinate ahead of time to make sure they know the details of every place will visit all the entrances and exits the fastest traffic routes and just in case backup routes and the nearest hospital
HLCL-1361|the organizer motorcade run background checks and work with local police at every stop
HLCL-1362|it's an enormous undertaking and they do it seamlessly
HLCL-1363|the only part of this hard time with is the size of the motorcade I understand why it's necessary but it drives me crazy to see people sitting in traffic that I've caused
HLCL-1364|this feels especially problematic when I'm shutting down Highway
HLCL-1365|quickest way to make people resent me which was the exact opposite of what I wanted to do
HLCL-1366|I always ask the lead agent to avoid using lights and Sirens whenever possible
HLCL-1367|I'm also embarrassed to admit that I do a fair amount of backseat driving that's pretty rich coming from someone who hasn't driven a car regularly in 25 years
HLCL-1368|luckily the agents are too polite to tell me to put a sock in it
HLCL-1369|on a typical day on the trail after leaving the house our motorcade of two or three cars pulled up right to the plane on the tarmac
HLCL-1370|door-to-door service is both a security must an extremely nice perk
HLCL-1371|for the primaries in the beginning of the general we flew in planes with 9 or 10 seats the traveling press had a plan of their own which took extra coordination
HLCL-1372|eventually we chartered a Boeing 737 for the general election big enough for all of us with stronger together painted on the side and
HLCL-1373|logos on the tip of each Wing the plane was our home away from home for months for the most part it served us well
HLCL-1374|of course there were occasional hiccups one day we were in Little Rock and had to get to Dallas the plane had a mechanical issue so they sent another one
HLCL-1375|while we were waiting on the tarmac my staff got off the plane to stretch their legs I decided to close my eyes after a grueling few days I woke up a few hours later and asked are we there already in fact we haven't moved at a certain point in a long campaign all sense of time and space disappears
HLCL-1376|over the course of the campaign we were joined by a number of flight attendants they were all excellent but my favorite was Elizabeth Revol see she's a nutritionist and made fresh delicious food for us in her kitchen and queens which Eden packed into containers and brought on the plane salmon salad
HLCL-1377|tenders made with almond flour poblano pepper soup
HLCL-1378|her surprise smash-hit was brownies made out of chickpea flour
HLCL-1379|she also had a big basket full of snacks that she regularly replenishes with different items it was a little Adventure Everytime We boarded and checked out the stash
HLCL-1380|I have a weakness for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers and was delighted to find out that 55 goldfish were only 150 calories not bad
HLCL-1381|one-time Liz brought something I hadn't tried before flavor blasted goldfish we passed around the bag and discussed whether it was better than the original some of my staff thought yes which was incorrect
HLCL-1382|as you can tell we took eating seriously someone once asked us what we talked about on Long flights
HLCL-1383|it's funny how much you look forward to the next meal when you're living out of a suitcase
HLCL-1384|in 2008 we often relied on junk food to see us through I remember a lot of pizza with sliced jalapenos delivered right to the plane
HLCL-1385|this time I was determined that we would all be healthier
HLCL-1386|I asked friends for good on-the-go snack recommendations a few days later shipments of canned salmon as well as question kind protein bars arrived at my house which we logged onto the plane and canvas totes
HLCL-1387|when the crossbars got cold they were too hard to eat so we sat on them for a few minutes to warm them up with as much dignity as one can muster at such a moment
HLCL-1388|I also Splurge every now and again on Burgers and Fries and enjoy every bite
HLCL-1389|several of us put hot sauce on everything I've been a fan since 1992 when I became convinced it boosted my immune system as research now shows that it does
HLCL-1390|we were always on the lookout for new concoctions one favorite is called
HLCL-1391|ninja squirrel Sriracha Julie the videographer came back from vacation in Belize with four little bottles of the best hot sauce ever had Marie Sharp's we immediately love the red habanero pepper flavor the most
HLCL-1392|everyone quietly jockey for that bottle that had it over sheepishly when confronted
HLCL-1393|eventually we realized we could just order more and peace return
HLCL-1394|then there was the food we ate all over the country we had a few favorite spots Middle Eastern takeout place in Detroit at ubin restaurant by the airport in Miami lattes made with honey and lavender from a bakery in Des Moines at the Iowa State Fair in the 100-degree August heat I drank about a gallon of lemonade Nick had me a pork chop on a stick which I devoured when we got back to the point I told him I want you to know that I did not eat that pork chop on a stick because
HLCL-1395|politically necessary I ate that pork chop on a stick because it was delicious
HLCL-1396|he just nodded wordless Lee and kept eating his own State Fair Discovery red velvet funnel cake
HLCL-1397|one hot night in Omaha Nebraska I was consumed with a desire for an ice cream bar the simple kind just vanilla ice cream with a Chocolate shell Connolly called an advance staffer who kindly pick some up from the drugstore and met us at the plane on our way out of town we said Thank you and devoured them before they could melt
HLCL-1398|one of my favorite places to eat and drink is the hotel at Kirkwood Center in Cedar Rapids Iowa it's run by hospitality and culinary students from Kirkwood Community College and they do a great job
HLCL-1399|on one of our first visits I ordered a vodka martini with olives as cold as they could make it
HLCL-1400|Cecile Richards the indomitable leader of planned
HLCL-1401|hood and a Texan was with me and she insisted I try it with Tito's Handmade Vodka the pride of Austin it was a great drink after that whenever we stay at Kirkwood says over an ice-cold Tito's martini with olives without me even having to order it
HLCL-1402|we take birthdays and holidays seriously on the road is put up decorations on board for Halloween and Christmas and there's always a supply of birthday cakes on hand snowfire allowed on the plane so we are girl to pretend that they're lit and make a wish
HLCL-1403|we even found an iPhone app that simulates a lighter to take the game further which we also use to light the menorah we had on board during Hanukkah
HLCL-1404|I am famously hard to surprise on my birthday but for 2016 my team managed to sneak a cake into my hotel suite in Miami and gather sign
HLCL-1405|on the phone in the bedroom when I walked out and Susie Astic rendition of happy birthday and a chocolate cake with turquoise frosting
HLCL-1406|since it was still early in the morning we brought the cake with us on the plane to eat later the night before we had all celebrated together with an Adele concert
HLCL-1407|perfect my team and I lived a lot of life together during our year-and-a-half on the road families changed babies were born beloved friends and family passed away some people got engaged some got separated
HLCL-1408|we raised glass when Loretta Pirelli our director Latino Outreach took the oath to become an American citizen
HLCL-1409|several of us travel to New Haven Connecticut a few weeks after the campaign began to hit the Dance Floor Jake Sullivan's wedding to Maggie goodlander
HLCL-1410|we're often away from home under the gun
HLCL-1411|ourselves as hard as we could to win as a result we relied on one another we came to know one another's habits and preferences we'd often Gather in my room in the evenings to order room service and talked about that day's news coverage or go over the next day schedule
HLCL-1412|we watch the Olympics together and the Republican debates both inspired different kinds
HLCL-1413|we could be impatient with one another frustrated exhausted demoralized but we also made one another laugh hard news gently on the road ahead
HLCL-1414|it was grueling sometimes it wasn't fun at all
HLCL-1415|but it was also wonderful everyday on the trail was packed with events rallies roundtables interviews fundraisers otrs off the records or unannounced visits to Shop Sparks Library schools hospitals really anywhere
HLCL-1416|when we landed in a city we jump from event to event sometimes our drive time would stretch to an hour or more
HLCL-1417|to make the most of it we would schedule radio interviews back-to-back I'd also FaceTime with Charlotte with me
HLCL-1418|I cheer as she spun around in her tutu we sing songs together then I blow kisses hang up and head off to another event
HLCL-1419|Rally's are a whole other world it's thrilling to hear a crowd cheer for you it's thrilling to hear them cheer for your ideas
HLCL-1420|but I'll admit that no matter how many times I've stood before large crowds it's always a little daunting
HLCL-1421|our rallies were diverse boisterous and happy the kind of place you could bring your hundred-year-old mother or your one-year-old son I love seeing all the homemade posters kids would wave while smiling ear-to-ear one of the best things about our campaign with the arrow was it anyone can draw it
HLCL-1422|little kids we wanted children to spread out poster boards on their kitchen tables grab markers and glitter pens and go to town they said a lot of homemade a chart to our Campaign Headquarters we covered the walls with it
HLCL-1423|for the music at our rallies we chose a lot of empowering women artists Sara Bareilles Andra day Jennifer Lopez Katy Perry and Rachel platten as well as songs from Pharrell Williams and John Legend and The Roots we love to see our crowd singing along to the music
HLCL-1424|to this day I can't hear fight song Roar or rise up without getting emotional
HLCL-1425|some people came to our rallies again and again I got to know a few of them a woman named Janelle came with her husband and daughter to a rally in Iowa headlined by Katy Perry the first of many she did for me
HLCL-1426|Janelle had a homemade sign 13th chemo yesterday three more hear me roar
HLCL-1427|she was in the process of fighting breast cancer I was with Bill and we walked over to introduce ourselves we had a nice long talk over the next I saw her many times she'd visit me on the trail update me on her health and her daughter would tell me how second grade was going
HLCL-1428|Janelle kept promising me that she'd see me at my inauguration
HLCL-1429|I kept telling her I'd hold her to it and she better be there
HLCL-1430|for my second debate against Trump in St Louis I invited her to come as my guest
HLCL-1431|my staff would bring groups of people backstage to meet me before I spoke and those brief conversations were often very meaningful
HLCL-1432|I met a lot of women in their 80s and 90s who said how excited they were to finally vote for a Woman for president
HLCL-1433|dressed up in pants suit the temporal for the occasion I imagine myself in 30 years putting on nice clothes and going to hear my candidates speak
HLCL-1434|1 ruling styninger even caucus for me and Iowa when she was 102 years old
HLCL-1435|she made it very clear that she was going to be around to vote for me on Election Day and she was
HLCL-1436|an event at a large arena in New Hampshire I stepped into a side room before going out to speak and met a group of Public School Employees
HLCL-1437|one of them a man named Keith who works in a school library told me his story
HLCL-1438|Keith with his mother's caregiver she had Alzheimer's disease he couldn't afford adult daycare or a home health aide so we had to bring his mom with him to work everyday
HLCL-1439|that stopped me in my tracks he got a little choked up talking to me and I got a little choked up hearing it
HLCL-1440|I thanked him for sharing his story
HLCL-1441|later I told my policy staff who were already working on plans for Alzheimer's research and eldercare to think even bigger
HLCL-1442|on the road lines at Rally's I encountered a feature of modern campaigning that has become far more prevalent since 2008
HLCL-1443|the selfie
HLCL-1444|this is now how we Mark a moment together and to be clear if you see me in the world and want a selfie and I'm not on the phone or racing to get somewhere I'll be glad to take one with you
HLCL-1445|but I think selfies come at a cost let's talk instead
HLCL-1446|do you have something to share I want to hear it
HLCL-1447|provided it's not deeply insulting I have limits
HLCL-1448|I'd love to know your name and where you're from and how things are going with you that's feels real to me
HLCL-1449|a selfie is so impersonal although it does give your wrist a break from autographs now obsolete
HLCL-1450|Roundtable of our special as I mentioned earlier they gave me a chance to hear directly from people in a setting in which they felt comfortable
HLCL-1451|sometimes those conversations were searing
HLCL-1452|I met a 10 year old girl in Las Vegas who took a deep breath and described in a trembling voice how terrified she was of her parents being deported because they were undocumented
HLCL-1453|everyone in that room wanted to give her a hug but I was the lucky one
HLCL-1454|she came over and sat on my lap as I said what I'd say to Chelsea whenever she was anxious as a little girl
HLCL-1455|don't you worry let me do the worrying for you and also you are very brave
HLCL-1456|we tried to make time for otrs seeing local sights and dropping by local businesses whenever we could
HLCL-1457|if we were running late these would be the first to fall off the schedule all the more reason not to announce them so no one would be disappointed if we
HLCL-1458|make it my personal preference for an OTR was anywhere this old kids toys clothes or books I would load up on gear for my grandchildren and a new babies of friends and staffers
HLCL-1459|I also picked up little presents for bill on the road ties shirts cufflinks a watch he loves nothing more than to get something need from a Craftsman somewhere in America it's just about as favorite thing
HLCL-1460|for me fundraisers were a little more complicated than other campaign events even after all these years it's hard for me to ask for other people's money
HLCL-1461|it's hard to ask someone to host an event for you and their home or business
HLCL-1462|but until the day comes that campaign Finance reform is signed into law and upheld by the Supreme Court if you want to run a viable national campaign there's no way around it you're going to have to do some serious fundraising online and in-person
HLCL-1463|it's impossible to do it while maintaining your integrity and Independence Bernie Sanders attack me for raising money from people who worked in finance but I reminded him that President Obama had raised more money from Wall Street than anyone in his new rules to curb risk and prevent future Financial crashes I would have done the same and my donors new it
HLCL-1464|I was grateful to everyone who gave money to our campaign or help raise hit we tried hard to use every penny wisely
HLCL-1465|the campaign staff attest that particular was downright stingy about travel expenses and office supplies
HLCL-1466|Napa absolutely not by your own chips your own hotel room not a chance find a roommate and while you're at it take the bus instead of the train
HLCL-1467|we were all in this together our fundraiser
HLCL-1468|team worked around-the-clock our national campaign staff living and working on a tight budget me flying around the country going to fundraisers and our donors opening their wallets to show their solidarity and support
HLCL-1469|our campaign had more than three million donors the average donation was under $100 and ours was the first campaign in history for which the majority of donors were women that meant a lot to all of us
HLCL-1470|sometimes we just needed to have some fun one beautiful summer evening Jimmy and Jane busted hosted a concert for us at their home in the Hamptons on Long Island
HLCL-1471|I was the first presidential candidate Jimmy ever endorsed anyone wanted to do something special for me
HLCL-1472|so he Jon Bon Jovi and Paul McCartney played a set in a tent full of twinkly lights and everyone danced on the lawn Under the Stars it was magical
HLCL-1473|but my favorite events were with kids they'd sit cross-legged in front of me on the floor or join me in a couch or drape themselves over chairs and I'd answer their questions
HLCL-1474|what's your favorite part about running for president meeting kids like you
HLCL-1475|who's your favorite President with lots of love to Bill and President Obama is Abraham Lincoln
HLCL-1476|what are you going to do to protect the planet reduce our carbon footprint invest in clean energy protect wildlife and fight pollution
HLCL-1477|the children listen with great seriousness and asked follow-ups they were my kind of crowd
HLCL-1478|they also sometimes told me what was worrying them
HLCL-1479|for instance the death of a pet or grandparents illness
HLCL-1480|mennekes asked what I would do about bullying which made me want to become president even more I had an initiative called better than bullying ready to go
HLCL-1481|I have a lot of respect for the Press Corps who traveled with us for the most part it was comprised of embeds journalist permanently embedded with us from the beginning of the campaign until the end
HLCL-1482|they got to know us and we got to know a lot of the journalist and their late twenties and early thirties which made this assignment a big opportunity for them
HLCL-1483|they worked as long and hard as we did some veteran reporters also joined us for stretches Network anchors and big-time columnist would parachute in for interviews and a taste of the road but they never stayed long
HLCL-1484|the traveling press Corps asked tough questions they were hungry I had to admire that with rare exceptions they were also very professional
HLCL-1485|I can't say we were completely comfortable with one another
HLCL-1486|elsewhere in this book I tend to treat jarelis with caution and I often feel like they focus too much on the wrong things I understand
HLCL-1487|political coverage has to be about the horse race but it's become almost entirely about that and not about the issues that matter most to our country and to people's lives
HLCL-1488|that's something that has gotten increasingly worse over the years has changed which makes getting Twix all-important which in turn encourages sensationalism
HLCL-1489|they're responsible for their part
HLCL-1490|having said that I respected them once in a while we go out for drinks or dinner as a group and have a wide-ranging off-the-record talk
HLCL-1491|I'd bring Halloween candy and birthday cake back to their cabin on the plane
HLCL-1492|they'd sometimes roll oranges with questions written in Sharpie at the aisle and try to reach my seat all the way in front
HLCL-1493|sometimes we put on music and open the wine and beer when any of them were sick or dealing with family problems
HLCL-1494|happens during a long campaign to keep me updated
HLCL-1495|some of the journalists also started dating one another and that also happens during an intense nothing makes me happier than playing Matchmaker was always eager for the scoop
HLCL-1496|I also was delighted that many of the journalist assigned to our campaign where women
HLCL-1497|during the 1972 presidential campaign the reporters who traveled with the candidates for called the boys on the bus
HLCL-1498|by 2016 it was the girls on the plane
HLCL-1499|a lot of days and nights on the trail can blur into one another
HLCL-1500|you'd be surprised how many times we had to ask each other where we in Florida or North Carolina yesterday
HLCL-1501|it wasn't out of the ordinary for two people to answer at once but with different states
HLCL-1502|but someday stood out for better or worse
HLCL-1503|what are the best days ever was November 2nd
HLCL-1504|2016 game 7 of the World Series the night the Chicago Cubs made history
HLCL-1505|we were in Arizona for one of our final rallies it was a big one more than 25,000 people came out
HLCL-1506|before I went on stage I asked for an update on the game it was a top of the sixth inning the Cubs led the Cleveland Indians 523 gulp
HLCL-1507|like everyone comes Nation I have been following the playoffs in the series with all my fingers crossed I started watching Cubs games with my dad when I was a little girl sitting on his lap around the floor near his chair in the den we cheer and grown at the end of the season we'd say next year will win the series
HLCL-1508|to assuage my disappointment also became a Yankees fan because they were in the other league
HLCL-1509|some people on my staff with fans to know who liked me
HLCL-1510|outside Chicago she carried a huge W flag with her on the road and every time the Cubs won putting them one step closer to their first world championship in 108 years she draped it on the bulkhead of the plane or warrant like a cape
HLCL-1511|whenever we could we watch the games together holding our breath
HLCL-1512|that night in Arizona when the rally was over the first thing I asked was who won no one yet the score was 66 and the 9th inning
HLCL-1513|15 minute drive back to the hotel but that meant maybe missing the end of the game we couldn't risk it
HLCL-1514|instead Phillipe was traveling with us for the final stretch pulled it up on his iPad and we all sit around him to watch standing on a section of grass in the parking lot
HLCL-1515|capricia Marshall one of my close friends in the former Chief of protocol at the state department was there too
HLCL-1516|she's from Cleveland Indians fan so she did some trash talking
HLCL-1517|anxiety inducing the game went into Extra Innings we stayed put in the parking lot
HLCL-1518|when Chicago recorded the final out in the bottom of the 10th to Edge the Indians 827 Connelly was a happiest I've ever seen her I reach for that W flag and we stretched it out between us and took a million photos then we drove back to the hotel ordered a bunch of food to my hotel suite and watch the highlight-reel especially reliever Mike Montgomery's game-winning Save which he pulled off with a giant smile on his face like he had all the confidence in the world that he was about to make our dreams come true
HLCL-1519|a much less fun day was September 11th 2016 the day I was sick at the national September 11th Memorial Museum
HLCL-1520|it means a lot to me to commemorate that solemn day so missing this event wasn't an option but I felt awful
HLCL-1521|I've been fighting a call from what I thought was allergies for at least a month and saw my internist Doctor Lisa bartek on September 9th
HLCL-1522|she told me the cough was actually pneumonia and I should take a few days off
HLCL-1523|I said I couldn't she gave me strong antibiotics and I went on with my schedule including filming Between Two Ferns with comic Zach Galifianakis that afternoon
HLCL-1524|the next day I stuck to a schedule debate prep session on Sunday when I got to the memorial the sun was beaming down my headache you know the rest
HLCL-1525|when I arrived one of the first people I saw was Senator Chuck Schumer my friend and former colleague Hillary he said how are you I just had pneumonia
HLCL-1526|at this point the fact that I had pneumonia wasn't public so this was totally out of the blue
HLCL-1527|the difference between us was it Chuck didn't have to go out in public as a candidate when he was under the weather as orders and stayed home for a week
HLCL-1528|looking back I should have done the same instead I ended up having to parade in front of the cameras after leaving my daughter's apartment where I had gone to rest to reassure the world that I was fine
HLCL-1529|luckily most of my memories of being in New York during the campaign or a lot better
HLCL-1530|I raced all over the city for the New York primary hitting all five boroughs I play dominoes in Harlem drink boba tea and queens spoken historic Snug Harbor on Staten Island a cheesecake at Junior's in Brooklyn rode the subway in the Bronx struggling with the metro card reader like a typical commuter and had ice cream at a shop called Mikey likes it on the lower
HLCL-1531|side as I tucked into my ice cream in English reporter who is part of the traveling press Corps that day shouted how many calories are in that
HLCL-1532|all of us including the rest of the press Boudin response me louder than anyone
HLCL-1533|in the end we won the New York primary by 16 points
HLCL-1534|Saturday Night Live in tape that episode of funny or dies Between Two Ferns which was surely one of the more surreal experiences of my life it's an odd thing to be a politician on a comedy show your job isn't to be funny you're not especially compared with the actual comedians so don't even try
HLCL-1535|your job is to beat a straight guy that's pretty easy especially for me whose life is basically taking whatever is thrown my way
HLCL-1536|the most important thing is to be game luckily I'm game for a lot
HLCL-1537|SNL asked me to play a character named Val the bartender who would pour drinks for Kate McKinnon
HLCL-1538|who played me would you sing Lean on Me together they asked I said yes even though I have a terrible singing voice for a couple weeks after people would shout at me on the trail
HLCL-1539|I'm between two ferns with Zach Galifianakis ask me I'm going to sneak up on you and I said sure why not you only live once
HLCL-1540|I marched in the 2016 New York City Pride Parade back in the day in 2000 I was the first first lady in history to march in the pride parade this time we had a big contingent from Hillary for America marching together behind a love trumps hate Banner
HLCL-1541|the New York city crowds cheered for us with custo
HLCL-1542|most importantly bill and I welcomed the arrival of our grandson Aiden on June 18th 2016 at Lenox Hill Hospital on the upper east side of Manhattan it was a sunny day with hardly a cloud in the sky
HLCL-1543|a prediction perhaps of his personality he is the happiest little boy it's hard to ask more of a city than that
HLCL-1544|there's one more group of days I want to describe because they're on like any other
HLCL-1545|debate prep it's the debate prep team's job to put me through my Paces so I'm not hearing anything for the first time during the actual debate
HLCL-1546|my team led by Ron playing Karen Dunn and Jake help me prepare for all 12 debates
HLCL-1547|the lawyer and Veteran political strategist who served in the Clinton and Obama White House
HLCL-1548|Karen also a lawyer works for me in the Senate and later for President Obama
HLCL-1549|who knew every word of every one of our policies with a champion debater in college and grad school
HLCL-1550|all three at help prepare President Obama for his debates as well
HLCL-1551|they worked with two indefatigable campaign staffers Sarasota
HLCL-1552|and Christine Acosta to produce briefing binders for me covering hundreds of topics
HLCL-1553|as a lifelong fan of school supplies I fussed over the tabs and dividers and armed myself with a bouquet of highlighters and every color
HLCL-1554|I spent evenings studying and hotel rooms Across America and at my kitchen table by the end I knew my opponent's positions inside and out in some cases better than they did
HLCL-1555|we held most of our debate prep sessions at the Doral Arrowwood a hotel near my home in Westchester County
HLCL-1556|we were joined by more people from my team campaign Consultants Joel benenson Mandy Grunwald and Jim Margolis Tony karke our head of research and Obama debate prep veteran and Bob Barnett who had helped prepare Democratic candidates for debate since Walter Mondale
HLCL-1557|we would gather at noon we practice
HLCL-1558|Pacific exchanges fine-tuned answers and try to plan out dramatic moments that would help shape the coverage of the debate although often the most important classes are the hardest to predict
HLCL-1559|the hotel would Supply us with a smorgasbord that they'd replenished throughout the day sandwiches salads fruit bagels and chicken soup
HLCL-1560|they also have a freezer full of Oreo ice cream bars that we kept emptying and they kept refilling
HLCL-1561|anytime you looked around the room you'd see someone holding one or the stick and rapper on the table in front of them
HLCL-1562|debate prep helped me get ready emotionally for some of the most consequential moment to the camp
HLCL-1563|a presidential debate is theater it's a boxing match its high-stakes surgery pick your metaphor
HLCL-1564|remove all of the eye or slip-of-the-tongue can spell defeat
HLCL-1565|in debate prep I practice keeping my cool while my staff fired hard questions at me
HLCL-1566|take misrepresent my record they'd impugn my character sometimes I'd snap back and feel better for getting it off my chest
HLCL-1567|I think to myself now that I've done that here I don't have to do it on live TV
HLCL-1568|it worked I remember becoming frustrated with my team's advice at one point I couldn't quite understand how they were recommending I handle a potentially contentious exchange with Bernie
HLCL-1569|finally I said to Jake who had been peppering me with questions and grimacing at my answers just show me you do it so he became me and I took on the role of attack against myself it was a truly surreal experience finally he mocked pleaded for Mercy you're right you're right do it your way
HLCL-1570|then there was Philippe as Trump was a sight to see the first time I walk into the room for a prep session
HLCL-1571|he was already at the podium staring at the distant wall and refusing to make eye contact with me
HLCL-1572|Philippe took his character study very seriously including the physicality Trump looms and lurks on a debate stage so Philippe did to always hanging out on the edge of my peripheral vision
HLCL-1573|he wore a suit like Trump's the little baggy at I like Trump's way too long and actual Trump brand cufflinks and a trump brand watch he found on eBay
HLCL-1574|three and a half inch height nur's Shrugged and mugged like Trump I didn't know whether to applaud or fire him
HLCL-1575|the weeks that Philippe spent studying tapes of trump in the Republican debates paid off
HLCL-1576|he knew how Trump's mind worked
HLCL-1577|Social Security would take Trump on a twisted journey into government waste undocumented immigrants and terrorism always terrorism
HLCL-1578|he would say the craziest things which I know Philippe is capable of doing all on his own but he made clear to us from that first day that ninety percent of what he'd say was straight from the horse's mouth
HLCL-1579|with the remaining 10% being his best guess as to what Trump would say
HLCL-1580|I never knew which was which in the end Trump hardly said a thing in any of the debates that I was hearing for the first time
HLCL-1581|it quickly became evident that are normal debate prep wouldn't work this time answer any question directly
HLCL-1582|he was rarely linear in his thinking or speaking
HLCL-1583|he regressed into nonsense and then depressed even more there was no point in refuting his arguments like a normal debate it was almost impossible to identify with his arguments
HLCL-1584|especially since they changed minute-to-minute
HLCL-1585|winning we realize would mean hitting hard says he couldn't bear it staying cool since he often resorted to viciousness when corner
HLCL-1586|throwing his own words back at him since he couldn't stand hearing them and making my own arguments with Clarity and precision since he couldn't do the same for himself
HLCL-1587|last practice before the first debate I walked into find filippas Trump and Ron is me practicing the opening handshake
HLCL-1588|they were joking but you just meet in the middle and Shake Hands there was a question of whether Trump will try to hug or dare I say it kiss me
HLCL-1589|not out of affinity or chivalry but rather to create a moment where he would Tower over me making it clear he was a guy and I was a girl
HLCL-1590|fair enough I said let's practice Philippe came at me with
HLCL-1591|arms outstretched I tried to stiff arm and then get away it ended with him literally chasing me across the room putting me in a bear hug and kissing the back of my head what can I say we were committed if you haven't seen it it's worth pulling up on YouTube
HLCL-1592|it stopped being funny we saw the Access Hollywood tape
HLCL-1593|I was not going to shake that man's hand
HLCL-1594|in the actual debate I think my body language made it pretty clear he should stay away and he did
HLCL-1595|but route that debate which was town hall-style meeting we weren't confined to standing at podiums and could walk around the stage Trump's talked and worked felipa done the same thing during prep
HLCL-1596|several times a session and we had 21 of them in the general just as he had warned Philippe as Trump would say something so outlandish none of us could
HLCL-1597|I believe it then he tell us it was almost verbatim from a trump rally interview or primary debate
HLCL-1598|one day Philippe has Trump started complaining about how the Mike guy screwed up and the Mike guy shouldn't get paid
HLCL-1599|we were totally confused but kept going
HLCL-1600|when the 90-minute session was over I asked who is Mike
HLCL-1601|it turns out he was saying Mike die
HLCL-1602|Philippe explain that on two occasions
HLCL-1603|Trump blame the microphone for bad audio and said the contractor shouldn't get paid
HLCL-1604|after his dismal performance in the first debate Trump really did say it was because his mic had been stabbed advised Philippe had called it
HLCL-1605|Indiana and thanks to our practice sessions I felt that deep sense of confidence that comes with rigorous preparation
HLCL-1606|like accepting the nomination these debates were a first for me
HLCL-1607|the pressure you feel when you're about to walk onstage is almost unbearable
HLCL-1608|almost but not quite you bear it by working hard to get ready you Barrett by having good people by your side you Barrett by not just hoping knowing you can handle a lot because you already have
HLCL-1609|at least that's what always worked for me
HLCL-1610|no matter how I spent the day or where in the country I happen to be I always called bill before falling asleep
HLCL-1611|we catch each other up on the latest news about the election or what was happening with our family and friends
HLCL-1612|sometimes we vented frustrations about how the campaign was going
HLCL-1613|then we take a moment to figure out when we see each other next and say goodnight
HLCL-1614|I'd fall asleep feeling, and wake up in the morning
HLCL-1615|new energy and a list of new ideas to pursue
HLCL-1616|even on the hardest days those conversations kept me grounded and at peace
HLCL-1617|it is hard to be a woman you must think like a man act like a lady look like a young girl like a horse
HLCL-1618|a sign that hangs in my house Sisterhood
HLCL-1619|above all be the heroine of your life not the victim
HLCL-1620|Nora Ephron on being a woman in politics
HLCL-1621|in these pages I put the paper years worth of frustration about the tightrope that I and other women have had to walk in order to participate in American politics
HLCL-1622|I have a lot to say I could fill an entire book
HLCL-1623|and not all of it is upbeat or even tempered
HLCL-1624|but there is joy and pride to be found in this chapter 2
HLCL-1625|my experiences as a woman and politics have been komplex and disappointing at times but ultimately rewarding beyond measure
HLCL-1626|in politics the personal narrative is vital
HLCL-1627|my husband had a powerful story to tell
HLCL-1628|he lived for a while on a farm with no indoor plumbing
HLCL-1629|his father died before he was born he stopped his stepfather from beating his mother
HLCL-1630|he became the first in his family to go to college
HLCL-1631|Barack Obama had a powerful story to tell
HLCL-1632|he was raised by his teenage mom and grandparents his father was Kenyan he spent part of his childhood living in Indonesia
HLCL-1633|and grew up to become a community organizer and law professor who story could have been written only in America
HLCL-1634|few people would say that my story was quite so dazzling
HLCL-1635|I grew up in a white middle-class family in Park Ridge a suburb of Chicago
HLCL-1636|my dad served during WWII and left every morning for his small business in the city
HLCL-1637|along with all the other fathers in our neighborhood heading to their jobs
HLCL-1638|my mom stayed home to take care of my brothers who and Tony and me like all the mothers in our neighborhood
HLCL-1639|and my wife looked like the lives of all the girls I knew
HLCL-1640|attended excellent public or parochial schools first grade teachers had high expectations for us
HLCL-1641|I went to our local Methodist Church for Sunday services and youth activities all week long
HLCL-1642|I was a brownie then Girl Scouts I got my first job when I was 13 working at a park three mornings a week
HLCL-1643|My Hangouts work everyone's Hangouts the public library movie theater swimming pools skating rinks my family watch TV together at night
HLCL-1644|when the Beatles perform for the first time on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 my friends and I gather together around the screen alternate Lee silently had shrieking with Glee
HLCL-1645|it's a story that many would consider perfectly ordinary
HLCL-1646|don't get me wrong I loved my childhood and every year that passes I appreciate more how hard my parents worked to give it to me
HLCL-1647|but my story or at least how I've always told it was never the kind of narrative that made everyone sit up and take notice
HLCL-1648|we yearn for that show stopping tail that one-sentence pitch that's cap
HLCL-1649|there's something magical about America that hooks you and won't let go
HLCL-1650|mine wasn't it yet there is another story of my life one that I believe is as inspiring as any other
HLCL-1651|I wish I had claimed it more publicly and told it more proudly
HLCL-1652|it's the story of a revolution when everything was changing for women
HLCL-1653|families were changing jobs were changing laws were changing
HLCL-1654|views about women that had governed our lives for Millennia were changing finally
HLCL-1655|I came along at just the right moment like a surfer catching the perfect wave
HLCL-1656|everything I am everything I've done so much of what I stand for flows from that happy accident of fate
HLCL-1657|the fact that the women's movement happened alongside the Civil Rights Movement indeed was entwined with it in many ways compelling America
HLCL-1658|entrenched Notions of human value and opening doors of opportunity that had previously been sealed shut to Millions made it that much more thrilling and meaningful
HLCL-1659|I know that for a lot of people including a lot of women
HLCL-1660|the movement for women's equality exists largely in the past that it's still happening still as urgent and vital as ever
HLCL-1661|and it was and is the Story of My Life mine and millions of other women's we share it we wrote it together we're still riding
HLCL-1662|and even though this isn't something women are supposed to do I haven't just been a participant in this revolution has helped lead it
HLCL-1663|I was one of just 27 women out of 235 students in my class at Yale Law School
HLCL-1664|the first woman partner at the oldest law firm in Arkansas the first woman to chair the national board of the Legal Services Corporation
HLCL-1665|the person who declared on the world stage that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights
HLCL-1666|the first first lady to be elected to public office the first woman senator from New York in fact for a few weeks I was both
HLCL-1667|by a quirk of the calendar I was sworn in before Bill left office
HLCL-1668|and I was the first woman to be nominated for president by a major political party and win the national popular vote
HLCL-1669|I never figured out how to tell this story right partly that's because I'm not talking about myself also I didn't want people to see me as quote woman candidate on quote which I find limiting but rather as the best candidate whose experience as a woman in a male-dominated culture
HLCL-1670|made her sharper tougher and more confident
HLCL-1671|that's a hard distinction to draw and I wasn't confident that I have the dexterity to pull it off
HLCL-1672|but the biggest reason I shied away from embracing this narrative
HLCL-1673|is that storytelling requires a receptive audience and I've never felt like the American electorate was receptive to this one
HLCL-1674|I wish so badly we were a country where a candidate who said my story is a story of a life shaped by and devoted to the movement for women's Liberation would be cheered not Jared
HLCL-1675|but that's not who we are not yet
HLCL-1676|maybe it's because we take this story for granted yeah yeah the women's movement happened why are we still talking about it maybe it's two female maybe it's at once too big a sweeping historical shift
HLCL-1677|and too small just another middle-class Midwestern girl finding her way in the world
HLCL-1678|I do think it's special it's not a typical political narrative but it's mine
HLCL-1679|this has to be said sexism and misogyny played a role in the 2016 presidential election
HLCL-1680|exhibit is that the flagrantly sexist candidate won
HLCL-1681|a whole lot of people listened to the tape of him bragging about sexually assaulting women Shrugged and said he still gets my vote
HLCL-1682|but Donald Trump didn't invent sexism and its impact on our politics goes far beyond this one election
HLCL-1683|it's like a planet that astronomers haven't precisely located yet but know exist because they can see its impact on other planets orbits
HLCL-1684|gravity's sexism exerts its pull on our politics and our society everyday in ways both subtle and crystal-clear
HLCL-1685|I know she run terminology others might have a different view but here's how I see the distinction between sexism and misogyny
HLCL-1686|husband tells his wife I can't quite explain why and I don't even like admitting this but I don't want you to make more money than me so please don't take that amazing job offer
HLCL-1687|that's sexism he could still love her deeply and be a great partner in countless ways but he holds tight to an idea that even he knows isn't fair about how successful a woman is allowed to be
HLCL-1688|sexism is all the big and little ways that Society draws a box around women and says
HLCL-1689|you stay in there
HLCL-1690|don't complain because nice girls don't do that
HLCL-1691|don't try to be something women shouldn't be don't wear that don't go there don't think that don't learn too much
HLCL-1692|it's not right somehow we can't explain why stop asking
HLCL-1693|we can do sexism from time to time often without even noticing it
HLCL-1694|most of us try to keep an eye out for those moments and avoid them or when we do misstep apologize and do better next time
HLCL-1695|misogyny is something darker its rage disgust hatred
HLCL-1696|it's what happens when a woman turns down a guy at a bar and he switches from Charming to scary
HLCL-1697|or when a woman gets a job that a man wanted and instead of shaking her hand and wishing her well he calls her a b**** and Val
HLCL-1698|do everything he can to make sure she fails
HLCL-1699|both sexism and misogyny are endemic in America
HLCL-1700|if you need convincing just look at the YouTube comments or Twitter replies when a woman dares to voice a political opinion or even just share an anecdote from her own lived experience
HLCL-1701|people hiding in the shadows step forward just far enough to rip her apart
HLCL-1702|sexism in particular can be so pervasive we stop seeing it
HLCL-1703|it reminds me of the opening anecdote from author David Foster Wallace's 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College
HLCL-1704|two young fish are swimming along they meet an older fish swimming the other way who nods at them and says morning boys how's the water
HLCL-1705|the two young fish swim on for a bit until
HLCL-1706|looks at the other end asks what's water
HLCL-1707|in other words Wallace said the most obvious realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about
HLCL-1708|I'd say that sums up the problem of recognizing sexism especially when it comes to politics quite nicely
HLCL-1709|it's not easy to be a woman in politics
HLCL-1710|that's an understatement it can be excruciatingly humiliating
HLCL-1711|the moment a woman steps forward and says I'm running for office it begins
HLCL-1712|analysis ever face her body her voice her demeanor the diminishment of her stature her ideas her accomplishments her integrity
HLCL-1713|it can be unbelievably cruel
HLCL-1714|I hesitate to write this because I know that women who should run for office my hear it and say
HLCL-1715|thanks and I passionately believe that the only way we're going to get sexism out of politics is by getting more women into politics
HLCL-1716|I can't think of a single woman and politics who doesn't have stories to tell not one
HLCL-1717|for the record it hurts to be torn apart
HLCL-1718|it may seem like it doesn't bother me to be called terrible names or have my look smocked viciously but it does
HLCL-1719|I'm used to it I've grown what Eleanor Roosevelt said women and politics need a skin as thick as a rhinoceros hide
HLCL-1720|plus I've always had a healthy self-esteem thanks no doubt to my parents who never once told me that I had to worry about being prettier or thinner
HLCL-1721|I was great exactly how I was
HLCL-1722|I don't know what magic they performed to make that stick in my head
HLCL-1723|all these years I wish I did so that parents everywhere could learn the trick
HLCL-1724|all I know is I've been far less plagued by self-doubt that a lot of women I know
HLCL-1725|and yet it hurts to be torn apart
HLCL-1726|it didn't start with running for office when I got glasses in the fourth grade later in life I was dubbed For Eyes it wasn't the most original taunt but it's done
HLCL-1727|in junior high a few unkind schoolmates notice the lack of ankles on my sturdy legs and did their best to embarrass me
HLCL-1728|I did talk to my mom about that one she told me to ignore it to rise above to be better
HLCL-1729|that advice prepared me well for a barrage of insults later on
HLCL-1730|at College I was spared some of the hostility many young women face because I
HLCL-1731|Wellesley being at a women's college offered me the freedom to take risks make mistakes and even fail without making me question my fundamental worth
HLCL-1732|it also gave me opportunities to lead that I wouldn't have had a co-ed college at that time
HLCL-1733|but once I left Wellesley things changed
HLCL-1734|my friend and I went to take the admissions test in 1968
HLCL-1735|we were among the only women in the room
HLCL-1736|we were waiting for the test to start when a group of young men started harassing us you don't need to be here why don't you go home and get married
HLCL-1737|one said if you take my spot at law school I'll get drafted and I'll go to Vietnam and I'll die
HLCL-1738|it was intense and personal
HLCL-1739|I just kept my eyes down hoping the Proctor would come to start the test trying hard
HLCL-1740|let them rattle me there was a professor at Harvard Law School and eager college senior recently offered admission and said
HLCL-1741|we don't need any more women at Harvard
HLCL-1742|that's part of why I went to jail
HLCL-1743|when I started out as an attorney I would take cases and small rural courthouses in Arkansas and people would come to watch the lady lawyer it was such a novelty
HLCL-1744|you could hear them commenting from the gallery on what I was wearing and how my hair look
HLCL-1745|one time in the early 1980s I was trying a case in Batesville Arkansas and in the middle of the trial in walked six men in full camouflage
HLCL-1746|they came in and sat right behind the lawyers and just stared hard at me
HLCL-1747|as any woman who's experienced that kind of staring nose was truly an
HLCL-1748|afterward the bailiff explained that it was deer season and these Hunters had come into town from their camp for supplies when they heard that a woman was trying a case in court they had to see it for themselves
HLCL-1749|I thought of that a few years later when a woman doctor came to Arkansas from California to be an expert witness in a trial for my firm
HLCL-1750|short spiky hair my boss the lead attorney on the case told her to go buy a wig
HLCL-1751|otherwise he said the jurors wouldn't be able to hear what she had to say
HLCL-1752|they'd be too focused on how she didn't look like a normal woman
HLCL-1753|I remember had taken aback she was at this request I would have been to not so long before but by then I wasn't
HLCL-1754|that saddens me I'd become used to a narrower set of expectations
HLCL-1755|what's Bill enter Politics the spotlight on me was glaring and often unkind
HLCL-1756|I've written about this before but it's worth saying again one of the reasons he lost the governor's race in 1980 was because I still went by my maiden name
HLCL-1757|let that sink in for a moment and please imagine how it felt
HLCL-1758|I was naive would tear maybe people would even respect what it said about our marriage that I wanted to preserve my pre Bill identity that I was proud of my parents and wanted to honor them that bill supported my choices
HLCL-1759|we lost and I heard over and over that my name my name had played a part I was heartsick that I might have inadvertently hurt my husband and let down his team
HLCL-1760|and I question whether there was room in public life for women like
HLCL-1761|who might appear slightly unconventional but still had so much to offer
HLCL-1762|so I added Clinton to Hillary
HLCL-1763|I asked my friends for hair makeup and clothing advice that's never come easily to me and until then I didn't care
HLCL-1764|but if wearing contact lenses or changing my wardrobe would make people feel more comfortable around me I'd try it
HLCL-1765|later when Bill was running for president for the first time I stumbled again
HLCL-1766|I now have the right name or makeup style my hair
HLCL-1767|but I hadn't changed my tongue opponent in the primary
HLCL-1768|this really got under my skin I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teased I told the press and exasperation
HLCL-1769|but what I decided to do was pursue my profession
HLCL-1770|that didn't the middle of a full-blown political Firestorm with self-righteous Morales saying I had insulted American mothers
HLCL-1771|as someone who believes in supporting mothers Fathers and Families of all times this hurt
HLCL-1772|and once again I feared that my pursuit of my individual dreams in this case my career which meant so much to me would end up hurting my husband
HLCL-1773|none of these experiences made me Retreat from my beliefs
HLCL-1774|but I've never really been naive again not much surprises me anymore
HLCL-1775|throughout the 2016 campaign my staff would come to me wide-eyed you'll never believe what Trump said today it was vile
HLCL-1776|I always believed it not just because of who Trump is but because if we can be at our
HLCL-1777|we've seen it too many times to be surprised
HLCL-1778|in my experience The Balancing Act women and politics have to master is challenging at every level
HLCL-1779|but it gets worse the higher you rise
HLCL-1780|if we're too tough unlikable if we're too soft we're not cut out for the big leagues
HLCL-1781|if we work too hard or neglecting our families if we put Family First we're not serious about the work
HLCL-1782|if we have a career but no children there's something wrong with us and vice versa
HLCL-1783|if we want to compete for a higher office we're too ambitious can't we just be happy with what we have can't we leave the higher rungs on the ladder for men
HLCL-1784|think how often you've heard these words used about women who lead
HLCL-1785|angry strident feisty difficult irritable bossy brassy emotional abrasive high-maintenance and vicious
HLCL-1786|a word that I think of is neutral he's an admirable but clearly isn't for a lot of people
HLCL-1787|the linguist George lakoff both identify this problem and embodied it when he said about Senator Elizabeth Warren
HLCL-1788|Elizabeth has a problem she is shrill and there is a prejudice against shrill women
HLCL-1789|how about we stop criticizing how she speaks which is just fine by the way and start paying attention to what she has to say about families and the economy
HLCL-1790|we're also called divisive untrustworthy unlikable and inauthentic
HLCL-1791|those words ring powerfully for me
HLCL-1792|as the campaign went on a show that a significant number of Americans questioned my authenticity and trustworthiness
HLCL-1793|a lot of people said they just didn't like me I write that matter-of-factly but believe me it's devastating
HLCL-1794|some of this is a direct result of my actions I've made mistakes and defensive about them stubbornly resisted apologizing
HLCL-1795|but so have most men in politics
HLCL-1796|in fact one of them just became president with a strategy of never apologize when you're wrong just attack harder
HLCL-1797|I've been called divisive more times than I can count for the life of me I can't understand why
HLCL-1798|politics is a divisive business it's true and our country has gotten more polarized with every passing year
HLCL-1799|but what specifically did I do that was so unacceptable
HLCL-1800|run for office lots of men do
HLCL-1801|work on Healthcare one of the most contentious issues in America
HLCL-1802|cast votes of a senator so did my 99 colleagues
HLCL-1803|when it comes to some of my most controversial actions like my vote giving President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq I was far from alone
HLCL-1804|that doesn't make it right but it also doesn't explain the Venom targeted at me specifically
HLCL-1805|why am I seeing as such a divisive figure and say Joe Biden and John Kerry aren't
HLCL-1806|they've run for president they've served at high levels of government they've cast votes of all kinds including someday regret just like me
HLCL-1807|what makes me such a lightning rod for Fury
HLCL-1808|I'm really asking I'm at a loss
HLCL-1809|I know some of the distrust people feel toward me is be
HLCL-1810|they watched as I've been sucked into partisan investigations over the years water travelgate emails at significant taxpayer expense
HLCL-1811|but I think there's another explanation for the skepticism I've faced in public life I think it's partly because I'm a woman
HLCL-1812|hear me out historical women haven't been the ones riding or leading the armies and navies
HLCL-1813|we're not the ones up there behind the podium rallying crowd uniting the country it's men who laid its men who speak it's man who represent us to the world and even to ourselves
HLCL-1814|that's been the case for so long that it has infiltrated our deepest thoughts
HLCL-1815|I suspect that for many of us more than we might think
HLCL-1816|it feels somehow off to picture a woman president sitting in the Oval Office or The Situation Room
HLCL-1817|it's discordant to tune into a political rally and hear a woman's voice booming screaming screeching for it
HLCL-1818|even the simple Act of a woman standing up and speaking to a crowd is relatively new
HLCL-1819|think about it we know of only a handful of speeches by women before the latter half of the 20th century
HLCL-1820|and those tend to be by women in extreme and desperate situations
HLCL-1821|Joan of arc's had a lot of interesting things before they burned her at the stake
HLCL-1822|meanwhile when a woman lands a political punch and not even a particularly hard one
HLCL-1823|it's not red is the normal sparring that men do all the time in politics
HLCL-1824|it makes her a nasty woman
HLCL-1825|a lot of women have had that spat in their faces and worse
HLCL-1826|for saying not that much at all God forbid to women have a disagreement in public then it's a catfight
HLCL-1827|insured it's not customary to have women lead or even to engage in the rough-and-tumble of politics
HLCL-1828|it's not normal not yet
HLCL-1829|so when it happens it often doesn't feel quite right
HLCL-1830|that may sound vague but it's potent people cast their votes based on feelings like that all the time
HLCL-1831|I think this question of rightness is connected to another powerful but undefinable forest in politics authenticity
HLCL-1832|I've been asked over and over again by reporters and skeptical voters who are you
HLCL-1833|is it kind of funny question when you think about it
HLCL-1834|I'm Hillary you've seen me in the papers and on your screens for more than 25 years I'll bet you know more about my private life than you do about some of your closest friends
HLCL-1835|you read my emails for heaven's sakes what more do you need
HLCL-1836|what could I do to be more real
HLCL-1837|dance on a table swear a Blue Streak breakdown sobbing
HLCL-1838|that's not me and if I have done any of those things what would have happened I'd have been ripped to pieces
HLCL-1839|again I wonder what it is about me that mystifies people
HLCL-1840|when there are so many men in politics who are far less scrutinized interviewed photographed intestine
HLCL-1841|yeah they're asked so much less frequently to open up reveal themselves prove that they're real
HLCL-1842|this has to do with my composure
HLCL-1843|people say I'm guarded and they have a point
HLCL-1844|I think before I speak I don't just blurt out whatever comes to mind
HLCL-1845|It's a combination of my natural inclination plus my training as a lawyer plus decades in the public eye every word I say is scrutinized
HLCL-1846|why is this a bad thing don't we want our Senators and secretaries of state and especially our presidents to speak thoughtfully to respect the impact of our words
HLCL-1847|President Obama is just as controlled as I am maybe even more so
HLCL-1848|he speaks with a great deal of care takes his time ways his words
HLCL-1849|this is generally and correctly taken as evidence of his intellectual heft and rigor
HLCL-1850|he's a serious person talking about serious things
HLCL-1851|so am I and yet for me it's often experienced as a negative
HLCL-1852|even some fair-minded people who want to like me feel that there's something to controlled about how I speak
HLCL-1853|often it's just about finding the right words
HLCL-1854|and impulsive doesn't mean the same thing as truthful
HLCL-1855|just look at Donald Trump still there's no denying that my cautiousness has had the effect of making some people feel like they weren't getting the unvarnished
HLCL-1856|which in turn prompted the question what is she hiding
HLCL-1857|this frustrated me to no end and I never figured out how to solve it I'm not sure there was a solution
HLCL-1858|it's another variant on the impossible Balancing Act
HLCL-1859|if we're too composed recalled or fake
HLCL-1860|but if we say what we think without caution we get slammed for it
HLCL-1861|can you blame us for feeling like we can't win no matter what we do
HLCL-1862|consider another emotional act crying
HLCL-1863|I can think of many male politicians who have teared up from time to time
HLCL-1864|some have been mocked for it Senator Ed muskies political career was all but scuttled by his tears in the 1972 New Hampshire primary
HLCL-1865|even though it may have just been snow blowing in his eyes
HLCL-1866|but many men have been treated with compassion and even admiration for their displays of emotion
HLCL-1867|Ronald Reagan George h.w. Bush my husband George W bush Barack Obama that moments of high sentiment
HLCL-1868|that makes sense because they are humans and sometimes humans cry
HLCL-1869|but when a woman cries it can be viewed far less charitable
HLCL-1870|I remember what happened to Pat Schroeder the talented and hilarious congresswoman from Colorado who considered running for president in 1987
HLCL-1871|she ultimately decided against it and when she held a press conference to announce that she cried for about 3 seconds
HLCL-1872|today when you type Pat Roeder into Google the very first suggestion is Pat Roeder crying
HLCL-1873|20 years later she was still receiving hate mail because of it mostly from women who felt like she let them.
HLCL-1874|I had my own stained tearful moment just before the New Hampshire Primary in 2008
HLCL-1875|I didn't even cry not really I was talking about running for office can be because it can be very tough
HLCL-1876|and my eyes glisten for a moment and my voice quavered for about one sentence
HLCL-1877|that was it it became the biggest news story in America
HLCL-1878|it will no doubt Merida line in my obituary someday
HLCL-1879|her eyes once watered on camera
HLCL-1880|interesting Lee many would say that my tears turned out to be a good thing for me
HLCL-1881|dozens if not hundreds of pundits have commented about how that moment humanized me
HLCL-1882|maybe that's true if so I'm both fine with that and a little bit at the reminder that yet again required humanizing at all
HLCL-1883|still some sought to capitalize on my perceived vulnerability in the press and on the campaign Trail
HLCL-1884|when he was asked about my tears
HLCL-1885|Senator John Edwards of North Carolina still in the presidential race at the time jumped at the chance to call me week
HLCL-1886|I think what we need in a commander and chief is strength and resolve he said
HLCL-1887|presidential campaigns are a tough business but being president of United States is also a very tough business and the president of the United States is faced with very very difficult challenges every single day and difficult judgements every single day
HLCL-1888|what I know is that I'm prepared for that
HLCL-1889|shortly after he dropped out
HLCL-1890|in any case this whole topic of being real
HLCL-1891|can feel very silly I wish we could just dismiss it and go about our business being whoever we are without worrying about whether we are satisfying some indefinable standard of realness
HLCL-1892|Nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie rights
HLCL-1893|it's not your job to be likable it's your job to be yourself
HLCL-1894|yet the issues of authenticity and likeability have an impact on the most consequential election of our lifetime
HLCL-1895|and it will have an impact on future ones so there's something extremely serious going on here too
HLCL-1896|especially since crude abusive fat-free rhetoric was characterized as authentic in 2016
HLCL-1897|I tried to adjust after hearing repeatedly that some people didn't like my voice I Enlisted the help of a linguistic expert
HLCL-1898|he said I needed to focus on my deep-breathing and try to keep something happy and peaceful in mind when I went on stage
HLCL-1899|that way when the proud energized and started shouting
HLCL-1900|Woods at Rally's 10 to do I could resist doing the normal thing
HLCL-1901|content but not
HLCL-1902|okay I told this expert I'm game to try
HLCL-1903|but out of curiosity can you give me an example of a woman public life
HLCL-1904|the energy while keeping her voice soft and low
HLCL-1905|he could not I'm not sure how to solve all this my gender is my gender my voice is my voice
HLCL-1906|the quote Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins the first woman to serve in the u.s. cabinet under f.d.r.
HLCL-1907|the accusation that I'm a woman is incontrovertible
HLCL-1908|other women will run for president and they will be women and they will have women's voices Maybe
HLCL-1909|will be less unusual by then maybe my campaign will have helped make it that way and other women will have an easier time I hope so
HLCL-1910|near the start of my campaign I met with my friend Sheryl Sandberg the Chief Operating Officer of Facebook who has thought about these issues a great deal
HLCL-1911|she told me that if there was one thing she wanted everyone to know from her book lean in women work and the will to lead its this
HLCL-1912|the data shows that four men likability and professional success are correlated
HLCL-1913|the more successful man is the more people like him
HLCL-1914|with women it's the exact opposite
HLCL-1915|the more professionally successful we are the less people like us
HLCL-1916|curing it put that simply with data behind it
HLCL-1917|like a light turning on here was proof of something so many women have felt intuitively throughout our lives
HLCL-1918|Cheryl shared another inside
HLCL-1919|women are seen favorably when they advocate for others but unfavorably when they advocate for themselves
HLCL-1920|for example there's virtually no downside to asking for a raise if you're a man
HLCL-1921|you'll either get it or you won't but either way you won't be penalized for trying
HLCL-1922|a woman who does the same is more likely to pay a price
HLCL-1923|even if she gets a salary bump she lose a measure of Goodwill
HLCL-1924|the exception is when a woman asks for a raise on someone else's behalf
HLCL-1925|then she seen as generous and a team player
HLCL-1926|this to resonated with me
HLCL-1927|people like me when I'm in a supporting role
HLCL-1928|campaigning for my husband serving as a member of President Obama's cabinet
HLCL-1929|it's okay for me to be a fierce advocate in those capacities
HLCL-1930|but when I stand up and say now I'd like a chance to lead Everything Changes
HLCL-1931|you have a steep mountain to climb Cheryl warned that day they will have no empathy for you
HLCL-1932|it's not easy for any woman in politics but I think it's safe to say that I got a whole other level of vitriol swing my way
HLCL-1933|crowds at Trump rallies called for my imprisonment more times than I can count they shouted guilty guilty like the religious zealots in Game of Thrones chanting Shame Shame while Searcy
HLCL-1934|Lester walked back to the red keep has Susan Bordeaux a Pulitzer prize-nominated gender studies Professor put it in her book the destruction of Hillary Clinton
HLCL-1935|it was almost medieval Mary beard the classics professor at the University of Cambridge observed that this Venom hearken back to an even earlier time
HLCL-1936|one popular image among Trump supporters found on everything from t-shirts to coffee mugs depicted Trump holding up my severed head like Perseus from ancient Greek mythology lifting High the head of Medusa
HLCL-1937|what in the world was this I've been in politics for a long time but I was taken aback by the flood of hatred that seemed only to grow as we got closer to election day
HLCL-1938|I left the state department one of the most admired Publix
HLCL-1939|Benson America now people seem to think I was evil
HLCL-1940|not just not my cup of tea but evil
HLCL-1941|it was flabbergasting and frightening
HLCL-1942|was this all because I'm a woman
HLCL-1943|I believe it was motivation for some of those chanters and some of that vile
HLCL-1944|L I read interview with Margaret Atwood the prescient author of the handmaid's tale which put the campaign into yet another historical light
HLCL-1945|you can find websites that say Hillary was actually a Satanist with demonic Powers she said
HLCL-1946|it's so seventeenth-century that you can hardly believe it
HLCL-1947|the Puritan witch hunts may be long over but something fanatical about unruly women still lurks in our national subconscious
HLCL-1948|that doesn't just affect me and other candidates it affects our supporters
HLCL-1949|nearly 4 million people joined a Facebook group supporting my campaign fittingly called pantsuit Nation
HLCL-1950|it was a secret group it had to be
HLCL-1951|otherwise its members were exposing themselves to vicious sexist online harassment from both the right and the left
HLCL-1952|you can hardly open a newspaper these days without reading another Grimm story female Engineers reporting blatant harassment in Silicon Valley women entrepreneurs making pitches to investment firms and being propositioned in response
HLCL-1953|a new study finding that women are given a harder time than men in job interviews another finding that women are penalized when they declined to reveal their salary history will men end up making more
HLCL-1954|when they do the same that's why it's so maddening the basic fact that sexism is alive and well should still be up for debate
HLCL-1955|I can't count the number of times that good-hearted men who should know better dismissed the notion that sexism and misogyny are still potent forces in our national life
HLCL-1956|but things have changed they say as Donald Trump brags about groping women and a few weeks later wins the presidency
HLCL-1957|as his rally-goers chant Trump that b**** as a White House proudly releases photos of old white men gleefully deciding which Health Services to take away from women
HLCL-1958|and on that fundamental question of whether it would be good to see a woman any woman not just me become president the electorate is deeply depressingly divided
HLCL-1959|a2014 in Pew Research Center poll found that 69% of democratic women and 46% of democratic men not terrible but you can do better than that Democratic man said they hoped to see a female president in their lifetime
HLCL-1960|but only 20% of Republican women and only 16% of Republican men did
HLCL-1961|in 2008 researchers found that more than a quarter of the population expressed anger or upset feelings at the mere thought of a female president
HLCL-1962|after the 2016 election the diandy Blair Center of Southern politics and Society at the University of Arkansas put out a report on the impact of sexism on the race
HLCL-1963|researchers asked people to respond to five statements that reflect sexist thinking including seeking for women to have more power
HLCL-1964|end discrimination against women is no longer a problem in the United States
HLCL-1965|end results that surprised no one more than a third of respondents gave answers that were sexist
HLCL-1966|Trump voters were more sexist than Clinton voters Republicans were far more sexist than Democrats and not just men women were quite sexist to
HLCL-1967|on that note beginning even before I ran political commentators wondered whether I'd Inspire an unbeatable wave of women to come out and vote for me in the same way President Obama inspired record-breaking black turnout
HLCL-1968|I hoped I would of course but I had my doubts
HLCL-1969|gender hasn't proven to be the motivating force for Women Voters that some hope it might be
HLCL-1970|if it were we probably have had a woman president
HLCL-1971|don't you think in the end I want an overwhelming majority of the votes of black women 94% and Latino women 68%
HLCL-1972|Taiwan women overall by a safe margin 54%
HLCL-1973|but I failed to win a majority of white women although I did better with them than Obama did in 2012
HLCL-1974|yes things have changed some things are a lot better
HLCL-1975|but many are still bad and they are connected the bad is the backlash to the good
HLCL-1976|women's advancement has set into motion vast changes that Inspire intense feelings of all kinds some of us are exhilarated others feel a whole lot of rage
HLCL-1977|the good news and there is good news is that there's another side to all of this
HLCL-1978|it can also be deeply rewarding to be a woman in politics
HLCL-1979|you know that just by being in the room you're making government more representative of the people
HLCL-1980|you're bringing a vital perspective that would otherwise go unheard
HLCL-1981|that always made me stand up a little straighter
HLCL-1982|it's why I love the song the room where it happens from lin-manuel Miranda brilliant musical Hamilton
HLCL-1983|no one really knows how the game is played the art of the trade how the sausage gets made we just assume that it happens but no one else is in the room where it happens
HLCL-1984|it felt really good to be in a room where things happen the Oval Office the Senate chamber as an advocate for issues that matter to me education equal-pay Healthcare women's rights
HLCL-1985|maybe those issues would have been close to my heart even if I were a man but maybe not
HLCL-1986|eyes naturally pushed me in their Direction and Mom interested in policy off and ends up working on kids issues a first lady is often involved with women's issues that was okay with me some might have found it limited but I consider these real-life issues that affect us all
HLCL-1987|later I moved into different Realms working to rebuild New York after 9/11 as a HomeTown Senator supporting our troops and caring for our Wounded Warriors and all our vets as a member of the Senate armed services committee
HLCL-1988|keeping our country and World safe as US Secretary of State
HLCL-1989|I moved into different rooms The Situation Room for Ministries the United Nations and I found that the Decades of work I have done on women and families served me well in all those places because it meant that I understood the intricacies of people's lives
HLCL-1990|I knew how governments could help or hurt families I knew how to Marsh
HLCL-1991|resources and support to the people who needed it the most
HLCL-1992|it turned out that my work on so-called Women's and Children's issues prepared me well for nearly everything else I've ever done
HLCL-1993|I also believe the fact that I'm a woman is one reason why so many people open up to me about the details of their lives and Families
HLCL-1994|they tell me about their children's medical diagnosis their caregiving of Aging parents troubles in their marriages and families finances painful experiences with sexual harassment and discrimination
HLCL-1995|warm-hearted male politicians also receive these confessionals but from what I can see women hear them more often
HLCL-1996|maybe it's easier to cry in front of us maybe it feels like talking to a girlfriend
HLCL-1997|all I know is that a lot of people have grabbed my hand and told me they're worries and dreams and that's been a unique privilege
HLCL-1998|there's another thing that women confide in me about and that's stories of their reproductive health
HLCL-1999|no essay about women and politics could be complete without talking about this
HLCL-2000|it is such a central part of women's lives whether we become mothers and it what agent under what circumstances
HLCL-2001|reproductive health and all its complexity pregnancy fertility birth control miscarriage abortion labor birth
HLCL-2002|comprise some of the most joyful and terrifying moments we will ever experience
HLCL-2003|but a lot of the time we process these moments in silence
HLCL-2004|the stories go unspoken even among women
HLCL-2005|then I meet women at Rally's or dinners our fundraisers or just taking a walk and they take a deep breath and let it all out
HLCL-2006|at this moment in America more than 44 years since Roe v Wade women's access to birth control and abortion is still under constant threat
HLCL-2007|I saw the effectiveness in the 2016 election
HLCL-2008|reproductive Health was rarely mentioned in any of the primary debates and when it was mentioned it was often because I brought it up
HLCL-2009|I was just made when Bernie Sanders just miss Planned Parenthood as just another part of the establishment when they endorsed me over him
HLCL-2010|few organizations are as intimately connected to the day-to-day lives of Americans from all classes and backgrounds as planned parenthood and few are under more persistent attack
HLCL-2011|I'm not sure what establishment about that and I don't know why someone running to be the Democratic nominee for president would say so
HLCL-2012|after the election Bernie suggested the Democrats should be open to nominating and supporting candidates who are anti-choice
HLCL-2013|other topics such as economic Justice are sacrosanct but apparently women's health is not
HLCL-2014|I don't mean to criticize only for me hear a lot of progressive join him and thinking that Reproductive Rights are negotiable and to be clear I believe there's room in our party for a wide range of personal views on abortion
HLCL-2015|I've been working for a quarter-century with Democrats and Republicans alike to reduce the number of abortions in part by expanding access to birth control and Family Planning and we've made progress
HLCL-2016|and I picked as my running mate Tim Kaine a Democrat personally opposed to abortion because of his Catholic faith but supportive of women's rights as a matter of Law & policy
HLCL-2017|but when personal views on abortion become public actions legislation or judges or funding that erode women's rights that's a different matter
HLCL-2018|we have to remain a big tent but a big tent is only as strong as the poles that hold it up
HLCL-2019|Reproductive Rights are Central to women's rights and Women's Health
HLCL-2020|one of the most important temples we've got and remember it's a constitutional right as defined in Roe v Wade
HLCL-2021|there's overwhelming evidence about what happens when these rights are denied
HLCL-2022|Texas has defunded planned parenthood and refused to expand Medicaid and maternal mortality doubled between 2010 and 2014
HLCL-2023|that's the worst in the nation and it's higher than the rate in many developing countries
HLCL-2024|600 women have died in Texas not from abortions but from trying to give birth
HLCL-2025|the number of Texas teenagers having abortions actually increased when support for Family Planning with cut
HLCL-2026|in one County Greg it went up 191 per cent between 2012 and 2014
HLCL-2027|ultimately I'm pro-choice pro-family and prophase because I
HLCL-2028|believe that our ability to decide whether and when to become mothers is intrinsic to our Liberty
HLCL-2029|When government gets involved in this intimate realm weather in places like China would force women to have abortions or in communist Romania would force women to Bear children it is horrific
HLCL-2030|I visited hospitals in countries where poor women have no access to safe and legal abortion I've seen what happens when desperate women take matters into their own hands
HLCL-2031|as I see it this issue comes down to the question who decides
HLCL-2032|we can debate the morality of abortion forever and I have spent many hours engaged in such debates and surely will spend many more but at the end of the day who decides whether a woman gets or stays pregnant a congressman who has never met her a judge was spoken with her for maybe a few minutes or should the woman be able to make this momentous decision about her life her body perfume
HLCL-2033|for herself someone's got to decide I say let women decide
HLCL-2034|I'm not sure what we call our current ERA of feminism I've lost count of which wave were in but there's a lot that feels new
HLCL-2035|there are all these new words mansplaining the second I heard it I thought yes we needed a word for that
HLCL-2036|intersectionality an academic term for that engage race and class revenge p*** trolls modern Twist on Ancient arms
HLCL-2037|power defining things let's take a moment for feminism
HLCL-2038|the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the political economic and social equality of the sexes
HLCL-2039|not domination not oppression equality
HLCL-2040|or is the English writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft put a 225 years ago
HLCL-2041|I do not wish women to have power over men but over themselves
HLCL-2042|then there is emotional labor now that's a good one
HLCL-2043|it describes all the unpaid uncounted off an unseen work that people overwhelmingly women perform to keep their families and workplaces humming along
HLCL-2044|organizing office birthday parties arranging the kids summer camp coordinating visits with in-laws helping the new employee feel welcome and included
HLCL-2045|the list is endless all the little details without which life would devolve into chaos and misery
HLCL-2046|not all women take on these tasks and that's fine and some men do and I salute them but it's largely Woman's Work
HLCL-2047|finally someone thought to name it in my marriage I've definitely been the one to perform
HLCL-2048|the bulk of the emotional labor I'm the one who schedules family visits vacations and dinners with friends
HLCL-2049|bill has many positive qualities but managing the logistical details of a household is not one of them
HLCL-2050|of course our situation is unique for years he was a governor than the president he wasn't going to be the parent keeping track of the SAT registration deadline
HLCL-2051|we've also been privileged since moving into the governor's mansion years ago to have people helping ensure that were well fed and taken care of
HLCL-2052|neither of us has had to make an emergency run to the store to pick up milk and decades
HLCL-2053|still even our privileged lives require a lot of small but vital actions and decisions to keep rolling them
HLCL-2054|that labor extends to my friendships in March 27th
HLCL-2055|in a few of my close girlfriends came to New York for the weekend
HLCL-2056|a new friend joined us and asked how do you all know each other
HLCL-2057|that ledge my friends going around the table explaining in great detail how I have lovingly interfered in their lives over the years
HLCL-2058|when I got sick Hillary hounded me until I went to her doctor and called me immediately after for a full report
HLCL-2059|that's nothing when my little girl cut her face Hillary insisted I get a plastic surgeon and then called back 10 minutes later with the best one in Washington on the phone
HLCL-2060|they knew me well it happens at work to make sure everyone is eating that my staff is wearing sunscreen if we're at an event in the baking sun
HLCL-2061|when reporters who traveled abroad with us got sick or injured I made sure they had ginger ale and crackers and would send the state department doctor to their room is Cipro and anti-nausea drugs
HLCL-2062|none of this is unusual I've seen women CEOs her coffee at meetings women heads of state walked issues over to a sneezing staffer it's also not new
HLCL-2063|it was women like dr. Dorothy Hyde who did a lot of the unglamorous work of the Civil Rights Movement recruiting volunteers and organizing workshops and coordinating sit-ins and freedom rides it is women who do a lot of the daily knitting and Congress identifying problems bring together stakeholders
HLCL-2064|it's often women who handle constituent Outreach answering phones and responding two letters and emails
HLCL-2065|and in my experience make those calls and write those letters to Congress
HLCL-2066|we're not just the designated Warriors in our families were also the designated Warriors for our country
HLCL-2067|I think all this may help explain why women leaders around the world tend to rise higher in parliamentary systems rather than presidential ones like ours
HLCL-2068|Prime Ministers are chosen by their colleagues people they've worked with seen firsthand their talents and confidence it's a system designed to reward women's skill at building relationships which requires emotional labor
HLCL-2069|presidential systems aren't like that they reward different talents speaking a large crowds looking commanding on camera dominating and debates galvanizing mass movements in America raising a billion dollars
HLCL-2070|you got to give it to Trump he's hateful but it's hard to look away from him
HLCL-2071|he uses his size to project power he looms over the podium gets an interviewer's faces glowers threatens to punch people
HLCL-2072|I watch the video of one of our debates with the sound off and discovered that between his theatrical arm-waving and face making and his sheer size and aggressiveness him a lot more than I watch me
HLCL-2073|I'm guessing a lot of Voters did the same thing
HLCL-2074|I also suspect that if a woman was aggressive or melodramatic as he is should be laughed or booed off the stage
HLCL-2075|in the end even though I was judged to have won all three of our debates his supporters awarded him points for his hyper-masculine aggressive behavior
HLCL-2076|as for me when it comes to politics my style can be viewed as female
HLCL-2077|I've always focused on listening over speaking I like Town Hall meetings because I get to hear from people and ask follow-up questions to my heart's content
HLCL-2078|I prefer small group conversations to Big speeches and finding common ground over battling it out
HLCL-2079|I was a Senator I spent a lot of time getting to know my colleagues including Gruff Republicans who wanted nothing to do with me at first
HLCL-2080|in 2000 Trent Lott the Republican leader wistfully wondered if
HLCL-2081|would strike and I wouldn't take the oath of office by 2016 he was telling people I was a very capable who did a good job and he told my husband that I done more to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina that anyone outside the Gulf Coast
HLCL-2082|a number of other conservative Republicans also came to like me when I was their colleague in the Senate helping them pass bills refilling their coffee cups in the Senate dining room or sitting beside them in the Senate's private prayer meeting
HLCL-2083|1 Ultra conservative Senator came to see me to apologize for having hated me and saying terrible things about me over the years
HLCL-2084|he asked mrs. Clinton will you forgive me
HLCL-2085|I know this might sound incredible now but it's true I told him that of course I would
HLCL-2086|dramatic spiritual conversions aside emotional labor isn't particularly thrilling as far as the political Media or some of the electorate is concerned
HLCL-2087|I've been dating for being too interested in the details of policy to practical not inspiring to willing to compromise sellout too focused on small establishment candidate
HLCL-2088|but just as a household falls apart without emotional labor so does politics grind to a halt if no one is actually listening to One Another for reading the briefings or making plans that have a chance of working
HLCL-2089|I guess that might be considered boring boring but you might
HLCL-2090|but here's the thing someone has to do it
HLCL-2091|in my experience a lot of the time it's women
HLCL-2092|a lot of the time it's dismissed as not that important
HLCL-2093|and I don't think that's a coincidence
HLCL-2094|this is not okay I thought
HLCL-2095|it was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me
HLCL-2096|2 days before the world heard him brag about groping women
HLCL-2097|now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked he followed me closely staring at me making faces
HLCL-2098|it was incredibly uncomfortable he was literally breathing down my neck my skin crawl
HLCL-2099|it was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching what would you do
HLCL-2100|do you stay calm keep smiling and carry on as if he weren't repeatedly invading your space
HLCL-2101|or do you turn look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly backup you creep get away from me
HLCL-2102|do you love to intimidate women but you can't intimidate me so back up
HLCL-2103|I chose option it I kept my cool dealing with difficult man trying to throw me off
HLCL-2104|I did however grip the microphone extra hard
HLCL-2105|I wonder though whether I should have chosen option b it certainly would have been
HLCL-2106|maybe I have over learned the lesson of staying calm biting my tongue digging my fingernails fist determined to present a composed face to the world
HLCL-2107|of course had I told trump.off he surely would have capitalized on its gleefully
HLCL-2108|a lot of people recoil from an angry woman or even just a direct one
HLCL-2109|look at what happened to Elizabeth Warren silence in the Senate chamber for reading a letter from Coretta Scott King
HLCL-2110|cuz it was critical Jeff sessions a male Senator during his confirmation hearing for attorney general
HLCL-2111|moments later Jeff Merkley a male Senator was allowed to read the letter
HLCL-2112|funny how that worked Senator Kamala Harris was derided as hysterical entirely cool-headed and professional questioning of Jeff sessions him again during a senate hearing
HLCL-2113|as one writer put it she was being Hillary
HLCL-2114|Arianna Huffington was recently interrupted in a meeting of the Uber board of directors when she was making a point about of all things how important it was to increase the number of women on the board
HLCL-2115|and the man who talked over her did so to say that increasing women would only mean more talking
HLCL-2116|you can't make this up in other words this isn't something that only happens to me not even close
HLCL-2117|it also doesn't just happen to women on the Democratic side of politics
HLCL-2118|Trump made fun of Carly fiorina's face because she competed against him for
HLCL-2119|he lashed out at Megyn Kelly and Mika Brzezinski in Gross physical terms because they challenged him
HLCL-2120|maybe that's why Nicole Wallace White House communications director for George W bush has warned that the Republican party is in danger of being permanently associated with misogyny if leaders don't stand up to Trump's treatment of women
HLCL-2121|this Harkens back to a powerful ad we ran during the campaign called mirrors
HLCL-2122|it shows adolescent girls looking tentatively at themselves in the mirror
HLCL-2123|talking their hair behind their ears evaluating their profile trying to decide if they are okay looking like so many girls do when they see themselves
HLCL-2124|over there images of cruel things Trump has said
HLCL-2125|the record about women over the years
HLCL-2126|she's a slob she ate like a pig I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers
HLCL-2127|was this the voice we wanted in our daughters heads our granddaughters are nieces
HLCL-2128|or our sons or grandsons or nephews heads for that matter
HLCL-2129|they deserve better than the toxic masculinity Trump embodies
HLCL-2130|his voice resounds far and wide
HLCL-2131|now it's on all of us to make sure his ugly words don't damage our girls and boys forever
HLCL-2132|2 days before the debate my team and I had finished a grueling morning debate prep session
HLCL-2133|we're taking a break for lunch the television was on in the room with no volume
HLCL-2134|commentator
HLCL-2135|about to hear something vulgar
HLCL-2136|I don't have a lot to say about the Access Hollywood tape that hasn't been said
HLCL-2137|I will just know that Donald Trump is gleefully described in committing sexual assault
HLCL-2138|that got somewhat lost in the shock of it all
HLCL-2139|too many people focused on his boorishness such a crude man so vulgar
HLCL-2140|true but even if he were the height of Elegance and graciousness
HLCL-2141|it wouldn't make it okay that he's describing sexual assault
HLCL-2142|for many in the Donald Trump tape was literally sickening
HLCL-2143|as for me it made me sad for when girls for men and boys for all of us
HLCL-2144|it was horrible just horrible
HLCL-2145|it still is and always will be
HLCL-2146|because that tape is never going away it's part of our history now
HLCL-2147|to divert attention from his own ugliness Trump brought to our second debate three women would accuse my husband of Bad Axe decades ago
HLCL-2148|puzzle woman who's accused rapist I have been ordered by a judge to represent back in Arkansas
HLCL-2149|it was an awful stunt I don't know what the Trump campaign was hoping to accomplish other than the obvious dredge up old allegations that have been litigated years before divert attention from the Access Hollywood tape throw me off my game and distract voters from the elections unbelievably high stakes
HLCL-2150|he wasn't trying to make a stand for these women
HLCL-2151|just using them this was a presidential debate that's a big deal
HLCL-2152|we were supposed to talk about issues that matter to people's lives
HLCL-2153|instead Trump use this moment to get back in his comfort zone
HLCL-2154|he loves to humiliate women loves to talk about how disgusting we are
HLCL-2155|he was helping to Rattle me I was determined not to give him that satisfaction
HLCL-2156|before I stepped onstage Ron klain said to me he's trying to get in your head
HLCL-2157|I said yes thank then I went out there and won the debate
HLCL-2158|something I wish every man Across America understood is how much fear accompanies women throughout our lives
HLCL-2159|so many of us have been threatened or harmed so many of us have helped friends recover from a traumatic incident
HLCL-2160|it's difficult to convey what all this violence does to us it adds up in our hearts and our nervous systems
HLCL-2161|a few years ago the hashtag yesallwomen was trending for a while
HLCL-2162|it spoke to me like it did to so many others
HLCL-2163|in college and law school a million defensive habits
HLCL-2164|old Yorkies like a weapon when you're out alone at night
HLCL-2165|many women I know have been groped grabbed or worse
HLCL-2166|it even happens to members of Congress senator Kirsten gillibrand has written frankly about Congressman have leered at her and grabbed her waist in a congressional gym
HLCL-2167|I'm very lucky that nothing too bad ever happened to me
HLCL-2168|one time in college I went on a blind date with a young man wouldn't take repeated nose for an answer and I had to slap him to get him away from me and I went to bed that night shaken but not traumatized
HLCL-2169|and when I was 29 working for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign in Indiana I had dinner one night with a group of older men who are in charge of the democratic party's get-out-the-vote operation in the state
HLCL-2170|I had been pestering them for awhile for information about their Election Day plans and they were annoyed with me
HLCL-2171|I started explaining once again what I needed to know from them and why
HLCL-2172|reach across the table
HLCL-2173|she's just in my face just shut up
HLCL-2174|I froze that managed to pull his hand from my neck tell him to never touch me again and walked out of the room and shaking legs
HLCL-2175|call incident probably lasted 30 seconds I'll never forget it
HLCL-2176|but that's nothing compared to the violence and millions of women and girls across our country and door on a regular basis
HLCL-2177|about four months before Donald Trump's Access Hollywood tape was released a very different message went viral
HLCL-2178|an unnamed woman known as Emily doe who have been sexually assaulted while unconscious wrote a letter about her ordeal and reading Court to her attacker a Stanford athlete
HLCL-2179|a friend forwarded the letter to me I read it once that immediate
HLCL-2180|went back to the beginning and read it again I hope I can meet the author someday and tell her how Brave I think she is
HLCL-2181|girls everywhere she wrote I Am With You
HLCL-2182|on nights when you feel alone I am with you
HLCL-2183|when people doubt you or dismiss you I am with you
HLCL-2184|I fought every day for you so never stop fighting I believe you
HLCL-2185|as the author Anne lamott wants Road
HLCL-2186|lighthouses don't go running all over an island looking for boats to save they just stand there Shining
HLCL-2187|although I can't say I hope that by speaking today you absorbed a small amount of light a small knowing that you can't be silenced a small satisfaction that Justice was served a small assurance that we are getting somewhere and a big big knowing that you are important unquestionably untouchable
HLCL-2188|beautiful you are to be valued respected undeniably every minute of every day you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you
HLCL-2189|early on the morning of November 9th when it came time to decide on what I say in my concession speech
HLCL-2190|I remember those words inspired by them I wrote These
HLCL-2191|to all the little girls were watching this never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams
HLCL-2192|wherever she is I hope Emily has how much her words and her strength meant to so many
HLCL-2193|there's yet another side to the matter of women in politics
HLCL-2194|it's not just that politics can be rewarding
HLCL-2195|those women who choose to enter it in the long run it also makes our politics better for everyone
HLCL-2196|I believe this as strongly as I believe anything we need our politics to resemble our people
HLCL-2197|when the people who are city-states and Country overwhelmingly look a certain way and overwhelmingly have a shared background wealthy privileged we end up with laws and policies that don't come close to addressing the realities of Americans lives
HLCL-2198|and since that's a basic requirement of government it's a pretty big thing to get wrong
HLCL-2199|in other words representation matters is representation everything of course not
HLCL-2200|just because I'm a woman it doesn't mean I'd be a good president for women
HLCL-2201|I would have been but not only because of my gender
HLCL-2202|but it does matter and often concrete ways I remember when I was pregnant
HLCL-2203|Chelsea working at the Rose law firm in Little Rock and repeatedly went to my superiors to ask about their maternity leave policy
HLCL-2204|did the question until there was no longer any way to avoid it then stammered that they didn't have a policy
HLCL-2205|no woman who's worked here as ever come back after having a baby
HLCL-2206|so I wrote my own I was a new partner and had the power to do that
HLCL-2207|but what about more Junior lawyers or support staff
HLCL-2208|would they have been expected to come in a few days after giving birth or not come back to work at all
HLCL-2209|it took a woman in the room to notice a huge hole in the firm's policies and care enough to fix it
HLCL-2210|representation matters and less visible but no less valuable ways to
HLCL-2211|I remember being riveted the little girl whenever a woman appeared in our history lessons Abigail Adams Sojourner Truth Ida Tarbell
HLCL-2212|Amelia Earhart even if it just amounted to a sentence in a Dusty book and often that's all they got is thrilled me
HLCL-2213|the great men in our history books but it meant something different something quietly momentous to learn that a woman had done something important
HLCL-2214|it opened the world it made me dream a little bigger
HLCL-2215|I remember coming home from school and opening Life Magazine to read about Margaret Chase Smith the gutsy Republican senator from Maine who stood up to Joe McCarthy
HLCL-2216|years later when I became first lady I wrote her a fan letter
HLCL-2217|as a young woman I was moved and inspired watching Barbara Jordan Speak Out eloquently for the rule of law on the house Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings Geraldine Ferraro stand onstage as the vice-presidential candidate for my party
HLCL-2218|Barbara mikulski shake up the US Senate
HLCL-2219|this time take on the NRA and Shirley Chisholm run for president
HLCL-2220|what hadenfeldt possible sublimate was
HLCL-2221|when Chelsea was a little girl I saw the power of representation through a new lens
HLCL-2222|I watched her leave through the pages ever children's books searching intently for the girl characters
HLCL-2223|now little girls have a new group of fictional heroines to look up to including Wonder Woman and general Leia she got a promotion from princess
HLCL-2224|slowly but surely Hollywood is moving in the right direction
HLCL-2225|that's why it meant so much to me to see all the little girls and young women at my campaign rallies and all the moms and dads pointing and saying look you see she's running for president you're smart like she is your tough like she is you can be president you can be anything you want to be
HLCL-2226|after the election I received a letter from a medical student named Kristen in Dearborn Michigan She Wrote
HLCL-2227|I saw you speak for the first time as a small girl
HLCL-2228|my mom took me and helped me to stand at offense and held me by the back of my overalls because I kept trying to wave to you and cheer you on
HLCL-2229|I was so ecstatic to hear such a smart woman speak and I've never looked back
HLCL-2230|you never let that version of Me Down
HLCL-2231|I read your history as I got older and then I got to see more speeches and read your writings you never let down the older versions of me either
HLCL-2232|even knowing how things turned out the memories of all those proud and excited girls and the thought of the women they will become means more to me than I can express
HLCL-2233|I know that there are some hearing this who will sneer representation it's so soft so wimpy so
HLCL-2234|if you can't imagine why it would matter for many of us to see a woman elected president and it wouldn't matter only two women just like the election of Barack Obama braces not just African Americans feel proud and inspired I simply urge you to accept that it matters too many of your fellow Americans even if it doesn't to you
HLCL-2235|I wish so badly that I've been able to take the oath of office and Achieve that milestone for women
HLCL-2236|still there were many feminists moments in this election we shouldn't forget
HLCL-2237|always remember Bill speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention
HLCL-2238|at one point he ordered the memorable words
HLCL-2239|on February 27th 1980 15 minutes after I got home from the governors Association conference in Washington Hillary's water broke
HLCL-2240|watching from our home in New York
HLCL-2241|that was the first time I've ever been sad about the Presidential nominee
HLCL-2242|I thought it was about time there's another moment I want to know that a lot of people missed when it happened but which I will never forget
HLCL-2243|a few days before election night 2016 Beyonce and Jay-Z performed at a rally for me in Cleveland
HLCL-2244|Beyonce took the microphone quote I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are Limitless she said
HLCL-2245|we have to think about the future of our daughters are sons and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do and that is why I'm with her unquote
HLCL-2246|and then that Infamous 1992 quote appeared in giant block letters on a huge screen behind her
HLCL-2247|I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had tea
HLCL-2248|but what I decided to do was pursue my profession
HLCL-2249|something that had been so controversial with being reclaimed as a message of Independence and strength
HLCL-2250|just like I had meant it to be all those years ago right before my eyes
HLCL-2251|thanks Beyonce will we ever have a woman President we will
HLCL-2252|I'll be around to vote for her assuming I agree with her agenda
HLCL-2253|based on her qualifications and ideas just like anyone else
HLCL-2254|when that day comes I believe that my two presidential campaigns will have helped pave the way for her
HLCL-2255|we did not win but we made the side of a woman nominee more familiar
HLCL-2256|we brought the possibility of a woman president closer
HLCL-2257|we helped bring into the mainstream the idea of a woman leader for our country that's a
HLCL-2258|deal and everyone who played a role in making that happen should feel deeply proud
HLCL-2259|this was worth it I will never think otherwise this fight was worth it
HLCL-2260|that's why I'm heartened that a wave of women across America have expressed willingness to run for office after this election not less
HLCL-2261|I'll admit I was worried that it would go the other way
HLCL-2262|and I will always do my part to encourage more women to run and to send a message to little girls teenagers and young women that their dreams and Ambitions are worth chasing
HLCL-2263|over the years I've hired and promoted a lot of young women
HLCL-2264|much of the time this is how it went
HLCL-2265|I'd like you to take on a bigger role young man I'm thrilled I'll do a great job I won't let you down
HLCL-2266|are you sure I'm ready I'm not sure
HLCL-2267|in a year these reactions aren't innate
HLCL-2268|men aren't naturally more confident than women
HLCL-2269|we tell them to believe in themselves and we tell women to doubt themselves
HLCL-2270|we tell them this in a million ways starting when they're young
HLCL-2271|who he's got to do better every single one of us
HLCL-2272|what would happen if we tell the truth about her life
HLCL-2273|the world would split open Muriel rukeyser
HLCL-2274|motherhood wife could daughterhood Sisterhood
HLCL-2275|I don't know what it's like four other women but growing up I didn't think that much about my gender except when it was front and center
HLCL-2276|like an eighth grade when I wrote to NASA to say that I dreamt of becoming an astronaut
HLCL-2277|and someone there wrote back sorry little girl we don't accept women into the space program
HLCL-2278|are window beat me in a student government race in high school told me I was really stupid if I thought a girl could be elected president of the school
HLCL-2279|or when I heard from Wellesley College I was in
HLCL-2280|these occasions I felt my gender powerfully
HLCL-2281|but most of the time I was just a kid a student a reader a fan a friend
HLCL-2282|the fact that I was female with secondary sometimes it practically slept my mind
HLCL-2283|other women may have had different experiences but that's how it was for me
HLCL-2284|my parents made that possible they treated my brothers Hugh and Tony and me like three individual kids with three individual personalities instead of putting me in a box marked female and them in a box marked mail
HLCL-2285|they never admit honest me for not acting like a girl when I played baseball with the boys they stress the importance of Education because they didn't want their daughter to feel constrained by tired ideas of what women should do with our lives
HLCL-2286|they wanted more for me than that later in life I started to see myself differently when I took on roles that fell deeply and powerfully womanly
HLCL-2287|wife daughter to aging parents girlfriend and most of all mother and grandmother
HLCL-2288|these identities transformed me yet somehow also felt like the truest expressions of myself
HLCL-2289|they felt both like pulling on a new garment and shedding my skin
HLCL-2290|I don't talk a lot about these pieces of my life they feel private they are private
HLCL-2291|but they're also Universal experiences and I believe in the value of women sharing our stories with one
HLCL-2292|it's how we support each other through our private struggles and how we find the strength to build the best possible lives for ourselves
HLCL-2293|these roles haven't been easy or painless
HLCL-2294|sometimes they've been very painful indeed
HLCL-2295|but they have been worth it my goodness have they been worth it
HLCL-2296|years rolled on again and Wendy had a daughter
HLCL-2297|this ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash
HLCL-2298|J M Barrie of the Democratic National Convention in July my daughter introduced me to the nation
HLCL-2299|I was backstage ready to walk onstage the instant she was done
HLCL-2300|at least I was supposed to be ready but I couldn't pull myself away from the television where her face fill the screen
HLCL-2301|hearing her talk I was sick grateful for waterproof mascara
HLCL-2302|the fact that my toys beautiful daughter was also standing up there as Charlotte's and Aiden's mother she'd given birth to her son only five weeks earlier made this even more special
HLCL-2303|during a burst of Applause you're the end of her remarks Jim Margolis was keeping his eye in the clock yelled to me we've got to go but Chelsea wasn't done and I didn't want to miss any of it
HLCL-2304|finally Jim yelled now we've really got to go
HLCL-2305|I snapped to attention and we raced down the hall and up the stairs in the dark
HLCL-2306|I stepped out on stage in the nick of time
HLCL-2307|from the moment she was born Chelsea has captivated me
HLCL-2308|I suspect a lot of parents know what I mean my child has me hooked
HLCL-2309|that night was no different she looked so happy recounting stories of growing up
HLCL-2310|it's always interesting to me to hear her perspective of her childhood
HLCL-2311|you try so many things as a parent I remember how hours after she was born Bill walked around the hospital room with tiny Chelsea in his arms explaining everything to her we didn't want to waste a moment
HLCL-2312|here's what Chelsea talked about at the DNC
HLCL-2313|our weekly trips to the library and church lazy afternoons outside line on the grass and spotting shapes in the clouds playing a game of her invention which dinosaur is the friendliest
HLCL-2314|she says I warned her not to be fooled that even seemingly friendly dinosaurs were still dinosaurs that sounds like me wasting no opportunity to impart some practical advice even an absurd circumstances
HLCL-2315|she talked about her favorite books that we read to her and though she later read by herself and told us all about like the science fantasy a ring
HLCL-2316|in time mostly Chelsea talked about me always being there and how she always knew how much we loved and valued her
HLCL-2317|I cannot express the happiness it brings to hear my daughter say that
HLCL-2318|this was my number one priority everyday of her childhood
HLCL-2319|making sure she knew that nothing was more important than her
HLCL-2320|I worried about this because Bill and I were extremely busy people
HLCL-2321|we worked long hours we travelled frequently in the phone in our house rang constantly often with urgent news
HLCL-2322|it wouldn't be unexpected for a little girl growing up surrounded by all that to feel overlooked
HLCL-2323|over the years I've met politicians kids who say I was pretty lonely I had to compete with the whole world for my parents attention
HLCL-2324|that was the worry that kept me up at night when Chelsea was young I couldn't bear the thought
HLCL-2325|one way we handled that was by not excluding her from our work week
HLCL-2326|issues and politics with her starting from a young age
HLCL-2327|in Her speech at the Democratic National Convention she described how hard it was to see me lose the fight for healthcare reform in 1994 when she was 14
HLCL-2328|she was there to comfort me and help provide diversions Watching Pride and Prejudice together
HLCL-2329|for me becoming a mother was the Fulfillment of a long-held dream
HLCL-2330|I love children love just sitting with them and being silly love bringing smiles to their sweet faces if you're ever looking for me at a party you're likely to find me wherever the kids are
HLCL-2331|before I even met my husband and thought about starting a family I was a lawyer and advocate for children
HLCL-2332|when Bill and I learned that we were going to be parents we were ecstatic we jumped around our kitchen like we were kids ourselves
HLCL-2333|getting pregnant was not easy for me but pregnancy itself was blessedly uneventful
HLCL-2334|Chelsea arrived three weeks early I was drugged and taken more than ready to meet my little one
HLCL-2335|neither build a bit whether the baby was a boy or girl
HLCL-2336|but when the doctor said it's a girl I felt so happy it was like a Sunburst beaming out of my chest a girl
HLCL-2337|I hadn't realized how much I wanted a daughter until she arrived she was a wish so secret I didn't even know that I had wished it
HLCL-2338|then she was here and I knew she was what I always wanted
HLCL-2339|if we had a son I'm sure I would have been just as over the moon
HLCL-2340|I would have realized it once that I had always wanted a sweet little boy to raise into a strong and caring man
HLCL-2341|but that's not what happened we had a daughter and not just any daughter but someone who brought such joy and love into our lives it felt like fate it was a greatest thing that ever happened to me by a mile
HLCL-2342|there's just something about daughters from the very beginning I felt a rush of wisdom that I wanted to impart to her about Womanhood how to be brave how to build real confidence and fake it when you have to how to respect yourself without taking yourself too seriously How To Love Yourself or at least try to and never stop trying to love others generously and courageously how to be strong but gentle
HLCL-2343|how to decide whose opinion to value and whose to disregard quietly how to believe in yourself even when others don't
HLCL-2344|some of these lessons were hard-won for me
HLCL-2345|I wanted badly to save my daughter the trouble maybe Chelsea could skip all that and arrive more quickly at a place of self-assurance
HLCL-2346|my desire to be the best mother in the world didn't translate into knowledge about how to do it
HLCL-2347|at first I was pretty inept in those early days she wouldn't stop crying I was nearly frantic
HLCL-2348|finally I sat down and tried my best to make eye contact with this squirming infant
HLCL-2349|Chelsea I said firmly this is new for both of us never been a mother before you've never been a baby we're just going to have to help each other do the best we can
HLCL-2350|those weren't magic words that stopped her wailing but they helped if for no other reason than that they reminded me I was completely new at this and should be gentle with myself
HLCL-2351|over the years I've met so many frazzle new mothers who can't figure out how to soothe their babies or get them to nurse or sleep
HLCL-2352|and I see in their eyes that same discombobulation I felt in those early days of Chelsea's life
HLCL-2353|it reminds me all over again how having a newborn is like every switch in your body being flicked on simultaneously
HLCL-2354|your brain becomes a one-track mind is a baby okay is the baby hungry is the baby sleeping is the baby breathing playing on an endless
HLCL-2355|if you're a new mother reading this sleep deprived and semi-coherent maybe wearing a tattered sweatshirt and dreaming of your next shower please know that so many of us have been right where you are
HLCL-2356|you're doing great it'll get easier so just hang in there and maybe ask your partner or Mom or friend to take over for a few hours so you can have that shower and get some sleep
HLCL-2357|Chelsea was born in 1980 a time when opportunities for women were greater than ever before in human history
HLCL-2358|she wouldn't say some of the closed doors I had
HLCL-2359|bill and I were determined that our daughter was never going to hear girls can't do that not if we can help it
HLCL-2360|when I couldn't holding this tiny baby in my arms is how much she would teach me about courage confidence and Grace
HLCL-2361|Chelsea has an inner strength that amazes me she is smart thoughtful observant and even under stress or attack
HLCL-2362|conducts herself with poise and self-possession
HLCL-2363|she is gifted at friendship always eager to meet new people but also comfortable with solitude
HLCL-2364|she trusts her mind and feeds it constantly she stands up for what she believes she is one of the toughest people I know but her toughness is quiet and deliberate easy to underestimate
HLCL-2365|that makes her even more formidable her smile is full of real Joy
HLCL-2366|I'm sure but Chelsea has been Chelsea from the very start
HLCL-2367|I think most parents find that their children are more formed when they arrive than we expect
HLCL-2368|it's like Kahlil Gibran wrote In The Prophet your children are not your children they come through you but not from you
HLCL-2369|you may give them your love but not your thoughts for they have their own thoughts you may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you
HLCL-2370|for life goes not backward Norterra with yesterday
HLCL-2371|like all moms I wanted to protect Chelsea from illness and injury bullies disappointments and a dangerous world
HLCL-2372|I also had a different set of threats in mind which are particular to the daughters of public figures
HLCL-2373|she grew up on the front page of newspapers she was attacked by right-wing personalities on the radio in mactan television when she was just 13 years old it still makes my blood boil
HLCL-2374|there were plenty of nights when I wondered if we had made a terrible mistake by subjecting her to this life
HLCL-2375|I worried not just that she feels self-conscious but also that she'd become too practiced in the art of putting on a happy face for the cameras
HLCL-2376|I wanted her to have a rich interior life to be sincere and spontaneous to own her feelings not stifle them
HLCL-2377|in short I wanted her to be a real per
HLCL-2378|send with her own identity and interest the only way I knew how to do that was to make her life as normal as possible
HLCL-2379|Chelsea had chores at the White House if she wanted a new book game she had to save her allowance to buy it
HLCL-2380|when she was bratty to accredit an extremely rare occurrence she was chastised and sometimes punished
HLCL-2381|our go-to with no TV or phone privileges for a week
HLCL-2382|but there's a limit to how much you can make life normal for the president's daughter so we also decided to embrace and celebrate the incredible opportunities that her unusual childhood and Adolescence offered
HLCL-2383|she visits overseas with us touring the forbidden city in China riding an elephant in Nepal having conversations with Nelson Mandela
HLCL-2384|she even found herself at 14 discussing One Hundred Years of Solitude with Gabriel Garcia Marquez
HLCL-2385|since you're always been interested in science and health bill made a point of introducing her to just about every scientist and Doctor Who visited the White House
HLCL-2386|she relished these conversations and experiences
HLCL-2387|this is so cool she said the first time we saw Camp David on her first flight on Air Force One when she came along as I led the US delegation to the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway
HLCL-2388|I watched her the questions she asked her excited Reflections and everything we saw and experienced and was delighted
HLCL-2389|she never grew bored or acted entitled she knew how special it all was
HLCL-2390|perhaps most important to me Chelsea never needed to be reminded to thank everyone who made our lives both extraordinary and ordinary
HLCL-2391|the White House staff her teachers her Secret Service detail her friends parents
HLCL-2392|she treated them all the exact same way even heads of state
HLCL-2393|her gratitude for the people in her life randeep
HLCL-2394|it led to many proud mom moments for me as the kids would say
HLCL-2395|over the years I worried about Chelsea less and less as it became clear I didn't have to
HLCL-2396|I also learn from her more and more
HLCL-2397|and stressful moments she's the calmest person in the room she also sees his every chance to be silly with her friends and now her kids
HLCL-2398|these are the actions of someone who understands that life will throw a lot of challenges your way and you should build up your inner resources of peace and happiness whenever you can
HLCL-2399|and as was particularly evident in the 2016 campaign she's Intrepid
HLCL-2400|Chelsea traveled far and wide campaigning for me and she did it with Aiden who she was still nursing
HLCL-2401|it's like that line from the late and Richards the governor of Texas Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did just backward heels
HLCL-2402|Chelsea did everything and energetic campaign surrogate would do just with a tiny baby attached to her and all the gear that he required
HLCL-2403|she called me from the road to tell me everything that she was seeing and hearing
HLCL-2404|I'm not sure we're breaking through she said both during the primary and the general
HLCL-2405|it feels really hard to get the facts out
HLCL-2406|her time on the 2016 campaign Trail started with a bang on her very first day when she politely raised questions about Bernie's healthcare plan she has a master's degree in public health and a doctorate in international relations with a focus on public health institutions so she knows what she's talking about she got absolutely
HLCL-2407|I remember our conversation on the phone that night
HLCL-2408|Chelsea was frustrated with herself that our words didn't match what she knew or felt I can empathize
HLCL-2409|she left some people with the impression that she thought Bernie wanted to get rid of all Healthcare
HLCL-2410|notion and of course not what you meant or said
HLCL-2411|she felt awful awful that she had left a false impression about anything with anyone and especially because it was related to something that she understands and cares about deeply
HLCL-2412|I wished I could give her a big hug instead we talked it out
HLCL-2413|our conversation might seem a little different from the average mother-daughter talk but underneath it's a lot like anyone's
HLCL-2414|we started in problem-solving mode
HLCL-2415|we reviewed the policy and how better to talk about the differences between Bernie's plan and mine
HLCL-2416|Chelsea have been right on the specifics that day at that stage in the campaign Bernie's Healthcare Plan called for starting over to get to single-payer which is what she said
HLCL-2417|but we both knew that wasn't going to matter at this point
HLCL-2418|we return to the basics why my plan to improve the Affordable Care Act and at a public option with the right one to get to you
HLCL-2419|reversal coverage as you can tell Chelsea and I are thought Partners on this topic in particular and her approach to thinking through problems and solutions is a lot like mine
HLCL-2420|we recently shared a smile and decide when we heard Bernie called for improving the Affordable Care Act immediately by embracing the approach that I proposed as a candidate a public option in 50 states and lowering the Medicare age to 55
HLCL-2421|we gave ourselves a few minutes to vent about all the time seemed visceral toward me our family and all women stepping out
HLCL-2422|then we switch gears and put the frustrating day behind us we laughed about a photo of Charlotte at ballet class that market sent us we talked about how glad we were that Chelsea passed she was a few months pregnant
HLCL-2423|and we said our I love yous and hung up knowing that tomorrow would be another opportunity to make our case and grateful that we
HLCL-2424|at each other's backs everyday I was humbled by her fear support of me
HLCL-2425|as a candidate I was glad to have her in my corner working diligently to explain important issues and what she believed so deeply in my plans and me
HLCL-2426|and as her mom I was and I'm so proud that she continues to rise above the attacks hurled at her every single day
HLCL-2427|more than anyone else it was Chelsea you helped me see that my stance on same-sex marriage was incompatible with my values and the work I have done in the Senate and at the state department to protect the rights of LGBT people
HLCL-2428|she impressed upon me that I had to endorse marriage equality if I was truly committed to equal human dignity and as soon as I left the state department I did
HLCL-2429|later when I received the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign I thought of her
HLCL-2430|and it was Chelsea you told me about the zika virus long before it was in the newspapers
HLCL-2431|this is going to be a huge problem she said and she was right we're still not doing enough
HLCL-2432|when Charlotte was born I felt the joy that comes with seeing your child take the great reservoir of love she has and enlarge it to include her own children along with a true partner of her own
HLCL-2433|Mark is a great dad and together they're fantastic parents
HLCL-2434|sometimes Chelsea and I do a dance that I expect is familiar to a lot of new moms and grandmothers out there
HLCL-2435|I'll go put the baby down for a nap or feed the toddler a snack and Chelsea will swoop in Mom that's not the way I do that
HLCL-2436|she can recite the latest American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on sleep infant feeding and screen time and I get to enjoy the special pleasure that comes from being a grandparent and knowing you don't have to worry about the baby because your child is handling the worrying
HLCL-2437|you can just focus on being the most loving and helpful grandparent you can be
HLCL-2438|Chelsea has been by my side every difficult moment since she arrived on this planet and I've leaned on her more than I ever thought I would
HLCL-2439|lay down election night when it was clear I had lost she was sitting next to me looking at me with a face full of love sending all her considerable strength and Grace toward me as hard as she could
HLCL-2440|as always she helped see me through the darkness
HLCL-2441|I was confident that bill would be great at parenting
HLCL-2442|his father died before bill was born he knew how lucky he was to have this chance that his own father never had
HLCL-2443|still a lot of men are thrilled to be dad's but not so thrilled about all the work that a child requires
HLCL-2444|the writer Kathy Pollard has observed how even the most egalitarian relationships can contort under the strain of child-rearing and all of a sudden the mom is a
HLCL-2445|back to do everything while the dad pictures in here and there
HLCL-2446|she calls it becoming gender Republicans a Nifty phrase if perhaps a little unfair to all the feminist Republicans out there who really do exist
HLCL-2447|I knew that I had energy and devotion 42 if it turned out that bill wasn't a co-equal in the child-raising department but I really hoped that wouldn't happen
HLCL-2448|our marriage had always been a true partnership so he was governor and then president jobs it would seem to be a lot of others if you were the kind of person who acts like that my career was important to me to sew with my time and more broadly my identity
HLCL-2449|I couldn't wait to become a mother but I didn't want to lose everything else about myself in the becoming
HLCL-2450|I was counting on my husband not just to respect that but also to join me and guarding against it
HLCL-2451|was a wonderful thing when Chelsea arrived
HLCL-2452|hunting with characteristic Gusto we arrived at the hospital with Bill clutching the materials from the Lamaze classes we had attended together
HLCL-2453|when it turned out that Chelsea was Bri Chief ought to be in the operating room with me and hold my hand during the C-section
HLCL-2454|Governor came in handy when he has to be the first father ever permitted by that hospital to do so
HLCL-2455|after we brought her home he handled countless midnight feedings and diaper changes we took turns making sure the parade of family and friends who wanted to spend time with Chelsea were looked after
HLCL-2456|as our daughter grew up we both read her goodnight stories we both got to know her teachers and coaches
HLCL-2457|even when Bill became president he rearrange his schedule as much as he could to have dinner with us nearly every night that he was in Washington
HLCL-2458|and when he was somewhere else in the world he'd call Chelsea to talk about her day and go over her homework with her
HLCL-2459|every year our daughter adores her father more and more
HLCL-2460|as she entered adolescence I wondered if that would change it all
HLCL-2461|I remembered how my own somewhat distant from each other once I became a teenager
HLCL-2462|I provoked him with a lot of fiery political arguments
HLCL-2463|he was at a loss to navigate the occasionally stormy seas of teenage girl hoodie
HLCL-2464|would that happen with Chelsea and Bill as it turned out know he lived for their debates the fiercer the better
HLCL-2465|you didn't leave me to deal with the girl stuff heartache self-esteem safety he was right there with us
HLCL-2466|did I handle more of the family responsibilities especially while bill was president of course he was President this was something we talked through before he ran and I was more than up for it
HLCL-2467|but I never felt like I was alone in the work of raising our wonderful daughter
HLCL-2468|it's a busy man who would say otherwise
HLCL-2469|to be a great president but that wouldn't have mattered to him if he wasn't also a great dad
HLCL-2470|everytime I see my husband and daughter laugh over some private joke that only they know every time I overhear a conversation between them two lightning-quick mines testing each other every time I see him look at her with total love and devotion
HLCL-2471|I'm reminded again that I chose exactly the right person to have a family with
HLCL-2472|I don't want to be married just to be married I can't think of anything lonelier than spending the rest of my life with someone I can't talk to or Worse someone I can't be silent with
HLCL-2473|Mary Ann Schaefer my marriage to Bill Clinton was the most consequential decision of my life
HLCL-2474|I said no the first two times he asked me but the third time I said yes
HLCL-2475|and I do it again I hesitated to say yes because I wasn't quite prepared for marriage I hadn't figured out what I wanted my future to be yet
HLCL-2476|and I knew that by marrying bill I would be running straight into a future far more momentous than any other I'd likely
HLCL-2477|he was the most intense brilliant charismatic person I've ever met
HLCL-2478|he dreamt big and was practical and cautious
HLCL-2479|I knew that marrying him would be like hitching a ride on a comet
HLCL-2480|it took me a little while to get brave enough to take the leap
HLCL-2481|we've been married since 1975 we've had many many more happy days than sad or angry
HLCL-2482|we met in the library at Yale law school one evening and started chatting and all these years later that conversation is still going strong
HLCL-2483|there's no one I want to talk to more than him
HLCL-2484|I know some people wonder why we're still together
HLCL-2485|I heard it again in the 2016 campaign that we must have an arrangement
HLCL-2486|we do it's called a marriage that I helped him become president and then stayed so he could help me become president
HLCL-2487|that we lead completely separate lives and it's just a marriage on paper now
HLCL-2488|he is reading this over my shoulder in our kitchen with our dogs underfoot and in a minute he will reorganize our bookshelves for the millionth time which means I will not be able to find any of my books and once I learn the new system he'll just redo it again but I don't mind because he really loves to organize those bookshelves
HLCL-2489|I don't believe our marriage is anyone's business
HLCL-2490|public people should be allowed to have private lives to
HLCL-2491|but I know that a lot of people are genuinely interested
HLCL-2492|maybe you're flat-out perplexed
HLCL-2493|maybe you want to know how this works because you are married would like it to last 40 years or longer and you're looking for perspective
HLCL-2494|I certainly can't fault you on that I don't want to delve into all the details because I really do want to hold on to What's Left of my privacy as much as I can
HLCL-2495|but I will say this has been an extraordinary father to our beloved daughter and exuberant Hands-On grandfather to our two grandchildren
HLCL-2496|I look at Chelsea and Charlotte and Aiden and I think we did this that's a big deal
HLCL-2497|he has been my partner in life and my greatest champion since the moment we met
HLCL-2498|he never once asked me to put my career on hold for his
HLCL-2499|you never once suggested that maybe I shouldn't compete for anything in work or politics because it would interfere with his
HLCL-2500|or Ambitions there were stretches of time in which my husband's job was unquestionably more important than mine and he still didn't play that card
HLCL-2501|I have never felt like anything but an equal
HLCL-2502|his late mother Virginia deserves much of the credit she works hard as a nurse anaesthetist held strong opinions and had an unmatched zest for life
HLCL-2503|as a result still is completely unbothered by having an ambitious opinionated occasionally pushy wife
HLCL-2504|in fact he loves me for it long before I thought of running for public office he was saying you should do it you'd be great at it I'd love to vote for you
HLCL-2505|he helped me believe in this bigger version of myself
HLCL-2506|what's a devoted son-in-law and always made my parents feel welcome in our home
HLCL-2507|toward the end of my mother's life when I wanted her to move into our house in Washington he said yes without has
HLCL-2508|patient do I expected nothing less this meant the world to me
HLCL-2509|I know so many women who are married to men who do they have their good qualities can be solid Moody irritated at small request and generally disappointed with everyone and everything
HLCL-2510|Bill Clinton is the opposite he has a temper but he's never mean any funny friendly unflappable in the face of mishaps and inconveniences and easily delighted by the world
HLCL-2511|remember those balloons at the convention he is fabulous company
HLCL-2512|we certainly had dark days in our marriage you know all about them and please consider for a moment what it would be like for the whole world to know about the worst moments in your relationship
HLCL-2513|there were times that I was deeply unsure about whether our marriage could or should survive
HLCL-2514|but on those days I ask myself the questions that matter most to me
HLCL-2515|do I still love and can I still be in this marriage without becoming unrecognizable to myself Twisted by anger resentment or remoteness
HLCL-2516|the answers were always yes so I kept going
HLCL-2517|our first date we went to the Yale University Art Gallery to see a mark rothko exhibit
HLCL-2518|the building was closed but Bill talked our way in
HLCL-2519|we had the building entirely to ourselves
HLCL-2520|when I think about that afternoon seeing the art hearing the Stillness all around us giddy about this person who might have just met but somehow knew would change my life
HLCL-2521|it still feels magical and I feel happy and lucky all over again
HLCL-2522|I still think he's one of the most handsome men I've ever known I'm proud of him proud of his vast intellect his big heart the contributions he has made to the world
HLCL-2523|I love him with my whole heart that's more than enough to build
HLCL-2524|I looked up at the Blue Sky feeling in fact a burst of energy but mostly feeling my mother's presents remembering why it was that I'd thought I could hike this Trail
HLCL-2525|Cheryl Strayed I met a lot of strong people in my life but no one stronger than my mother
HLCL-2526|people say that about their mothers all the time but consider the life of Dorothy Howell
HLCL-2527|starting when she was three or four her parents would leave her alone all day and their fifth-floor walk-up in Chicago
HLCL-2528|when she got hungry she had to bundle yourself up walk down all those stairs go to a nearby restaurant produce a meal voucher eat and then walk all the way home alone
HLCL-2529|at age 8 she was put on a train headed to California
HLCL-2530|her parents were getting divorced so they sent her and her three-year-old sister to live with their paternal grandparents
HLCL-2531|the little girls made the journey by themselves no adults it took 4 days
HLCL-2532|her grandmother wore long black tutorial dresses her grandfather hardly said a word
HLCL-2533|their rules were incredibly strict when my mother dared to go trick-or-treating when Halloween the punishment was confinement to her bedroom for a full year coming out only to go to school
HLCL-2534|by the time she was 14 my mother couldn't take it anymore she found a job as a housekeeper for a local family she looked after the children in exchange for a place to live
HLCL-2535|house and skirt that she washed every night
HLCL-2536|but the family was kind to her finally a little kindness
HLCL-2537|encouraged her to keep going to high school
HLCL-2538|when Mom educated from high school she moved back to Chicago because her mother sent her a letter suggesting that maybe they could be a family again
HLCL-2539|despite everything she missed her mom and wanted badly to be reunited
HLCL-2540|but when she got there her mother made it clear that what she really wanted was a housekeeper
HLCL-2541|something broke in my mom's heart forever
HLCL-2542|still she was a good daughter and we dutifully visited my grandmother a few times a year
HLCL-2543|small apartment found an office job and met my dad hear autumn
HLCL-2544|they married in 1942 and after WWII had me followed by my two brothers
HLCL-2545|we lived in a house in the suburbs mom a homemaker with a blur of constant energy cooking cleaning hanging laundry doing dishes helping us with our homework and sewing clothes for me
HLCL-2546|when I was in high school she made me a dress with a print of red roses that I thought was the
HLCL-2547|I never seen she loved us intensely and worked hard to make our childhoods meaningful and fun
HLCL-2548|we played a lot of games read lots of books went and talked about everything under the sun
HLCL-2549|back in the day kids and their parents didn't consider each other friends that's not how it worked they were the parents we were the kids
HLCL-2550|but when I look back there was no question that she was my best friend
HLCL-2551|even as a little girl I saw how strong she was she was so confident
HLCL-2552|when Mom said something you knew that she meant it when she told me to stand up for myself with a neighborhood bully I did she was so determined that some of her determination rubbed off on me
HLCL-2553|she was not a huge personality she didn't pound her fist on the table or yell like my dad did that's not how she made her presence known
HLCL-2554|but she knew what she believed she lived her values she would do anything for us and we would do anything for her
HLCL-2555|all of that made her powerful when I got older the full extent of her Loveless lonely childhood hit me
HLCL-2556|I wondered if I could have survived such an ordeal with my spirit and dignity intact
HLCL-2557|she knew that she was worthy of love and decent treatment even though the world told her otherwise for a long time
HLCL-2558|how did she hold onto that self-respect in the face of all that disregard
HLCL-2559|the most important people in our life told her she was nothing
HLCL-2560|how did she know that wasn't true I marveled at the mental strength that must have taken to keep believing that a better day was coming that she would find her place that hard work would see her through
HLCL-2561|that her life had meaning despite how unfair fate had been to her
HLCL-2562|when I became a mother myself and discovered how much patience and resilience it requires I saw my mother's strength in a new way
HLCL-2563|she was raised with such neglect to the extent that she was raised at all
HLCL-2564|how did she learn how to give my brothers and me such a loving and secure childhood
HLCL-2565|we talked about this she said she carefully observed every family she ever met including that family she worked for the fourteen-year-old all those years ago
HLCL-2566|she paid attention to how the parents spoke to each other and to their kids
HLCL-2567|she saw that gentle firmness was possible and that families could actually laugh together and not just sit in Stony silence
HLCL-2568|mostly she figured it out in her own it wasn't hard for her she said she loved us and was so happy to be around us it was easy to show it
HLCL-2569|but I know other people whose parents had cruel childhoods and who internalize that cruelty and dished it out to their own kids later
HLCL-2570|that's how abuse gets passed on to the generations
HLCL-2571|that's probably what happened with my grandmother and fact
HLCL-2572|my mom single-handedly stopped at cycle dead in its tracks
HLCL-2573|in my experience as people get older they start looking after their parents or their parents keep looking after them
HLCL-2574|my parents kept looking after me when they visited they fussed over me did I need a sweater was I hungry I'm generally the one who looks after everyone else so it was very sweet and rather amusing to have the roles reversed
HLCL-2575|we were closed after Bill became governor of Arkansas in 1979 my parents moved to Little Rock
HLCL-2576|dad was retired and they were ready for a new chapter to unfold preferably as near to their beloved baby granddaughter as possible
HLCL-2577|dad died just a few months after Bill became president
HLCL-2578|I begged mom to come live with us in the White House
HLCL-2579|but it wasn't surprising that she said no thank you
HLCL-2580|she was too independent for that she did come visit us for weeks at a time staying in a bedroom on the third floor
HLCL-2581|she even traveled a few times with Bill Chelsea and me on foreign trips
HLCL-2582|after I became a senator and we left the White House move close by to an apartment building in Northwest Washington DC
HLCL-2583|she loved walking around town going to museums and the zoo there free in Washington having dinner with Bill and me a few nights a week and seeing a lot of my brother Tony who lives in Virginia just outside Washington with his wife Megan and my nephew's Zach and Simon and nice Fiona
HLCL-2584|a few years later I asked again and she finally agreed to come live with Bill and Mae because it was getting too hard for her to live on her own
HLCL-2585|mom had some heart problems which meant that unpacking groceries or folding laundry could leave her Breathless
HLCL-2586|she who was always in ceaseless motion now move gingerly and she worried about injuring herself
HLCL-2587|I was glad that Mom agreed to live with us without my having to fight her on it but I was ready to fight her on it
HLCL-2588|Independence was important but so were her health and safety
HLCL-2589|when she still lived alone there were times I'd be at work in the Senate and realize that I hadn't heard from her all day and panic a little
HLCL-2590|has she Fallen what she okay at our house there were always people around if Mom moved in we wouldn't have to worry as much anymore
HLCL-2591|except it wasn't as easy as that
HLCL-2592|we discovered something many parents and children find out late in life
HLCL-2593|did the balance between them is different once the child is grown in the parent is aging
HLCL-2594|mom didn't want to be mothered she still wanted to mother
HLCL-2595|I didn't want to encroach on our independence and dignity the thought horrified me but I also wanted to be straightforward with her about what I thought she could and couldn't do it
HLCL-2596|no more walking down the basement steps alone they were too steep she would fall that any restriction and largely ignored my suggestions just as stubborn as she was
HLCL-2597|there was one major fact that kept the balance steady between us I still needed my mother
HLCL-2598|I needed her shoulder to lean on I needed her wisdom and advice
HLCL-2599|I used to come home from a long day in the senate or in 2007 and 2008 from a day on the campaign Trail and slide in next to her at our kitchen table and let all my frustrations and worries Tumblr
HLCL-2600|mostly she just listened when she gave advice it always came down to the same basic idea you know the right thing to do do what's right
HLCL-2601|mom lived with us for five years and I treasured everyday the whole
HLCL-2602|and we did our home was a busy place thanks to her
HLCL-2603|grandson Zac came by after school to see her all the time Tony and Megan Brasi on and Simon over frequently or took Mom back to their home for the weekend she relished her time with them
HLCL-2604|she talked to my brother who lived in Florida every single day sandwich Chelsea not a day went by without a phone call and every week Chelsea and Mark came to see her
HLCL-2605|she Enchanted all our friends several of Chelsea's male friends adopted mom is their mother and was stopped in to check on her and stay for dinner debate or The Sopranos
HLCL-2606|she was good company quick-witted and well-read
HLCL-2607|the day she died at 92 she was halfway through the Mind's Eye by Oliver Sacks
HLCL-2608|we were so lucky to have her with us for so long
HLCL-2609|many of my friends have lost their mothers by then
HLCL-2610|she was mine greeting me every morning and night with a sweet smile and a pat on the hand
HLCL-2611|I never miss a chance to tell her that I loved her
HLCL-2612|the choice to put aside my briefing books for an hour or two so we could watch something on TV she adored Dancing with the Stars or have a late dinner together
HLCL-2613|briefing books could wait this time with Mom was precious
HLCL-2614|I would have given anything to have that kind of time with my dad I wasn't going to let this opportunity Pass Me By
HLCL-2615|I was grateful for her long full life grateful for every moment we shared grateful that I have the means to care for her the way I did and grateful for the deep love she shared with Chelsea and the wise advice she gave her
HLCL-2616|I can't count the number of people across the country I've met who would love nothing more than to have their aging parents living comfortably at home with them but they can't afford it or they don't
HLCL-2617|the room we had the room we could afford it I feel extraordinary lucky for that
HLCL-2618|we didn't leave anything on said between us I feel lucky for that too
HLCL-2619|after mom died even though I was Secretary of State I felt just like a little girl again missing my mother
HLCL-2620|isn't it funny how that happens a British publication once offered a prize for the best definition of a friend among the thousands of answers received were
HLCL-2621|1 * divides grief and whose honesty is inviolable
HLCL-2622|and one who understands our silence
HLCL-2623|the winning definition a friend is the one who comes in when the whole world has gone out
HLCL-2624|bits and pieces magazine every
HLCL-2625|one of these experiences the joys and struggles of marriage motherhood and daughter Hood I have shared with my friends
HLCL-2626|my friends are everything to me some have been by my side since I was 5 I'm still friends with her the first day
HLCL-2627|they seen me at my worst and I've seen them at there's we've been through it all divorces remarriages births of children deaths of parents and spouses
HLCL-2628|some of my closest friends have passed away and I miss them every single day which makes me value the friends who are still with me even more
HLCL-2629|we Saturday each other's Hospital bedsides we've danced at our children's weddings we've drunk good wine and good food gossiped and hides and read books together
HLCL-2630|we have ensured that an indivisible team
HLCL-2631|some of these friends are men and summer women
HLCL-2632|and I want to take a moment to celebrate my male friends
HLCL-2633|and my corner over the years come hell or high water
HLCL-2634|there are some out there who
HLCL-2635|I can't understand that I don't know what I do without the man who challenged me in Courage me hold me to account and make me laugh so hard I can't breathe
HLCL-2636|but my girlfriends my girlfriends are something else entirely
HLCL-2637|in my experience there's a special strength at the heart of friendships between women
HLCL-2638|we get real with each other we talked about raw and painful things
HLCL-2639|we admit to each other insecurities and fears that we sometimes don't admit even to ourselves
HLCL-2640|here's an example I loved motherhood passionately but there were days when it fell there's no other way to say this very very boring
HLCL-2641|I would read the same children's book 20 times in a row and feel myself become dollar
HLCL-2642|my colleagues were doing interesting challenging work and I was at home singing Itsy Bitsy Spider for the millionth time
HLCL-2643|I wondered if I was a monster for feeling this way so I asked my friends their verdict nope just a normal mom
HLCL-2644|when I struggle to get pregnant I talk to my girlfriend's when I talk to my girlfriend's when I lost the 2016 election I talked to my girlfriend's in a particularly open way about how it felt to fail
HLCL-2645|I have never hesitated to be honest with them even if what I had to say was gloomy or blunt
HLCL-2646|they know who I am deep inside so I'm never scared of losing their good opinion
HLCL-2647|there are a lot of people for whom I put on a happy face but not my friends
HLCL-2648|it's bewildering to me when female friendships are depicted in movies or on TV as caddy or undermining
HLCL-2649|I'm sure there are relationships like that
HLCL-2650|but in my experience they're not the norm friendships Between Women provide Solace and understanding in a world that can be really hard on us
HLCL-2651|the pressure to be a perfect wife mother and daughter can be unbearable
HLCL-2652|what a relief it is to find people you can share it all with and be reassured that you're doing just fine
HLCL-2653|if you're unconvinced that friends are worth it consider the data here is where my friends would say of course
HLCL-2654|studies show that when seniors interact on a regular basis with friends they have fewer problems with memory and depression greater physical mobility and are more likely to get regular checkups
HLCL-2655|now that I'm officially in the senior category I'm holding on even more tightly to my friends they're literally keeping me strong
HLCL-2656|making friends in adulthood can be hard for anybody
HLCL-2657|for billing me there are complications
HLCL-2658|do we let people into our Lives who we don't know very well
HLCL-2659|what if they just want to get to know us in order to have a good story to tell
HLCL-2660|we've been burned by people it's not fun to feel used
HLCL-2661|then there's the risk that people face when they become our friends
HLCL-2662|if you go out to dinner with me your picture might be in the paper
HLCL-2663|you might be hounded by trolls online you might lose friends who detest me because of my politics
HLCL-2664|you might even need to hire a lawyer I almost want to offer a disclaimer to new friends these side effects may occur
HLCL-2665|it's for reasons of well-known public figures don't really make new friends they close the circle it's understandable
HLCL-2666|and yet I try to keep making new friends just in the past year I've become close to a few new people including a mystery writer I've been reading
HLCL-2667|4 years who is now my pen pal for me it's worth the risk
HLCL-2668|I get so much for my friendships I learned so much I laughed so much and it feels really good to build my community to feel connected to an ever-larger web of people from different backgrounds and different chapters of my life
HLCL-2669|I don't want to spend time just with politicians
HLCL-2670|who in the world wants that I spent so much of my life in the public eye keeping a tight hold on what I say and how I react to things that it is such a relief to have friends with whom I can be vulnerable and unedited I don't just enjoy that I need it it keeps me sane
HLCL-2671|it comes down to this for me I don't want to live
HLCL-2672|live a big expensive one I think of the poet Mary Oliver has question about what each of us plans to do with our one wild precious life
HLCL-2673|to me that answer includes staying open to new friends carrying their stories and sharing mine intern
HLCL-2674|there's a special group of men over the years I want to mention other first ladies women senators and secretaries of State
HLCL-2675|I wouldn't say we're Intimates but we understand one another in a way few others do
HLCL-2676|we know what it's like to see our husbands attacked and our marriage is question relentlessly and have to explain that to our children
HLCL-2677|we know what it's like to be outnumbered a vastly male-dominated field and just a dignified and cheerful despite being patronized or talked over on a daily basis
HLCL-2678|it doesn't matter what political party we belong to we're connected in a deeper way
HLCL-2679|it reminds me of what Sandra Day O'Connor who for a long time was the only woman on the Supreme Court said when Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined her there
HLCL-2680|Justice Ginsburg came to the court we were nine justices it wasn't 7 and then the women we became 9 release to me
HLCL-2681|the women who have walked the path as I've walked have been a relief to me to
HLCL-2682|and I hope I've been the same to them I don't believe any of us gets through life alone finding meaning and happiness takes a village my friends have been my Village I wouldn't have it any other way
HLCL-2683|to console does not mean to take away the pain but rather to be there and say
HLCL-2684|You are not alone I am with you
HLCL-2685|together we can carry the burden don't be afraid I am here
HLCL-2686|what is consolation we all need to give it as well as to receive it
HLCL-2687|Henri nouwen turning mourning into a movement
HLCL-2688|they radiated strength they were proud women who had Cena W cried a lot and prayed a lot
HLCL-2689|I walked around the room introducing myself one-by-one to the Dozen mothers who had come from all over the country
HLCL-2690|I listened to their stories and took in their quiet Fierce dignity
HLCL-2691|it was November 2015 we were in the homies Sweet Maple Cafe on Chicago's West Side
HLCL-2692|each of the mothers around the table had lost children to gun violence or in encounters with police officers
HLCL-2693|they come to talk about what happened to their kids
HLCL-2694|and to see if I would do something about it or if I was just another politician after votes
HLCL-2695|later some of these mothers would form a traveling Sisterhood
HLCL-2696|the mother of the movement
HLCL-2697|they told their stories and churches and community centers and on stage at the Democratic National Convention
HLCL-2698|their courage their generosity of spirit
HLCL-2699|their refusal to give up all of it inspired and motivated me
HLCL-2700|thanks in part to the mother's example I ended up speaking frequently and forcefully throughout the campaign about gun violence racial Justice police reform and mass incarceration
HLCL-2701|these are complicated issues substantiv Lee and politically
HLCL-2702|but listening to the mother's stories and watching the steady drumbeat of mass shootings and deadly police incidents that continue throughout 2015 and 2016 convince me that they were too important to ignore
HLCL-2703|so I made Criminal Justice Reform a priority with my very first policy
HLCL-2704|stressing the need for communities to respect the police who protect them and for the police to respect the people they serve
HLCL-2705|I also criticized the powerful National Rifle Association for its extreme opposition to Common Sense gun safety measures
HLCL-2706|going after the NRA is dangerous for candidates
HLCL-2707|but I felt compelled to speak out on behalf of the dead and injured victims of gun homicides accidents and suicides
HLCL-2708|if I had one we could have made progress toward keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and domestic abusers and making sure fewer parents have to bury their children the way the mothers of the movement did
HLCL-2709|my profound disappointment that I couldn't deliver that outcome will never go away
HLCL-2710|the mother stories in the stories of others who lost loved ones to gun violence deserve to be told and heard
HLCL-2711|we've got to keep saying that their names
HLCL-2712|and that first meeting in Chicago there was no press and no audience just us
HLCL-2713|I was accompanied by my senior policy advisor Maya Harris and director of African-American Outreach ladavia drain
HLCL-2714|sybrina Fulton who's unarmed seventeen-year-old son Trayvon Martin was shot and killed outside a convenience store near Orlando Florida in 2012 kick things off
HLCL-2715|we're just regular moms she said we don't want to be Community activist we don't want to be the mothers of Senseless gun violence we don't want to be in this position we were forced into this position
HLCL-2716|none of us would have signed up for this Trayvon was killed while wearing a hooded sweatshirt and taking a walk to buy some Skittles candy at the corner store
HLCL-2717|Jordan Davis was shot in Jacksonville Florida
HLCL-2718|listening to music in a car that a white man thoughts was too loud and Tuesday
HLCL-2719|12 year old Tamir rice was playing in a Cleveland Park with a toy gun when he was shot by a police officer
HLCL-2720|Eric Garner was choked to death by an officer after selling loose cigarettes on a Staten Island Street
HLCL-2721|some of the stories were about criminal gun violence others excessive force by police officers
HLCL-2722|these issues require different policy Solutions and different political responses
HLCL-2723|with a common theme that ran through all the stories was race
HLCL-2724|and the anguish all these mothers felt was the same
HLCL-2725|anguish that no mother no parent should have to bury
HLCL-2726|Jordan's mother Lucia mcbath remembers comforting her son after they heard about trayvon's murder on the news
HLCL-2727|Jordan didn't know Trayvon they lived in different parts of Florida
HLCL-2728|the news hit him hard how did this happen to Trayvon he wasn't doing anything wrong he asked
HLCL-2729|Lucy I didn't have a good answer nine months later Jordan was dead as well
HLCL-2730|now trayvon's and Jordan's mom's we're sitting at the same table
HLCL-2731|we lay in bed and the ceiling and cry
HLCL-2732|she's a mother of Eric Garner we Replay in our heads over and over what happened to our children
HLCL-2733|hadiya Pendleton with a fifteen-year-old honor student when she was randomly shot in a Chicago Park
HLCL-2734|just a week before she had performed with her High School band at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington
HLCL-2735|there are no words for what we go through everyday just waking up her mother Cleo told me
HLCL-2736|I didn't have a voice after hydeia pass
HLCL-2737|for like 3 or 4 days the only thing I could do was open my eyes and scream literally at the top of my lungs
HLCL-2738|my throat tighten does I listen to the mothers tell these stories
HLCL-2739|watching them remained composed despite the shattering pain behind their words
HLCL-2740|Elizabeth Stone says it having a child is like deciding to have your heart go walking around outside your body
HLCL-2741|the thought of something happening to your kid is unimaginable to any parent
HLCL-2742|these mothers had lived that nightmare
HLCL-2743|they also faced different deeper fears that I never had to think about
HLCL-2744|my daughter and grandchildren are white they won't know what it's like to be watched with suspicion when they play in the park or enter a store
HLCL-2745|people won't lock their car doors when they walk by
HLCL-2746|police officers won't pull them over for driving in the wrong neighborhood
HLCL-2747|these aren't likely to settle their Feud on the streets where they walk to school
HLCL-2748|as people of color we feel the greatest impact of this Injustice of this inhumane treatment Gwen car said
HLCL-2749|some people say that we're racist because we say black lives matter
HLCL-2750|we know that all lives matter but we need people to understand that black lives matter also
HLCL-2751|so treat us as such don't just treat us like common animals were not where American citizens and we deserve fair treatment
HLCL-2752|treating everyone with care and respect is especially important for the men and women charged with keeping us all safe
HLCL-2753|I feel strongly about this the vast majority of police officers are honorable Brave public servants who put their lives on the line every day to protect others
HLCL-2754|as a senator I spent years fighting for First Responders who served at Ground Zero and later suffered lasting health effects
HLCL-2755|they paid a terrible price for serving the rest of us
HLCL-2756|I also have the unique experience of being guarded around the clock for more than 25 years by highly trained men and women committed to take a bullet for me if a threat ever came
HLCL-2757|if that doesn't teach you to respect the courage and professionalism of law enforcement nothing will
HLCL-2758|the officers have been proud of their integrity disgusted by the use of excessive force and eager to find new and better ways to do their jobs
HLCL-2759|every time a police officer falls in the line of duty something that happens with sickening frequency it's a reminder of how much we owe them and their families
HLCL-2760|throughout the campaign I had many meetings and discussions with law enforcement
HLCL-2761|secure their views about what we could do better
HLCL-2762|in August 2016 I met with a group of retired and current police Chiefs from across the country including Bill Bratton from New York Charlie back from Los Angeles and Chuck Ramsey from Philadelphia
HLCL-2763|they stressed the importance of building relationships between their officers and the communities they serve
HLCL-2764|he also stressed that part of what we owe our officers is honesty and a willingness to confront hard truth
HLCL-2765|1 hard truth we all have to face is that we all have implicit biases
HLCL-2766|I have them you have them and police officers have them deeply ingrained thoughts that can lead us to think gun when a black man reaches for his wallet
HLCL-2767|acknowledging this during the campaign may have cost me the support of some police officers and organizations
HLCL-2768|who seemed to thank my concern for dead children and other victims showed a presumption of wrongdoing by police
HLCL-2769|that's Tong but I was grateful for the support of other law enforcement officers who wanted to rebuild bonds of trust that would make them and all of us safer and who thought I was the best candidate to make that happen
HLCL-2770|Dallas Sheriff Lupe Valdez said at the Democratic National Convention we put on our badges everyday to Serve and Protect not to hate and discriminate
HLCL-2771|she and other officers believe as I do that we can work together to improve policing without women
HLCL-2772|as a candidate I worked with civil rights Advocates and law enforcement leaders to develop solutions that would help
HLCL-2773|from body cameras to new training guidelines for D escalating 10 situations
HLCL-2774|I also spoke often about the importance of trying harder to
HLCL-2775|in one another's shoes that means police officers and all of us doing everything we can to understand the effects of systemic racism that young black and Latino men and women face everyday and how they are made to feel like their lives are disposable
HLCL-2776|it also means imagining what it's like to be a police officer kissing his or her kids and spouse goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous but necessary job
HLCL-2777|this kind of empathy is hard to come by the divisions in our country Run Deep
HLCL-2778|as Maria Hamilton said to me it's been like that for 500 years Hillary people just haven't been talking about it
HLCL-2779|her on arm son Dante was killed in 2014 shot more than a dozen times by a police officer in Milwaukee after a scuffle in a public park. Falling asleep on a bench
HLCL-2780|her words were reminder that for these mothers and generations of black parents before them The Killing and mistreatment of young black men and women with tragic but not shocking
HLCL-2781|this has been the reality of life in America for a long time
HLCL-2782|but we can't accept it as our inevitable future
HLCL-2783|Maria's words pointed to the complex relationship between race and gun violence
HLCL-2784|it is not a coincidence that it is the leading cause of death for young black man outstripping the next nine causes of death combined
HLCL-2785|that is the result of Decades of policy choices neglect underinvestment gangs and Thugs and adversarial policing in communities of color
HLCL-2786|Steph said it's a mistake to think that gun violence is a problem just for black people or poor people or only in cities
HLCL-2787|gun violence touches every class color and Community with 33,000
HLCL-2788|7 people dying from Guns each year an average of 90 a day
HLCL-2789|that's a particularly devastating fact because gun violence is largely preventable
HLCL-2790|other developed Nations don't have this problem they have common sense laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people
HLCL-2791|those laws work they save lives
HLCL-2792|the United States has made a cruel Choice as a country not to take simple steps that would help prevent or at least lessen this epidemic
HLCL-2793|the mothers know this all too well consider the story of Annette Nancy Holt
HLCL-2794|she worked hard to rise through the ranks of the Chicago Fire Department becoming a battalion chief
HLCL-2795|she has her ex-husband Ron a Chicago Police Commander did everything they could to give their son Blair a safe comfortable middle-class life
HLCL-2796|they taught him to be generous and humble the field grateful for all we had
HLCL-2797|by the time he was 16 Blair was a kind hard-working music-loving high school student on the honor roll
HLCL-2798|he was planning to go to college to study business the first step to accomplishing his dream of being in the music industry
HLCL-2799|even though a net and Ron devoted their lives to keeping their City safe
HLCL-2800|in the end they couldn't protect their beloved child
HLCL-2801|one day in 2007 Lair was riding a public bus from school to his grandparents store where he sometimes helped out
HLCL-2802|a young gang member opened fire on a group of teenagers aiming for someone in a rival
HLCL-2803|a friend sitting next to Blair jumped up to run to the back of the bus but Blair pushed her back into the sea
HLCL-2804|he saved her life but was killed himself
HLCL-2805|all the mothers are on the table with me that day in Chicago had stories like that
HLCL-2806|and they each had decided to do whatever she could to protect other children from suffering the fate of Their Own
HLCL-2807|they were focused intensely on Curbing gun violence reforming policing and ensuring accountability for these deaths
HLCL-2808|sybrina Fulton founded the Trayvon Martin Foundation to support families and to advocate for gun safety reforms
HLCL-2809|Geneva Reed veal who's 28 year old daughter Sandra Bland died after being jailed for a minor traffic violation redoubled her community work through her church
HLCL-2810|all of the mothers were discovering that their stories and moral Authority could make them powerful public advocate's
HLCL-2811|as Cleo Pendleton put it when I found my voice I couldn't shut up
HLCL-2812|but progress was far too slow they were understandably frustrated by
HLCL-2813|how hard it was to even get a hearing from local authorities and the US justice department let alone action
HLCL-2814|too many of them had been brushed off or insulted and even attacked in the media
HLCL-2815|Sabrina and her ex-husband had to listen to their son's killer tell the Press they didn't raise their son right and later make a small fortune auctioning off the gun that killed Trayvon
HLCL-2816|we need better laws are told me there should be accountability whether you wear blue jeans a blue business suit or a blue uniform
HLCL-2817|we need accountability across the board and we're not getting that
HLCL-2818|the others agreed and they clearly weren't sure I'd turn out to be any different from the other politicians who already let them down
HLCL-2819|still they had accepted my invitation to this meeting in Chicago and we're generous with sharing their story
HLCL-2820|now they were waiting to see what I do
HLCL-2821|Lesley mcspadden was direct with me her eighteen-year-old son Michael Brown was shot and killed in 2014 by a police officer in Ferguson Missouri
HLCL-2822|are we going to see change Leslie asked
HLCL-2823|once again we're around a table we're pouring our hearts out we're getting emotional we tell you what we feel but are we going to see any change are we going to see some action
HLCL-2824|the politics of guns have been toxic for a long time
HLCL-2825|despite the fact that according to a June 2017 Quinnipiac University poll 94% of Americans support comprehensive background checks for gun sales including 92% of gun owners many politicians have shied away from taking on the NRA
HLCL-2826|the vocal minority of Voters against gun safety laws have historically been more organized better funded and more willing to be single-issue voters
HLCL-2827|in the 1990s my husband fought hard to pass but they 10-year ban on assault weapons and the Brady Bill
HLCL-2828|which for the first time required background checks on mini gun purchases at federally licensed firearms dealers
HLCL-2829|in the years since that law has blocked more than two million purchases by convicted felons domestic abusers and fugitives
HLCL-2830|the nra-funded intense backlash to the new safety measures and helped defeat a lot of democratic members of Congress in the disastrous 1994 midterm elections
HLCL-2831|then in 2000 the NRA helped beat Al Gore
HLCL-2832|after these steering political experience has it became convention
HLCL-2833|wisdom that it was safer for Democrats to say nothing at all about guns and hope the NRA stayed away
HLCL-2834|I never agreed with this approach I thought it was wrong on the policy and wrong on the politics
HLCL-2835|I've always hated I was proud that building ministration at taking on the NRA and won
HLCL-2836|my commitment to stopping senseless gun violence deepened after going to Littleton Colorado in 1999
HLCL-2837|bill and I visited with grieving family members of teenagers killed in the Columbine High School massacre
HLCL-2838|we huddled together over coffee cups and Memorial books in a local Catholic Church
HLCL-2839|I thought about those kids every day since I'd heard the news a month earlier
HLCL-2840|I was especially moved by the story of seventeen-year-old Cassie Bernall
HLCL-2841|press Accounts at the time said that one of the student Killers asked her if she believed in God
HLCL-2842|after Cassie said yes he shot her
HLCL-2843|I met Cassie's mother Misty I gave her a big hug and ask her to tell me about her daughter
HLCL-2844|we sat down together and started looking at photos
HLCL-2845|some of the Columbine families talk to Bill and me about what more could be done to keep other schools and families safe from gun violence
HLCL-2846|I believed we needed new measures that would go even further than what the Clinton administration had accomplished
HLCL-2847|later as a senator I represented rural Upstate New York as well as the cities
HLCL-2848|I understood and appreciated the perspective of law-abiding gun owners wary of any new regulations
HLCL-2849|I remembered my father teaching me to shoot in rural Pennsylvania where we spent Summers when I was growing up
HLCL-2850|I also lived in Arkansas for many years and went on a memorable December Duck Hunting Expedition with some friends in the 1980s
HLCL-2851|I'll never forget standing hip-deep in freezing water waiting for the sun to rise trying to Stave off hypothermia
HLCL-2852|I did manage to shoot a duck but when I got home Chelsea but just watched Bambi was outraged by the news that I'd shot some poor little ducks mommy or daddy
HLCL-2853|these experiences reinforce for me that for many Americans hunting and gun ownership are ingrained in the culture
HLCL-2854|many see them as links to our Frontier past into the age-old American ethic of self-reliance
HLCL-2855|for a lot of people being able to own a gun is a matter of fundamental freedom and self-defense it's also a source of security and confidence in a chaotic world
HLCL-2856|I understood all that it's why this issue is so emotionally charged for people on both sides of the debate it's intensely personal
HLCL-2857|all my political campaigns done my best to strike a fair balance between standing
HLCL-2858|Common Sense gun safety measures and showing respect for responsible gun owners
HLCL-2859|I've always said that I recognize a second amendment and have never proposed banning all guns
HLCL-2860|it even before I got into the 2016 race NRA Chief Wayne LaPierre promised his organization would fight with everything we've got to stop me from becoming president
HLCL-2861|he warns that if I won it would mean quote a permanent darkness of Deceit and despair forced upon the American people unquote
HLCL-2862|all he was missing with a tinfoil hat
HLCL-2863|LaPierre helped make the NRA one of the most reactionary and dangerous organizations in America
HLCL-2864|instead of being concerned with the interest of everyday gun owners many of whom support common-sense safety protections the NRA has essentially become a wholly-owned
HLCL-2865|theory of the powerful corporations that make and sell guns
HLCL-2866|their bottom line and twisted ideology Are All That Matters to them even if it costs thousands of American lives every year
HLCL-2867|I had a healthy appreciation for the political damage the NRA could do
HLCL-2868|I seen it before an expected worse this time
HLCL-2869|but I also knew that a lot of Swing voters especially women were as horrified by gun violence as I was and we're open to Smart solutions that would keep their families and communities safer
HLCL-2870|so I shook off the threats and got to work
HLCL-2871|my team and I collaborated with gun safety Advocates such as the organization Moms Demand Action to develop new proposals for keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and other violent criminals
HLCL-2872|I called for Universal background checks barring any
HLCL-2873|on the terrorist no-fly list from buying a gun and giving survivors and families the right to hold gun makers and sellers accountable
HLCL-2874|for example I believe that families who lost children in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut should be able to sue Remington Arms for marketing its AR-15 assault rifle to civilians
HLCL-2875|infuriated me that a special law gave gun manufacturers immunity from such suits
HLCL-2876|after the massacre of nine parishioners at mother Emanuel Church in Charleston South Carolina in June 2015
HLCL-2877|my team focused on why the 21 year old white supremacist killer was able to buy a gun despite having an arrest record that should have been flagged by the required background check
HLCL-2878|we found that under current law if a background check is not completed after 3 days a store is free to sell
HLCL-2879|gone with no questions asked this is the result of an amendment the NRA designed and push through Congress during the debate over the Brady Bill in 1993
HLCL-2880|experts say that more than 55,000 gun sales that should have been blocked have been allowed to proceed because of what we started calling the Charleston loophole
HLCL-2881|I made closing it and other gun loopholes a major part of my campaign
HLCL-2882|listening to the mother's stories in Chicago I was more sure than ever that taking on the gun lobby was the right thing to do whatever the cost
HLCL-2883|I told them about some of the reforms that my policy team have been working on and ask them to stay in touch with us and not be shy about sending ideas and criticisms
HLCL-2884|I said how much hearing their stories meant to me and how determined I was to be their champion
HLCL-2885|I'm sure my words failed me butts it was hard to express how honored I felt by their willingness to open up so completely with me
HLCL-2886|we're better than this and we need to act like we are I said
HLCL-2887|at our meeting broke up the mother started talking intensely among themselves
HLCL-2888|soon they were taking photos and making plans
HLCL-2889|many of them had never met before but they were already bonding like sisters
HLCL-2890|I saw how powerful they were together
HLCL-2891|later when they decided to go on the road for my campaign traveling around South Carolina and other early primary states to speak on my behalf
HLCL-2892|I was moved and grateful the mothers of the movement were born
HLCL-2893|I always look forward to running into the mothers out on the trail
HLCL-2894|on Hard Day's a hog or smile from them would give me an extra boost
HLCL-2895|and I made a point to be updated around
HLCL-2896|I figured there was enough sadness in their lives so the least I could do was to be cheerful with them
HLCL-2897|but it wasn't easy new tragedies kept unfolding
HLCL-2898|in July 2016 a black man named philando Castile was shot seven times during a traffic stop in the Twin Cities
HLCL-2899|while his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds in her four-year-old daughter sat in the car
HLCL-2900|later video show the little girl pleading with her mother to stay quiet so she wouldn't be killed as well
HLCL-2901|I don't want you to get shooted she said okay give me a kiss diamond responded
HLCL-2902|I can keep you safe her tiny daughter assured her before starting to cry
HLCL-2903|two weeks later I met with The Grieving family in Minnesota
HLCL-2904|and heard about how beloved Castile was in the community including at the magnet school in St Paul where he worked
HLCL-2905|quien Diamond had planned to get married that's a month five police officers were ambushed and killed by a sniper in Dallas while protecting a peaceful protest March
HLCL-2906|I was horrified by the news and quickly canceled an event I've been planning to do with Joe Biden and Scranton Pennsylvania
HLCL-2907|it didn't feel right to go to a campaign rally and the day after such a tragedy
HLCL-2908|instead I went to a conference of ministers in Philadelphia and paid tribute to the fallen officers and offered prayers for their families
HLCL-2909|I called Mayor Mike Rawlings and offered my support
HLCL-2910|Dallas police chief David Brown urged Americans to stand with the brave men and women who risk their lives to keep the rest of us safe
HLCL-2911|we don't feel much support most days let's not make today most days he said
HLCL-2912|I agreed completely less than two weeks later another three officers were ambushed
HLCL-2913|and killed in Baton Rouge Louisiana
HLCL-2914|and as I'm writing this a New York City police officer a mother-of-three was gunned down in Cold Blood
HLCL-2915|this violence against police against young black men and women against anyone must stop
HLCL-2916|since the election with the mothers of the movement
HLCL-2917|whenever I started to feel sorry for myself I've tried to remember how these mothers persevered through infinitely harder circumstances
HLCL-2918|they're still doing everything they can to make our country a better place
HLCL-2919|if they can so can I and so can we all
HLCL-2920|I think about how I sell standing with them in a prayer circle like we did at the Trayvon Martin foundation's annual dinner in Florida
HLCL-2921|eight of us leaning our heads together clasping hands looking down
HLCL-2922|word and contemplation one of the mothers let us in prayer her voice rising and falling as she thank God for making all things possible
HLCL-2923|I remember something when car said on our visit to the Central Baptist Church in Columbia South Carolina
HLCL-2924|in the first days after losing her son Eric she couldn't even get out of bed
HLCL-2925|but then she said the Lord talked to me and told me
HLCL-2926|are you going to lay here and die like your son
HLCL-2927|or are you going to get up and uplift his name
HLCL-2928|she realized in that moment that none of us can rest as long as there are others out there to be helped
HLCL-2929|she said I had to turn my sorrow into a strategy my morning into a movement
HLCL-2930|guns became a Flashpoint in both the primaries
HLCL-2931|and the general election Bernie Sanders who love to talk about how quote true progressives unquote never bowed to political realities or powerful interest
HLCL-2932|a long bow to the political reality of his rural state of Vermont and supported the NRA's key priorities including voting against the Brady Bill five times in the 1990s
HLCL-2933|in 2005 he voted for that special immunity law that protects gun makers and sellers from being sued when their weapons are used in deadly attacks
HLCL-2934|the NRA said the protection of lawful Commerce in arms Act was the most important John related legislation in more than 20 years
HLCL-2935|then-senator Barack Obama and I had voted against it
HLCL-2936|I couldn't believe Bernie continue to support the law 10 years later when he ran for president
HLCL-2937|I hammered him on the issue every chance I got
HLCL-2938|we had a revealing exchange Town Hall debate in March 2016
HLCL-2939|a man stepped up to the microphone to ask a question
HLCL-2940|his fourteen-year-old daughter had been shot in the head during a shooting spree outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant
HLCL-2941|after a few scary days on life support she pulled through and ended up being the Lone Survivor of the attack
HLCL-2942|the father asked what we were going to do to address the epidemic of gun violence stalking our country
HLCL-2943|I'm looking at your daughter and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery I said
HLCL-2944|but it never should have happened I told him about some of the steps I wanted to take to keep family safe
HLCL-2945|including repealing the immunity protection for gun manufacturers
HLCL-2946|the moderator then ask Bernie his thoughts about a new lawsuit challenging that corporate immunity
HLCL-2947|to my surprise the senator.
HLCL-2948|he argued passionately that people like me who talked about suing gunmakers we're really talking about ending gun Manufacturing in America
HLCL-2949|manufacturer could be held liable for what happens with its guns was tantamount to saying that there should not be any guns in America
HLCL-2950|I couldn't have disagreed more strongly
HLCL-2951|no other industry in our country as a kind of protection he supported for gun manufacturers
HLCL-2952|and then every other situation he was allowed us voice in the room calling for corporations to be held accountable for their actions
HLCL-2953|why was this one issue so different
HLCL-2954|as I told the crowd it was like he was reading straight from the NRA's talking points
HLCL-2955|after months of pressure from activist and victims families Bernie finally said he would reconsider his vote
HLCL-2956|Bernie and I disagreed on guns but the Republicans were far more extreme
HLCL-2957|just days after terrorists shot and killed 14 people and seriously injured 22 others that an office holiday party in San Bernardino California
HLCL-2958|Senate Republicans blocked a bill to stop individuals on the no-fly list from buying guns and explosives
HLCL-2959|I thought it was a no-brainer that if you are too dangerous to get on a plane you're too dangerous to buy a gun
HLCL-2960|but the Republicans refused to defy the NRA
HLCL-2961|then there was Donald Trump from the start of the campaign he did everything he could to ingratiate himself with the gun lobby which may have been wary that a New York billionaire history of being sympathetic to gun-control wouldn't be a natural Ally
HLCL-2962|so he overcompensated
HLCL-2963|promise to for schools to allow guns in classroom sent to overturn efforts President Obama made to strengthen the background check system
HLCL-2964|after the Rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg Oregon in which eight students and one Professor were killed
HLCL-2965|Trump call the attack horrible but didn't seem to think anything could be done about it
HLCL-2966|you're going to have these things happen and he said flippantly
HLCL-2967|after the June attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando that killed 49 young people many of them lgbtq people of color
HLCL-2968|Trump said it was too bad that people at the club didn't have guns attached to their hips even though all the research and a growing body count prove that more guns mean more deaths
HLCL-2969|Republicans like to rile up their base with tales about how I was going to shred the Constitution and take away their guns
HLCL-2970|it didn't matter that I said the opposite as clearly as I could
HLCL-2971|putting in my acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention
HLCL-2972|I'm not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment I'm not here to take away your guns I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place
HLCL-2973|I was used to being the gun Lobby's favorite villain
HLCL-2974|but as he so often did Trump took it to another level
HLCL-2975|in August 2016 he told a rally in North Carolina
HLCL-2976|if I were elected president there'd be no way to stop me from appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court
HLCL-2977|well he said maybe the Second Amendment people might find a way to stop me
HLCL-2978|many of us took that to mean maybe somebody would shoot me
HLCL-2979|Trump's remark caused a stir in the Press I was particularly concerned that if a second amendment person came after me he'd be coming after my security detail of Secret Service
HLCL-2980|his campaign tried to downplay the comment
HLCL-2981|but everyone heard the innuendo loud and clear
HLCL-2982|later there were reports that the Secret Service told Trump's team to get their candidate to knock it off
HLCL-2983|as for the NRA it kept its promise to do everything it could to stop me
HLCL-2984|all told the gun lobby spent more than 30 million dollars supporting Trump more money than any other outside group and more than double what it spent to support Mitt Romney in 2012
HLCL-2985|about two-thirds of that money paid for more than 10,000 negative ads attacking me in Battleground States
HLCL-2986|the organization didn't have the guts to take on my specific policy proposals which were widely popular even with a lot of gun owners
HLCL-2987|instead it went for fear-mongering and demonizing
HLCL-2988|woman is alone in bed when a robber breaks in
HLCL-2989|the house protected with nothing but the narrator suggesting falsely that I would have stopped law-abiding Americans from having a gun
HLCL-2990|I'm sure that some of my fellow Democrats will look at this high-priced Onslaught and conclude as many have in the past that standing up to the NRA just isn't worth it
HLCL-2991|Summit safety on The Chopping Block alongside reproductive so as not to distract from populist economics
HLCL-2992|who knows the same might happen to Criminal Justice Reform and racial Justice more broadly
HLCL-2993|that would be a terrible mistake democrats should not respond to my defeat by retreating from our strong commitments on these life-or-death issues
HLCL-2994|the vast majority of Americans agree that we need to do more on gun safety
HLCL-2995|this is a debate we can win if we keep at it
HLCL-2996|as I met more survivors of gun violence and the families of victims I was amazed at how many share the mothers of the movement's conviction that they had to channel their private pain into public action
HLCL-2997|one of the most powerful voices came from someone who had trouble speaking former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head in 2011 while meeting with constituents in the parking lot of a Tucson supermarket
HLCL-2998|before the shooting Gabby was a rising political star brilliant magnetic and effective
HLCL-2999|after the shooting she had to persevere through intense physical therapy and relearn how to walk and talk
HLCL-3000|nonetheless she and her husband the former astronaut and spider pilot Captain Mark Kelly became passionate advocate
HLCL-3001|gun safety I love campaigning with them and watching crowds fall in love with Gabby just as I had
HLCL-3002|speaking is difficult for me she would say but come January I want to say these two words Madam president
HLCL-3003|other advocates for Less famous but no less courageous including the families of Sandy Hook Elementary victims in Newtown Connecticut
HLCL-3004|every time I tried to talk about the massacre of little children that happened at that school in 2012 I started to choke up
HLCL-3005|I don't know how some of the grieving parents found the strength to share their experiences at campaign events but I will always be grateful that they did
HLCL-3006|Nicole Hockley join me at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire
HLCL-3007|her six-year-old son Dylan was shot to death despite a special education teachers heroic efforts to Shield him from
HLCL-3008|bullets after the massacre
HLCL-3009|Nicole became the managing director of Sandy Hook promise an organization that is trained nearly two million people across the country to identify potentially violent behavior and intervene before there's a dangerous attack
HLCL-3010|Nicole's Partners at Sandy Hook promise is Mark Barden
HLCL-3011|his seven-year-old son Daniel was killed that day
HLCL-3012|Mark remembers how in the morning of the shooting Daniel woke up early so that he and Mark could watch the sunrise together
HLCL-3013|and when it came time for his older brother Jake to go to school
HLCL-3014|Daniel ran down the driveway to give him a hug and kiss goodbye
HLCL-3015|after the shooting Mark and his wife Jackie were the ones who sued Remington Arms the company that makes the military-grade weapon the killer used in the attack
HLCL-3016|they argued that Remington should be held responsible
HLCL-3017|well for selling and marketing military weapons to civilians
HLCL-3018|the case has been dismissed and is now on appeal
HLCL-3019|then there's nelba marquez-greene who spoke with me at an event in Hartford Connecticut
HLCL-3020|she lost her six-year-old daughter Anna at Sandy Hook
HLCL-3021|the night before the shooting she and her husband took Anna and Isaiah and his younger brother out for a family dinner at the Cheesecake Factory
HLCL-3022|they splurged and ordered two rounds of dessert
HLCL-3023|Isaiah also a Sandy Hook student heard the shots that killed his sister from a nearby classroom
HLCL-3024|the family buried Anna 2 days before Christmas her on open gifts sitting under the tree
HLCL-3025|test for troubled use the Ana Grace Project
HLCL-3026|which trains teachers and schools had to reduce social isolation and creates a
HLCL-3027|and welcoming communities for students at the start of the school year following the shooting
HLCL-3028|Nelda Road in open letter to the teachers in their District
HLCL-3029|when you Google Hero there should be a picture of a principal a school lunch worker a custodian
HLCL-3030|a reading specialist a teacher
HLCL-3031|or a bus monitor she wrote real heroes don't wear capes they work in America's schools
HLCL-3032|one of those Heroes was Dawn hochsprung the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary
HLCL-3033|when John heard the gunshots she raced into the hallway
HLCL-3034|she saw the gunman and lunged at him to knock the weapon out of his hands
HLCL-3035|she died trying to protect her students
HLCL-3036|during the campaign I meant Don's grown daughter Erica smigielski
HLCL-3037|when she died Don had been helping Erica plan her summer wedding
HLCL-3038|Erica couldn't imagine walking down the aisle without her mom
HLCL-3039|but slowly she pees her life back together and managed to have a joyous wedding celebration
HLCL-3040|then Erica went to work at everytown for gun safety Mike Bloomberg's organization that advocates for common sense gun laws
HLCL-3041|Erica threw herself into my campaign speaking all over the country and telling her story and a powerful television ad
HLCL-3042|she wants told me that I reminded her of dawn
HLCL-3043|it's a compliment I'll never forget as hard as the politics of guns are and as divided as the country feels we've got to do better
HLCL-3044|the NRA can spend all at once Donald Trump and pal around with Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who is called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax
HLCL-3045|what a Despicable lie there on the wrong side of Justice
HLCL-3046|three basic human decency
HLCL-3047|and it's because of the Sandy Hook parents the mothers of the movement and so many other incredibly Brave survivors and family members that I know in my heart that one day we will stem the tide and save lives
HLCL-3048|I think about something I heard Erica say during the campaign
HLCL-3049|she was explaining how she picked herself up after the loss of her mother and decided to devote her life to gun safety
HLCL-3050|what if everyone faced tough odds said it's hard so I'm going to walk away she asked
HLCL-3051|that's not the type of world I want to live in
HLCL-3052|me neither Erica I love people who hardest themselves an ox to a heavy card
HLCL-3053|loophole like water buffalo with massive patients who strain in the mud and the Moc to move things forward who do what has to be done again and again
HLCL-3054|Marge Piercy idealism and realism
HLCL-3055|service is the rent we pay for living it is a very purpose of life and not something you do in your spare time
HLCL-3056|Marian Wright Edelman changemakers
HLCL-3057|one of the most persistent challenges I faced at the candidate was being perceived as a defender of the status quo while my opponents in the primaries and the general elections he's the sought-after mantle of change
HLCL-3058|the same thing happened to me in 2008 I never could figure out how to shake it
HLCL-3059|change maybe the most powerful word in American politics
HLCL-3060|it's also one of the hardest to Define in 1992 and 2008 change mint electing Dynamic young leaders who promised hope and renewal
HLCL-3061|in 2016 it meant handing a lit match to a pyromaniac
HLCL-3062|the Yearning For Change Springs from deep in the character of our Restless question constantly Reinventing itself country
HLCL-3063|that's part of what makes America great but we don't always spend enough time thinking about what it takes to actually make the change we seek changes hard that's one reason we're sometimes taken in by leaders who make it sound easy but don't have any idea how to get anything done
HLCL-3064|too often we fail to think big enough or act fast enough and let opportunities for change slip away
HLCL-3065|are we don't have the patience to see things through
HLCL-3066|I've been thinking about what it means to be a change maker for
HLCL-3067|my life my journey took me from student activists to Citizen Advocate to politician policymaker
HLCL-3068|along the way I never stopped searching for the right balance of idealism and realism
HLCL-3069|sometimes I had to make painful compromises
HLCL-3070|but I've also had the great privilege of meeting people whose lives were healthier Freer and Fuller because of my work
HLCL-3071|today despite losing in 2016 I am more convinced than ever that driving progress in a big raucous democracy like ours requires a mix of principle and pragmatism plus a whole lot of persistence
HLCL-3072|nobody did more to help me understand this and Marian Wright Edelman the founder of the children's defense fund and my first boss
HLCL-3073|when I met her in the spring of 1970 her accomplishments were already stunning
HLCL-3074|she was the first black woman to pass the bar exam in Mississippi after having graduated from Yale Law School in 1963
HLCL-3075|she became a civil rights lawyer for the n-double-acp in Jackson and established a Head Start program for poor kids who desperately needed it
HLCL-3076|Marion works with dr. King and open Bobby Kennedy's eyes to the reality of poverty in America by taking him to Tiny Shacks in the Mississippi Delta and introducing him to children so hungry they were nearly catatonic
HLCL-3077|Marion showed me what it takes to make real and Lasting change she gave me my start as an activist help me to account as I grew into a national leader and was there for me when things fell apart as a candidate
HLCL-3078|I was in my early twenties when I met Marion but I'd already spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to Be an Effective activist
HLCL-3079|my parents especially my mother raised me and
HLCL-3080|Brothers in the Methodist tradition of faith in action
HLCL-3081|at church we were taught to be doers of the word not hearers only
HLCL-3082|Batman stepping outside the pews rolling up our sleeves and doing all the good you can for all the people in all the ways you can as long as ever you can
HLCL-3083|that Credo attributed to the founder of methodism John Wesley inspired generations of Methodist to volunteer in hospitals schools and slums
HLCL-3084|for me growing up in a comfortable middle-class suburb it provided a sense of purpose and Direction pointing me toward a life of Public Service
HLCL-3085|my activist Faith was sharpened by the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s
HLCL-3086|in college and law school my friends and I spent many long nights debating the morality and efficacy of Civil Disobedience dodging the draft and other four
HLCL-3087|set resistance what would it take to end an unjust war in Vietnam expand civil rights and women's rights and combat poverty and Injustice
HLCL-3088|should I Goldie reform or revolution consensus or conflict should we protest or participate
HLCL-3089|the last of which we considered ourselves a part was divided
HLCL-3090|radicals talked about Revolution and believe conflict was the only way to drive change
HLCL-3091|not surprisingly more with the liberals who argued that the system had to be reformed from the inside
HLCL-3092|partly it was a question of temperament I'm a pragmatist by both nature and nurture
HLCL-3093|but I was also watching and learning as a vent swirled around me
HLCL-3094|a12 I tried to find ways to push the college toward more Progressive positions to negotiation rather than disruption
HLCL-3095|I ran for Student Government president in 1968 because I thought I could do a good job convincing College administrators to make changes that students wanted
HLCL-3096|my platform included adding students to faculty committees recruiting more students and faculty of color opening up the curriculum and easing curfews and other social restrictions
HLCL-3097|I won and spent the next year trying to translate the demands of rest of students into measurable change on campus
HLCL-3098|that summer I was in Chicago's Grant Park when anti-war protest outside the Democratic National Convention turned into a melee that shocked the nation
HLCL-3099|my longtime close friend Betsy ebeling and I narrowly missed being hit by a rock thrown by someone in the crowd behind us
HLCL-3100|mayor Richard Daley's police force was clearly more to blame for the violence and the kids in the park were but the whole scene left me worried that the anti-war movement was
HLCL-3101|that would help elect Richard Nixon and prolong the war
HLCL-3102|it was a terrifying infuriating exhilarating and confusing time to be a young activist in America
HLCL-3103|in May 1970 just a few days after four unarmed college student protesters were shot and killed by national Guardsmen on the campus of Kent State University in Ohio I spoke to the 50th Anniversary Convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington
