      Hillary: They have figured out how to fish with spears. There's primatolgists that.
      <br><br>
      Neil: Wait. Wait. Without somebody showing them how to fish?
      <br><br>
      Hillary: No. No. They have imitated human beings doing it. And now they do it, they do it independently they're not trained orangutans. They're wild, look at that.
      <br><br>
      Neil: Oh thats impressive. Very Impressive wow.
      <br><br>
      Hillary: Well there's these primatologist I guess you would call them primatologists. Biologists that believe that monkeys and chimps and some of the great apes are moving into the Stone Age that they've currently entered the Stone Age.
