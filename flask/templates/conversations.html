        Barack: I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what, I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal. The deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. How many of those have survived? Over 7 million people have contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?

        Hillary: Barack, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this
        <br><br>
        Barack: Im happy to talk about this
        <br><br>
        Hillary: And if you were here, it wouldnt be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban 
        <br><br>
        Barack: Well, let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v Wade. That's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. And so that's also at stake, right now. 
        <br><br>
        Hillary: You dont know thats on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot, Why is it on the ballot. It's not on the ballot
        <br><br>
        Barack: Its on the ballot in the court
        <br><br>
        Hillary: I dont think so. There's nothing happening there. You dont know her view on Roe v Wade. All right.
