NDGTYT-1||[Music] so chuck how often do you think about pollution
NDGTYT-2||quite a bit honestly i mean you know i have because you're a green guy
NDGTYT-3||you're a green guy one guy i think about it quite a bit and and and the uh deleterious effect that is having on our
NDGTYT-4||uh our existence our ecosystem so so not all pollution is made of plastic
NDGTYT-5||so very early on the astronomers of the world
NDGTYT-6||have complained about light pollution when you had the electrification of the cities
NDGTYT-7||all of a sudden the night sky was competing with lights that were shedding photons
NDGTYT-8||up into the atmosphere and i grew up in a city so i had no understanding of the night sky until my
NDGTYT-9||first visit to the hayden planetarium at age nine nice and i know it was nice and i looked up and the lights dimmed and
NDGTYT-10||the stars came out i said this before i'll say it again i thought it was a hoax way too many stars
NDGTYT-11||how that is up there i don't know what this is i'll go along with it for now but stop trying to pull my leg next time
NDGTYT-12||i come back show it how it really is fake names fake news it was totally fake news right and
NDGTYT-13||and to this day from mountaintops when i've gone to high level mountaintops with high level
NDGTYT-14||telescopes i look up at the night sky and i say it reminds me of the hayden planetarium
NDGTYT-15||that's an urban urban frame of reference urban frame of reference that was so plus i'm old
NDGTYT-16||enough to remember what not only was there light pollution as there still is but back then there was also air
NDGTYT-17||pollution and today we think of the polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide carbon
NDGTYT-18||dioxide is transparent so that's not what i was thinking at the time i was thinking auto exhaust and
NDGTYT-19||and this sort of thing so not only did lights but auto exhaust disrupt your ability to see all objects in the night
NDGTYT-20||sky especially the dimmest objects and we should do a whole explainer on noise of all kinds so remind me to do
NDGTYT-21||this yes but let me let me just say if you can if you're in a perfect dark night and you can just barely see a very
NDGTYT-22||dim star and then other light gets added to this the first things to go are the dimmest
NDGTYT-23||stars so you start hacking away at the dimmest things available to you simply because other light is competing with it
NDGTYT-24||and it no longer shows up in on your retina or even in a in a camera so these are problems
NDGTYT-25||and so we've been living with this like our whole lives in fact there's something
NDGTYT-26||called the ida international id international international dark sky association okay they sound like a group
NDGTYT-27||of super villains the idea that's all i'm saying [Laughter]
NDGTYT-28||that's all i can tell you about them yes exactly so we've called this meaning of the
NDGTYT-29||international dark sky association to finalize our plans to permanently block out the sun
NDGTYT-30||that is true dark skies for everyone 24 hours a day like that's so funny i've never heard of that
NDGTYT-31||and how much will it cost it will cost a million dollars sir i just want to let you know that's
NDGTYT-32||not a lot of money these days okay five million what's the inflation rate how how much
NDGTYT-33||should we ask for should we ask for something more did he had with that whole conversation
NDGTYT-34||in the movie i think so it was i don't know how it went to be honest but it was something like that just like
NDGTYT-35||and how much now is it so they that organization has gotten more and more powerful and more
NDGTYT-36||power not in a let's override you but there's a lot of interesting sensible things to do for example
NDGTYT-37||let's say you're in an airplane and you're flying over a city and you look down you see the suburbs and you see the
NDGTYT-38||street lights illuminating the streets right at night from your airplane right do you know why you can
NDGTYT-39||see the street light because it's bright i don't know
NDGTYT-40||because somebody in that town is paying for electricity to go into this lamp to generate photons that are going up in to
NDGTYT-41||the through the window of my airplane i got you so i got you like a lantern the lights going everywhere everywhere not
NDGTYT-42||directed you don't need the light everywhere do you watch it on this street if i see your light it means you
NDGTYT-43||are paying to illuminate my airplane flying overhead if you can see any light at all
NDGTYT-44||directly from its source somebody's paying to illuminate the sky right so the ida simply makes the economic
NDGTYT-45||argument do you want to save money okay so you put a little hat on each lamp well that's adorable now wait a minute
NDGTYT-46||and make it reflective so hey that light that used to be going upwards is now coming downwards and i don't need
NDGTYT-47||that much light i was wasting half of it right so now i can cut the wattage in half or by
NDGTYT-48||whatever fraction right use less light and now i'm not illuminating the airplanes flying overhead it's that
NDGTYT-49||simple and that's why we don't do it because it's that it's simple because
NDGTYT-50||and anything that simple we just can't do it which can't wrap our head so the town of tucson arizona which is proximal
NDGTYT-51||to kitt peak mountain which has kid peak observatory which is one of the major
NDGTYT-52||observatories of the nation's astronomers long ago came into an agreement with the municipal leaders to
NDGTYT-53||say look i can if you're if your place keeps getting brighter we can't do our science
NDGTYT-54||we got to move our base because the home base is in town where all the scientists hang out before they go to the mountain
NDGTYT-55||and so but they like this distinction plus arizona is beautiful and it's got deserts and you know so why not preserve
NDGTYT-56||it all and so they got together and their ordinances city ordinances that control how bright the lights can be how
NDGTYT-57||what what kind of hat should be on them when you should turn them off all of this
NDGTYT-58||and so that was successful that became a model for other towns to emulate
NDGTYT-59||and so that's the light pollution and and like they said the air pollution is essentially gone relative to when i was
NDGTYT-60||growing up when i was growing up i'd come home from school from elementary school you could brush the ash off your
NDGTYT-61||shoulders okay from incinerated garbage that had gone into the sky and descended back to earth that is just crazy it was
NDGTYT-62||snowing garbage snowing ash correct every every day that's amazing yeah yeah so now so that's that
NDGTYT-63||but we have more pollution than that right wait let me just say this about the light pollution that i just thought
NDGTYT-64||about right now because of what you just said uh when they were building the big
NDGTYT-65||hotels in atlantic city of course i'm from philly so atlantic city they were building these giant hotels um
NDGTYT-66||and uh the conservationists uh in the area the scientists that you
NDGTYT-67||know care for animals and sea life and birds they
NDGTYT-68||basically realize that you're killing all the birds because they never know that it's nighttime
NDGTYT-69||yeah and people okay so at least i didn't lose my at least i didn't lose my life over this
NDGTYT-70||yeah wow so the bird just completely disrupting all of their
NDGTYT-71||everything they they have worse no more circadian rhythm and they were flying until and they were dying of exhaustion
NDGTYT-72||and all kinds of crazy stuff it was it was a weird little study that they did but
NDGTYT-73||i don't know what they did about it because they haven't changed anything but i think the consensus from the
NDGTYT-74||public was they're seagulls who gives a crap [Laughter]
NDGTYT-75||she goes in pigeons right we've got plenty of those pigeons plenty more of them where they came from you want us to
NDGTYT-76||care about that dirt i mean first of all we could see if they were chickens they're delicious but
NDGTYT-77||it was terrible it was terrible so chuck is not only light pollution that worries astronomers
NDGTYT-78||when we think of light you think of like visible light right but we don't only use visible light to communicate with
NDGTYT-79||the universe or to receive the universe we also have radio waves huge radio telescopes okay
NDGTYT-80||well wait a minute we have tv right you know am fm satellite microwave all those are in the radio parts of the
NDGTYT-81||spectrum so not only is there light pollution with visible light that interferes your eyes from seeing
NDGTYT-82||dim objects there's radio wave pollution that prevents our radio telescopes from seeing dim objects
NDGTYT-83||right so other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum are also polluted and so our
NDGTYT-84||best radio telescopes have to be put in places where there's like a radio free zone around it
NDGTYT-85||all right just so that we don't get noise radio noise coming in disrupting our observations of radio galaxies the
NDGTYT-86||microwave background of the formation of the universe and all of this well there you go people cool it on the hot pockets
NDGTYT-87||microwave okay take it easy on the hot pockets people and you know what else uh the remote fobs for cars right also
NDGTYT-88||creates a background noise of radio waves wow to a radio telescope that is extremely
NDGTYT-89||sensitive so uh leaving the realm of light in that sense there's also a new kind of
NDGTYT-90||pollution called satellite pollution oh my gosh and so what happens here is
NDGTYT-91||the effect of this is the satellite is moving across your field of view and it's reflecting sunlight so you get a
NDGTYT-92||streak so other parts of your photo might be okay but suppose that street goes to the
NDGTYT-93||one object you're trying to look at right so you need a way to sort of subtract it out from the process we have
NDGTYT-94||people working on software to accomplish that right now we don't know how this is all going to shake out in the coming
NDGTYT-95||years so we're pre-loading our our data reduction utilities just to try to subtract them out i i'm told i
NDGTYT-96||just attended a a workshop on on satellite pollution where there was an agreement with elon musk for some of his
NDGTYT-97||satellites to use a a sunshade okay right so even though they're up there they will the the sun the sun will
NDGTYT-98||not reflect off of it down to us and it did improve the seeing conditions it did improve it
NDGTYT-99||but i think the whatever might be a long-term solution to this has not yet arrived
NDGTYT-100||so that that's what we're in the middle of now that is kind of crazy
NDGTYT-101||and the current most powerful telescope on earth okay is called the vera rubin telescope and it is designed to take
NDGTYT-102||movies of the night sky every single night that is pretty dope okay because think about
NDGTYT-103||it up until now we've been taking just snapshots okay so if the thing did something different an hour later after
NDGTYT-104||you're on the way back to the computer you missed it tough time you missed it missed out okay
NDGTYT-105||uh so it's taking a movie so that it's called um uh there's an entire branch of my field
NDGTYT-106||that concerns itself with things that change over time right because most images you're seeing
NDGTYT-107||is just a static picture of something right so the people who care about stuff that's changes in the universe
NDGTYT-108||this will be a delight for them and but now that we're taking movies we basically have movies of all these
NDGTYT-109||satellites crossing our field of view and we have to distinguish between that and what might be a killer asteroid
NDGTYT-110||moving across the field of view because this has an asteroid alert system built in
NDGTYT-111||wow so without i mean this sounds more
NDGTYT-112||important than it might appear because this ain't just looking at a telescope and going what is that oh
NDGTYT-113||that's some little elon musk junk don't worry about it and then it ends up being a killer
NDGTYT-114||asteroid yeah what is that oh that's a killer asteroid that we almost mistook for an elon musk satellite right right
NDGTYT-115||yeah right so yeah that's what we're confronting with right now
NDGTYT-116||the the buckets of pollution that influence the modern astrophysicist knows no bounds wow and none of it has
NDGTYT-117||anything to do with plastic or carbon dioxide what do you think of that well what we should have is an astrophysicist
NDGTYT-118||standing next to a rocket with a single tear rolling down [Laughter]
NDGTYT-119||that'll be a public service announcement all right right i'll volunteer i'll be the tiering
NDGTYT-120||astrophysicist for that space pollution you only you can stop spacecraft space pollution
NDGTYT-121||all right chuck that's all the time we got all right that was great all right the pollution the astronomers edition on
NDGTYT-122||star talk yet another explainer video neil degrasse tyson keep looking up [Music]
NDGTYT-123||you
