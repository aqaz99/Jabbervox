Stats for training
Feb 22:
 - MCDM 2971 wav files
   Total training time 91 minutes 50 seconds
   3 Models generated, Personal model score(1-100):
   Model 1 - 0
   Model 2 - 0
   Model 3 - 0
   Notes: Something seems to have gone wrong with the training, all 3 models that were generated are terrible
   and are either generating a static note in an eery tone or skipping percussively. No discernable words can be heard.


Current issues. I am currently dealing with not enough GPU RAM, causing my model trainings to fail. 
Maybe I need to reduce the sample rate? That could lowers the file size possibly(also the quality) but cause 
less not enough ram issues. Also, I have reduced the batch size on several occasions for various training methods
but I would rather avoid that



General training notes:
When I convert the speech to text and then use a speech recognizer to determine what was said, the accuracy is about 90%,
so there is inherently some error in the training data. The recognizer has a much easier time with Hillary Clintons voice but
often times struggles to determine what Obama said. So I combed through parts of the metadata file for Obama and corrected errors.
It typically had issues detecting the beggining words for sentences and very often dropped the word 'the'. 
Also, it has about 70% accuracy for determining:
 - 'the' vs 'a'
 - 'or' vs 'our' vs 'for'
 - 'I've been' vs 'often'

Other notes: Recognizer interpreted the word 'tootoo' as '22'
