MCDM-0|his body is disintegrating he is not of this world and the strain of being here is killing him he is not like us he is
MCDM-1|not one of us he can do amazing things he has one chance to return to his people if he can make it to the
MCDM-2|rendezvous coordinates at the appointed time he will live he will leave us and return to the world he belongs him if he
MCDM-3|fails he dies there are humans who care about him aid him but there are other humans chasing him they want to use him
MCDM-4|or study him he doesn't want to dissect the visitor he just wants to understand and when he does understand he will help
MCDM-5|that's the plot of three different movies each one about a different alien about the humans who help the alien and
MCDM-6|the humans chasing an alien of the three films that follow this plot the pivotal one is John Carpenter's 1984 forgotten
MCDM-7|masterpiece Starman carpenter delivered his first masterpiece two years earlier in 1982 the chilling intensely watchable
MCDM-8|the thing it remains one of my favorite movies the thing opened a few weeks after the first movie to use this plot
MCDM-9|Steven Spielberg's et and et crushed the thing it crushed a lot of movies that summer all of which are more often
MCDM-10|watched and talked about now it crushed Blade Runner filmmakers in the early 80s hoped to use the new explosion in
MCDM-11|science fiction to tell challenging stories but really what everyone wanted was to spend two hours with a cute alien
MCDM-12|the thing was John Carpenter's attempt to make a Howard Hawks movie make a taut masculine action thriller and for my
MCDM-13|money he got as close as you can get without being Howard Hawks people talk about the thing as a masterpiece of
MCDM-14|horror but really I think it's just a brilliant movie forget the genre if the thing had been a hit I think John
MCDM-15|Carpenter would have turned into one of our greatest directors but it wasn't a hit it cost a lot of money and it tanked
MCDM-16|there's a danger when you fail to make enough money for the studio that you'll never get a second chance and Carpenter
MCDM-17|knew it so when he got a second chance he didn't waste it he hit another home run just a show he could do it he said
MCDM-18|oh you want nice aliens fine and delivered Starman a better movie than ET in every way except there's a scene in
MCDM-19|ET where they play Dungeons & Dragons that's cool Carpenter described Starman as his apology to Hollywood for the
MCDM-20|thing I'm sorry I scared the out of you please let me keep making movies alas it
MCDM-21|was too late Starman came in number 30 at the box office that here and carpenter never got a third chance
MCDM-22|to be a major director in Hollywood thanks et et is whether he likes it or not the progenitor of the plotline from
MCDM-23|Jeff Nichols as new film Midnight Special same story the only innovation here is
MCDM-24|making the kid from et the alien but Nicholas didn't want to make et he wanted to make star man he talks about
MCDM-25|it in interviews Nichols said he wanted to make a 1980s John Carpenter movie as though 1980s John Carpenter is a genre
MCDM-26|all its own which maybe it is he said he thought star man was a good place to start he started there but having
MCDM-27|watched midnight special he doesn't seem to have gone anywhere with it star man is in always a more interesting
MCDM-28|rewarding movie Midnight Special raises all the same questions a star man and has just as many answers they're just
MCDM-29|not as interesting in fact they're baffling in their lack of imagination midnight special opens on a black screen
MCDM-30|a radio playing and what we learn is a motel room before we see anything we hear a commercial for a Fort Worth
MCDM-31|Nissan dealership so we know we're in Texas visit WWE em so we know it's the modern day but it doesn't look like the
MCDM-32|modern day everyone in this film the way they dress the cars they drive look like the 1970s just kept going given that
MCDM-33|he's basically remaking a movie set 35 years ago maybe that's nickels his point he likes
MCDM-34|stuff from back then so he made his movie looked like something from back then the film looks great like Starman
MCDM-35|Midnight Special spends all its time on the highways and gas stations and back roads of the American South this is
MCDM-36|Nicholas's territory and he makes it look amazing it's beautiful it's just kind of boring with the possible
MCDM-37|exception of atom drivers character and no one in this movie talks or behaves like a normal person we spend the entire
MCDM-38|movie with a young boy Alton and his parents but no one ever says I love you no one has a nickname for Alton no one
MCDM-39|ever calls him champ or a sport or snicklefritz everyone so in awe of him including his parents who should
MCDM-40|remember a time when their kid was more normal before we could hear and decode encrypted radio broadcasts and other
MCDM-41|languages but they all treat him as though there was never time when he was just their son they act like he was
MCDM-42|always an alien it seems like there was never a point when their lives were normal it would have been nice to see a
MCDM-43|hint of a time before the movie started I love the sentiment his father expresses when Alton says you don't have
MCDM-44|to worry about me Michael Shannon says I'll always worry about you that's the deal he never says he loves his son
MCDM-45|but he says he'll always worry about him I like worrying about you he says baby that's nickels this point love means
MCDM-46|spending your life worrying about someone Michael Shannon is amazing to watch act but apart from the look
MCDM-47|worried and desperate he hasn't given anything else to do every scene he's in it is the same you can mix them up watch
MCDM-48|them in any order still make sense I wanted an ark some humanity something they've got Sam Shepard in this movie
MCDM-49|who was a brilliant actor and writer and we see him for like two minutes and that's it
MCDM-50|crazy to waste him like that Adam drivers amused detached curiosity is fun to watch and gosh I wish we'd gotten
MCDM-51|more that now I think I would have liked the movie more if the whole thing had been from his point of view
MCDM-52|probably the narrative wouldn't sustain that too much of a good thing but unlike everyone else in the movie every time he
MCDM-53|is on screen I was happy and entertained and keen to see what happened next he has more in common with Alton than
MCDM-54|anyone else in the picture he finds everyone even the government he works for amusing and they're clueless
MCDM-55|sincerity and earnestness I was intensely interested in Midnight Special when I first heard about it I haven't
MCDM-56|seen Nichols as other work I didn't really know what to expect but the previews completely hooked me and I've
MCDM-57|spent the last two months spreading the gospel I spent two and a half hours in traffic to see it in LA this weekend I
MCDM-58|wanted to believe but I don't think there was much to believe in Starr man has an arc the title character has an
MCDM-59|arc the woman he kidnaps has an arc Jeff Bridges is playing a complex character with a lot going on into the surface
MCDM-60|Karen Allen is playing a complex character with a lot going on under the surface they are each going through the
MCDM-61|same experience but from opposite directions and that makes it interesting every time Jeff Bridges as alien talks
MCDM-62|does anything we learn something amazing we see something amazing the plot advances his mystery expands and
MCDM-63|tantalizes and moves us it's a remarkably fer tiles to crypt each sequence shows us something new and
MCDM-64|unexpected midnight special is basically the same scene repeated for two hours we never really learned anything about
MCDM-65|Alton he does some amazing stuff often using the same special effects with star man but it doesn't move the plot forward
MCDM-66|or teach us anything about his character when the alien in star man finally meets the government scientist who's been
MCDM-67|curious about him the whole time we get an amazing scene it's sentimental and obvious but sometimes that's what a
MCDM-68|movie demands that same scene in Midnight Special has nothing no information no pathos in star man we
MCDM-69|learn something about the aliens and we learn some about ourselves and midnight special we
MCDM-70|just get a white room and a kid who can do tricks when Alton finally tells us what the
MCDM-71|hell is going on it's baffling I don't mean incomprehensible I mean I was baffled this was their answer I don't
MCDM-72|belong here he says yeah we guessed that but and this is important no explanation is given as to why like he is apparently
MCDM-73|Kirsten Dunst and Michael Shannon's biological kid but he's also an alien from another world what there's a
MCDM-74|profound lack of thought put into the explanation for why everything happens in this movie and I got the sense it was
MCDM-75|meant to be more mystical than science fictional but regardless of whether it's science or fantasy the ending needs to
MCDM-76|pay off the rest of the film star man has a great explanation for everything that's happening everything in star man
MCDM-77|makes a logical sense from the opening premise that mankind has been sending messages to aliens which is true by the
MCDM-78|way we have we really made a spaceship and sent it out of the solar system with a message from Earth on it inviting any
MCDM-79|aliens who find it to come visit us I'm not making that up it's real and everything in star man logically follows
MCDM-80|from it nothing in midnight special makes any sense and when we finally get the closing reveal showing us Alton's
MCDM-81|world it's it's pretty disappointing this is apparently the revelatory religious experience everyone's been
MCDM-82|having when they look in Alton's eyes and the only thing I can conclude is they don't have concept artists in Texas
MCDM-83|or Louisiana like go buy an art book guys go look at a yes album cover from the 1970s Google Sid meat or fangs ooh
MCDM-84|come on I felt the pressure Starman exerted on this film jeff nichols said he wanted to make a movie
MCDM-85|like Star Man but he clearly didn't feel he could just remake that film he didn't feel he could just lift that plot he
MCDM-86|needed to make his own version but his versions explanation for everything is so weak as to completely deflate all
MCDM-87|attention leading up to it when your whole movie is the mystery the mystery needs to be damn good if you've got
MCDM-88|great characters and dialogue and we just love spending time with these people
MCDM-89|then we won't notice much if the destination isn't that interesting but if the journey is flat and monotonous
MCDM-90|you really need a hell of a destination to make it all worthwhile and midnight special acts that star man had great
MCDM-91|characters quotable dialogue great journey great destination Midnight Special doesn't great actors movie looks
MCDM-92|beautiful otherwise there's a scene at the end the last shot in fact I'm not going to spoil it
MCDM-93|that's meant to send us out of the theater wondering leave us with a question but after the events in
MCDM-94|Midnight Special I'm not particularly interested in engaging with that question the movie
MCDM-95|didn't give me any reason to believe there might be an interesting answer there it just made me want to go watch
MCDM-96|star man again maybe et that's why I thought of midnight special let me know what you
MCDM-97|thought if you liked this I'll probably do more reviews in the future movie reviews is something I've been doing
MCDM-98|your semi regularly for the last 20 years on that website and now I've got a camera and I set up here and I thought
MCDM-99|I'd make a video if you liked it I'll make more if you didn't like it I'll probably still make more but I will be
MCDM-100|less excited about it until next time peace out
