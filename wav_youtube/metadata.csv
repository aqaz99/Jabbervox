MCDM-0||his body is disintegrating he is not of this world and the strain of being here is killing him he is not like us he is
MCDM-1||not one of us he can do amazing things he has one chance to return to his people if he can make it to the
MCDM-2||rendezvous coordinates at the appointed time he will live he will leave us and return to the world he belongs him if he
MCDM-3||fails he dies there are humans who care about him aid him but there are other humans chasing him they want to use him
MCDM-4||or study him he doesn't want to dissect the visitor he just wants to understand and when he does understand he will help
MCDM-5||that's the plot of three different movies each one about a different alien about the humans who help the alien and
MCDM-6||the humans chasing an alien of the three films that follow this plot the pivotal one is John Carpenter's 1984 forgotten
MCDM-7||masterpiece Starman carpenter delivered his first masterpiece two years earlier in 1982 the chilling intensely watchable
MCDM-8||the thing it remains one of my favorite movies the thing opened a few weeks after the first movie to use this plot
MCDM-9||Steven Spielberg's et and et crushed the thing it crushed a lot of movies that summer all of which are more often
MCDM-10||watched and talked about now it crushed Blade Runner filmmakers in the early 80s hoped to use the new explosion in
MCDM-11||science fiction to tell challenging stories but really what everyone wanted was to spend two hours with a cute alien
MCDM-12||the thing was John Carpenter's attempt to make a Howard Hawks movie make a taut masculine action thriller and for my
MCDM-13||money he got as close as you can get without being Howard Hawks people talk about the thing as a masterpiece of
MCDM-14||horror but really I think it's just a brilliant movie forget the genre if the thing had been a hit I think John
MCDM-15||Carpenter would have turned into one of our greatest directors but it wasn't a hit it cost a lot of money and it tanked
MCDM-16||there's a danger when you fail to make enough money for the studio that you'll never get a second chance and Carpenter
MCDM-17||knew it so when he got a second chance he didn't waste it he hit another home run just a show he could do it he said
MCDM-18||oh you want nice aliens fine and delivered Starman a better movie than ET in every way except there's a scene in
MCDM-19||ET where they play Dungeons & Dragons that's cool Carpenter described Starman as his apology to Hollywood for the
MCDM-20||thing I'm sorry I scared the out of you please let me keep making movies alas it
MCDM-21||was too late Starman came in number 30 at the box office that here and carpenter never got a third chance
MCDM-22||to be a major director in Hollywood thanks et et is whether he likes it or not the progenitor of the plotline from
MCDM-23||Jeff Nichols as new film Midnight Special same story the only innovation here is
MCDM-24||making the kid from et the alien but Nicholas didn't want to make et he wanted to make star man he talks about
MCDM-25||it in interviews Nichols said he wanted to make a 1980s John Carpenter movie as though 1980s John Carpenter is a genre
MCDM-26||all its own which maybe it is he said he thought star man was a good place to start he started there but having
MCDM-27||watched midnight special he doesn't seem to have gone anywhere with it star man is in always a more interesting
MCDM-28||rewarding movie Midnight Special raises all the same questions a star man and has just as many answers they're just
MCDM-29||not as interesting in fact they're baffling in their lack of imagination midnight special opens on a black screen
MCDM-30||a radio playing and what we learn is a motel room before we see anything we hear a commercial for a Fort Worth
MCDM-31||Nissan dealership so we know we're in Texas visit WWE em so we know it's the modern day but it doesn't look like the
MCDM-32||modern day everyone in this film the way they dress the cars they drive look like the 1970s just kept going given that
MCDM-33||he's basically remaking a movie set 35 years ago maybe that's nickels his point he likes
MCDM-34||stuff from back then so he made his movie looked like something from back then the film looks great like Starman
MCDM-35||Midnight Special spends all its time on the highways and gas stations and back roads of the American South this is
MCDM-36||Nicholas's territory and he makes it look amazing it's beautiful it's just kind of boring with the possible
MCDM-37||exception of atom drivers character and no one in this movie talks or behaves like a normal person we spend the entire
MCDM-38||movie with a young boy Alton and his parents but no one ever says I love you no one has a nickname for Alton no one
MCDM-39||ever calls him champ or a sport or snicklefritz everyone so in awe of him including his parents who should
MCDM-40||remember a time when their kid was more normal before we could hear and decode encrypted radio broadcasts and other
MCDM-41||languages but they all treat him as though there was never time when he was just their son they act like he was
MCDM-42||always an alien it seems like there was never a point when their lives were normal it would have been nice to see a
MCDM-43||hint of a time before the movie started I love the sentiment his father expresses when Alton says you don't have
MCDM-44||to worry about me Michael Shannon says I'll always worry about you that's the deal he never says he loves his son
MCDM-45||but he says he'll always worry about him I like worrying about you he says baby that's nickels this point love means
MCDM-46||spending your life worrying about someone Michael Shannon is amazing to watch act but apart from the look
MCDM-47||worried and desperate he hasn't given anything else to do every scene he's in it is the same you can mix them up watch
MCDM-48||them in any order still make sense I wanted an ark some humanity something they've got Sam Shepard in this movie
MCDM-49||who was a brilliant actor and writer and we see him for like two minutes and that's it
MCDM-50||crazy to waste him like that Adam drivers amused detached curiosity is fun to watch and gosh I wish we'd gotten
MCDM-51||more that now I think I would have liked the movie more if the whole thing had been from his point of view
MCDM-52||probably the narrative wouldn't sustain that too much of a good thing but unlike everyone else in the movie every time he
MCDM-53||is on screen I was happy and entertained and keen to see what happened next he has more in common with Alton than
MCDM-54||anyone else in the picture he finds everyone even the government he works for amusing and they're clueless
MCDM-55||sincerity and earnestness I was intensely interested in Midnight Special when I first heard about it I haven't
MCDM-56||seen Nichols as other work I didn't really know what to expect but the previews completely hooked me and I've
MCDM-57||spent the last two months spreading the gospel I spent two and a half hours in traffic to see it in LA this weekend I
MCDM-58||wanted to believe but I don't think there was much to believe in Starr man has an arc the title character has an
MCDM-59||arc the woman he kidnaps has an arc Jeff Bridges is playing a complex character with a lot going on into the surface
MCDM-60||Karen Allen is playing a complex character with a lot going on under the surface they are each going through the
MCDM-61||same experience but from opposite directions and that makes it interesting every time Jeff Bridges as alien talks
MCDM-62||does anything we learn something amazing we see something amazing the plot advances his mystery expands and
MCDM-63||tantalizes and moves us it's a remarkably fer tiles to crypt each sequence shows us something new and
MCDM-64||unexpected midnight special is basically the same scene repeated for two hours we never really learned anything about
MCDM-65||Alton he does some amazing stuff often using the same special effects with star man but it doesn't move the plot forward
MCDM-66||or teach us anything about his character when the alien in star man finally meets the government scientist who's been
MCDM-67||curious about him the whole time we get an amazing scene it's sentimental and obvious but sometimes that's what a
MCDM-68||movie demands that same scene in Midnight Special has nothing no information no pathos in star man we
MCDM-69||learn something about the aliens and we learn some about ourselves and midnight special we
MCDM-70||just get a white room and a kid who can do tricks when Alton finally tells us what the
MCDM-71||hell is going on it's baffling I don't mean incomprehensible I mean I was baffled this was their answer I don't
MCDM-72||belong here he says yeah we guessed that but and this is important no explanation is given as to why like he is apparently
MCDM-73||Kirsten Dunst and Michael Shannon's biological kid but he's also an alien from another world what there's a
MCDM-74||profound lack of thought put into the explanation for why everything happens in this movie and I got the sense it was
MCDM-75||meant to be more mystical than science fictional but regardless of whether it's science or fantasy the ending needs to
MCDM-76||pay off the rest of the film star man has a great explanation for everything that's happening everything in star man
MCDM-77||makes a logical sense from the opening premise that mankind has been sending messages to aliens which is true by the
MCDM-78||way we have we really made a spaceship and sent it out of the solar system with a message from Earth on it inviting any
MCDM-79||aliens who find it to come visit us I'm not making that up it's real and everything in star man logically follows
MCDM-80||from it nothing in midnight special makes any sense and when we finally get the closing reveal showing us Alton's
MCDM-81||world it's it's pretty disappointing this is apparently the revelatory religious experience everyone's been
MCDM-82||having when they look in Alton's eyes and the only thing I can conclude is they don't have concept artists in Texas
MCDM-83||or Louisiana like go buy an art book guys go look at a yes album cover from the 1970s Google Sid meat or fangs ooh
MCDM-84||come on I felt the pressure Starman exerted on this film jeff nichols said he wanted to make a movie
MCDM-85||like Star Man but he clearly didn't feel he could just remake that film he didn't feel he could just lift that plot he
MCDM-86||needed to make his own version but his versions explanation for everything is so weak as to completely deflate all
MCDM-87||attention leading up to it when your whole movie is the mystery the mystery needs to be damn good if you've got
MCDM-88||great characters and dialogue and we just love spending time with these people
MCDM-89||then we won't notice much if the destination isn't that interesting but if the journey is flat and monotonous
MCDM-90||you really need a hell of a destination to make it all worthwhile and midnight special acts that star man had great
MCDM-91||characters quotable dialogue great journey great destination Midnight Special doesn't great actors movie looks
MCDM-92||beautiful otherwise there's a scene at the end the last shot in fact I'm not going to spoil it
MCDM-93||that's meant to send us out of the theater wondering leave us with a question but after the events in
MCDM-94||Midnight Special I'm not particularly interested in engaging with that question the movie
MCDM-95||didn't give me any reason to believe there might be an interesting answer there it just made me want to go watch
MCDM-96||star man again maybe et that's why I thought of midnight special let me know what you
MCDM-97||thought if you liked this I'll probably do more reviews in the future movie reviews is something I've been doing
MCDM-98||your semi regularly for the last 20 years on that website and now I've got a camera and I set up here and I thought
MCDM-99||I'd make a video if you liked it I'll make more if you didn't like it I'll probably still make more but I will be
MCDM-100||less excited about it until next time peace out 
MCDM-101||Hi everybody, my name is Matt Colville, and as you can see I am a white, middle-class, middle-aged nerd. And if you guessed, "I bet that guy plays D&D,"  you would be correct. This is my channel and it's about running Dungeons & Dragons.
MCDM-102||Here's the pitch: I want to turn you from someone who wants to play D&D into somebody who wants to run D&D. Being a Dungeon Master is fun! It's creative and it's not that hard. But if you don't know how it's done, it seems intimidating. Maybe you've seen Critical Roll.
MCDM-103||*shouts* Or Acquisitions Incorporated "And a Beholder comes through."
MCDM-104||"What!?" "A real one?" "I've got a way bigger one"
MCDM-105||And thought: 'Wow that seems awesome!' But those guys are amazing I could never do that. Well that's nonsense first of all Matt Mercer and Chris Perkins have been running the game for like a million years.
MCDM-106||Do not compare yourself to them. They are craftsman who have honed their art to a fine edge over literally decades. When you start off, you'll be terrible.
MCDM-107||I realise that's not the most encouraging thing to say but the fact is your players will be new and they won't know you're terrible. That's the secret.
MCDM-108||If you play with your friends and none of you have ever played before they will think you are amazing the way everyone thinks Matt and Chris are amazing. And after a while, you will be a great DM.
MCDM-109||And the thing is, it will be fun the entire time. It'll be fun while you're terrible at it, and it'll be fun while you're great at it. So if you're interested in 'running', I'm here to de-mystify it and show you it's easy and awesome.
MCDM-110||Why would I go through the trouble of making a YouTube series just to teach you how to be a good DM? Because I am a river to my people. "The Turks pay me a golden treasure yet I am poor."
MCDM-111||"Because I am a river to my people!" *people shouting and cheering* 
MCDM-112||You are going to run D&D, tonight, for free, with an adventure that you made. -Well, we made -Ok, I made. The principle is the same. What do you need to get started? You need three things: you need some friends, you need the rules, and you need an adventure.
MCDM-113||Friends: I recommend between 3 and 4, you can run for more, I've run for as many as 9, 10, I think 11 I did once,  it was a nightmare, I do not recommend it. You need the rules: you may be tempted to get the three core rulebooks, the Player's Handbook, the Monster Manual, and the Dungeon Master's Guide, but that's a lot of money to spend for your first time out
MCDM-114||And you'll feel like "I have to read all 3 of these books in order to know  what's going on." That is not true. Wizards of the Coast put the basic rules online for free, the contain everything you need and a simple explanation for how everything works. I put a link to the free rules in the blah-blah down below.
MCDM-115||There's also a link down there to a whole bunch of pre-generated characters, which will make you life a lot easier. They're also official, they're from Wizards of the Coast, you print out a whole bunch of them and you put them in front of your friends and let them pick they characters they want to play. Later on, when your friends are hooked and they love playing, you can let them make their own characters, they'll have a lot of fun doing it.
MCDM-116||But making characters in D&D is- -it's something that's fun to do if you already know how to do it, it is not fun to learn, and it's kind of a pain in the butt. We'll go over how to make characters later on, especially from the DM's point of view in another episode.
MCDM-117||So you need some friends (I said between 3 and 4), you need some rules (you can download those for free online), you're also going to get some pre-generated characters for free (that's also in the blah-blah down there), and you need an adventure. We're going to do that right now.
MCDM-118||Back in the 1970s, when the game first came out, the guys who created the game had their own adventures, but they did not include them in the game, because they thought part of the fun was you making your own, so that's what we're gonna do. You can download lots of adventures for free online, and in fact, there are some great classics you can get at dndclassics.com that're still playable.
MCDM-119||You can go out and get the D&D Starter Set, which I think is twenty or thirty bucks and includes this thing, The Lost Mine of Flapdoodle (Flapdoodle? Phandelver. Whatever.) Not the best name in the world, but this adventure is like fifty pages long, and it would take you about 3, 4, maybe 6 weeks to finish this. I think for your first time, it's best to run something that you can finish in one night and that means 3 or 4 hours of play.
MCDM-120||I think in general, players only get through about 5 encounters in one evening, so our adventure is going to have five encounters. Alright, so, what's an encounter? An encounter is anything  that stops the player's forward progress and challenges them. The classic encounter is: a battle. You open the door, and see 5 goblins, roll initiative.
MCDM-121||That's an encounter. But traps are also an encounter, remember Indiana Jones and the Golden Idol? Or the holy grail?
MCDM-122||- kneal! Those are both traps. Puzzles are encounters. Remember Gandalf at the gates of Moria?
MCDM-123||Frodo: What's the elvish word for "Friend?" Gandalf: Mellon That's a classic puzzle.
MCDM-124||Since the classic encounter is a battle, and you're players are going to be first level, we're going to start with goblins. Goblins are easy to run, and they're pretty flexible, meaning: if your players end up walking through it,  and it's too easy, you can always just throw more goblins in, and adding one or two more goblins to an encounter is not the end of the world.
MCDM-125||So our encounters will be fighting some goblins, fighting some more goblins, fighting the boss of the goblins, there'll be a trap in there, and there'll be a puzzle in there, that's five encounters, that's about one evening's worth of adventure, 3 to 4 hours. Since it's in the name of the game, our adventure is gonna be a dungeon, and therefore, we're gonna need a map  of the dungeon.
MCDM-126||Later on you'll have lots of maps. You'll have maps of the world, you'll have maps of the local area, you'll have maps of the town, you'll have maps of the tavern in the town, But for right now, we just need a map of the dungeon. And the easiest way to draw a map is usually just with a pencil and an eraser (you can tell I'm hardcore because I have this cool art eraser),
MCDM-127||And some graph paper, but since watching me draw something on graph paper is not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, we're going to use a program that is free, you can use online, called Dungeonographer. There is a payed version of Dungeonographer, and I recommend you  get it if you like it, if you find it easy and fun to do.
MCDM-128||There is a link to Dungeonographer down in the blah-blah, so if you want, you can try yourself, you can make your own dungeon. I've also included my Dungeonographer file so you can load it in and you can move things around if you want. Remember, this is your dungeon, customize it, make it yours.
MCDM-129||Woah, transition! Ok, this is Dungeonographer, we're going to create a map of our first adventure, and for our first dungeon we don't necessarily need the sexiest dungeon in the world,
MCDM-130||instead we want to make something that's actually pretty simple and straightforward so it doesn't seem intimidating, and seems like it would be easy to run, I assure you, you and your players will still have fun running it. So, I'm imagining this is a tomb of an order of knights, and that the goblins have broken in and taken it over.
MCDM-131||So we're going to start with an entrance, uh, the entrance to the tomb, we'll put a doorway there in a little while. And, uh, we imagine that there'll be a couple of goblin guards at the top of the entrance, uh, so the players have somebody to interact with, uh, and maybe the players will ambush them. And we'll put some stairs down here, you can tell they're stairs down because the wide lines are at the top and the tiny narrow lines are at the bottom.
MCDM-132||Now we want to put something interesting down here for the players to interact with. So, we drop a trap down there. That's that litte square with a T on it.
MCDM-133||And the idea here is that it's a pressure-plate trap The players have just maybe fought the goblin guards, they're sneaking into the dungeon. and if they're not paying attention, they'll step on the trap and trigger a scythe that comes out of the ceiling.
MCDM-134||A giant blade that will slice them up. Like the trap from the Indiana Jones movie, why not? And now we move on to our next room.
MCDM-135||And here, this is a larger room, this is probably where the goblins are sleeping, or hanging out, or making their goblin nest. And we're going to put in this room kind of the history of the order of knights on the walls.
MCDM-136||There'll be carvings on the walls showing the knights fighting Chaos or Evil. You know, maybe even goblins. And we'll put a little brazier there, a little copper bowl,
MCDM-137||that people in times past have, when they come to the tomb of knights to kind of, like you know, put flowers on their grave, they would make an offering in the copper bowl.
MCDM-138||But this is where the goblins will be hanging out. Now we need a room for our boss monster fight and the players will be encouraged to think that this is the last room of the dungeon.
MCDM-139||The room will be dominated by a giant stone statue of the leader of the order of knights, whose tomb this is. So, the players should be impressed by how awesome this guy was in life. So, we grab a statue icon, that's the little five-pointed star there.
MCDM-140||We'll drop it in and we'll put him on a dais. A little raised off the top of the ground, on a stone platform. And we'll drop the platform in. And now, the way dungeonographer works, I'll have to click on that platform.
MCDM-141||Since I put it in there second it's on top and if I click the "send to back" icon it will cause the, uh, statue icon to pop forward.
MCDM-142||So, we're going to put a bugbear boss in here, leading the goblins, and he'll have a couple of goblin buddies. And there'll be a cool fight in here, and the players may think "That's it!"
MCDM-143||But that's not going to be it, we're going to have something secret in here. Remember we like the idea that there's something hidden.
MCDM-144||And we'll put another room in here where the knights are actually buried. And the players should be wondering, like, "Hey, if this is a tomb, where are the knights' sarcophagi?" Well, there in here.
MCDM-145||And we'll drop, like, a large sarcophagus up at the top for the leader of the order of knights. And then we'll put a few smaller ones in here. So, these are the other knights of the order.
MCDM-146||And because this room is meant to be hidden and something the players have to look for to find, we're going to put a little secret door there, which is the S symbol. And now we've got a pretty cool little dungeon.
MCDM-147||Who are the players going to fight if they come in here? Well, if the start interfering with the tomb, with the sarcophagi,
MCDM-148||uh, some undead guys will pop out. So, it's not going to be just goblins, we'll throw some cool undead in there. So this is our map, and we're gonna export it and we'll
MCDM-149||do a cool little non-repro blue, uh, printout so it looks like the old classic - I happen to like the old, the look of the old classic adventures, and now we'll start labelling our map, we have our entranceway
MCDM-150||which will have our goblin, uh, lookouts, we have our trap, and we'll make it so that that trap, uh, the pressure plate trap is something that if you're light enough, if you're a goblin, for instance, or a halfling,
MCDM-151||you don't trip the trap, and that's how the goblins are able to get in and out, without getting 'scythed' to death.
MCDM-152||And we mark everything else, we mark our ending there, And we start writing our notes directly on the map - why not, I'll often do this in pencil - So we have our goblin lookouts, at the front, we have our pressure
MCDM-153||plate trap, where if you're light enough you don't trigger it, and often, the thief in the party is a halfling, so he may be able to pass and he has no idea there's a trap there.
MCDM-154||We have our offering room, with a brazier, which allows uh, normal people to come and make sacrifices and this will be our goblin bivouac, where the goblins live and sleep and have their collective being, And on the walls, are carvings of the knights fighting, so the players are reminded this is
MCDM-155||a tomb of an order of knights. And we're also going to have, written on the wall opposite the knights, the oath that the knights took in order to become members of their order - that's gonna be important
MCDM-156||later, because we also said we wanted a puzzle in here, and that's going to be part of the fun of room number four, not only is there a goblin boss, with his buddies,
MCDM-157||we have a statue of the leader of the order of knights, and I happen to like the idea that it's an ancient, kind of Roman-esque uh, order, and so his name is Sextus Varnus, and there's uh, a riddle,
MCDM-158||printed, uh, on the daius, that the players can read, and if they're smart, they will figure out the riddle and that will cause the door to open, but a thief can open it, and find the hidden room with the undead in,
MCDM-159||are the undead skeletons? Are they ghouls? You know, maybe that's up to you! And, ultimately, we want some cool treasure that the players find,
MCDM-160||in the sixth room, in the sarcophagus, so they get a cool magic sword. And we want our dungeon to be dynamic, so we create a
MCDM-161||patrol of goblins, that goes all around the mausoleum and out into the forest about every, let's say four hours, and so if the players stay outside, and watch to see what's going on with this mausoleum,
MCDM-162||they'll see the guards outside the front door, but eventually they'll see the goblin patrol, if they're impatient and just go right up to the front door they'll miss the goblin patrol,
MCDM-163||so later, while they're in room three,  fighting the goblins in there, the patrol will find them and come up behind them, and now they're fighting on two fronts.
MCDM-164||and the guys who were in the back of the party who thought they were safe, find themselves in trouble. and that makes it fun, and makes it seem like the goblins are clever and smart, and that's always a good idea.
MCDM-165||And we said we wanted a puzzle, so we'll create a riddle, that'll be inscribed on the pedestal on the statue in room four, this is something I just made up,
MCDM-166||"If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me." And the answer is: your word! If you're going to keep your word to somebody you have to first give them your word.
MCDM-167||"I give you my word." I think an order of knights would really like that. So we're gonna create an oath, that the players, if they speak the oath and give their word to the statue in room four,
MCDM-168||will unlock the secret door. So, what is that oath? We'll create "The Oath of the Delian Order" that's the name of the order of knights,
MCDM-169||And it'll be in room three, on the one wall is the, uh, stone carvings of knights fighting bad guys, and on the other side is the oath.
MCDM-170||"I swear to serve law, battle, chaos, and strive to keep the lore of the Delian Order secret." So the players read this in room three, and wonder what it's about, and if they solve the riddle in room four - even if they don't solve the riddle, they may just speak the oath -
MCDM-171||and the statue will unlock, uh, the secret door, and that's it, they'll get to fight the bad guys, they'll get the magic sword, and that is our first adventure, with a map and everything! Not bad!
MCDM-172||Okay, so we just made our first adventure, except... not really. What we have is a pretty good outline, and a lot of nice detail, we have a map, we have an idea of what's gonna happen in each room,
MCDM-173||But what we're missing for this is the context, we're missing the setup. We wanna know: how did the players find out about this? And why did they go to the tomb in the first place? Also, something else that I realised as I was getting this part of the video ready,
MCDM-174||is that after I'd done everything else, I'd kinda screwed the map up a little bit - I put a trap before the offering room, and the whole idea of the offering room is that this is where people would come, back in the day where the memory of these knight was still recent,
MCDM-175||people would come and make an offering to this order of knights, like, you know, "please bless us and look after us." And it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, to do that, uh, after you get your head cut off by a scythe trap.
MCDM-176||Now, this is entirely typical DM stuff, you'll have an adventure ready, you'll even run and you feel like you understand it, it may be one you created it may be one you downloaded but as you're running it your players start to notice stuff that you hadn't thought of and you're like "oh,
MCDM-177||yeah, that doesn't make any sense, I need to do some fancy footwork here to explain all this." So the next time you run it for the next group of players, you've fixed it, you've tweaked it a little bit, and over time, the adventures that you run - whether they're ones that you've made up yourself or they're ones
MCDM-178||you downloaded or bought, they get better, you get better running them, you make little notes, you remember stuff from last time.
MCDM-179||So what I did was, I just went and rearranged two of the rooms, you can see the map here. and you can see that I just moved the offering room up one square and put
MCDM-180||the trap after. then I rearranged the text so the numbers make sense. And that's exactly the same kind of stuff you're gonna do as a DM.
MCDM-181||So our next episode and the last of this opening series, we're gonna talk about setting up the adventure, explaining it to the players, getting them hooked, giving them a reason to do all this stuff
MCDM-182||and getting into a little bit more detail about how to run it what kind of things are going to happen as you run this adventure? That's it for Episode Two.
MCDM-183||Peace... Out. 
MCDM-184||You've tracked the Goblin raiders to their hideout, a tomb that sits atop a hill. Within lies a host of monsters and the girl they kidnapped to use in their fell ritual. If you hurry, she may still be alive. That is a great way to start your first adventure just pow!
MCDM-185||Drop the players off in front of the dungeon describe the entrance and tell them the stakes goblins and treasure inside just find the girl. Just find the girl. Clear motivation, maybe the simplest most straightforward way to get started certainly the most old-school way to get started
MCDM-186||But is it the best way to get started well? That's up to you, but it's certainly not the only way to get started this episode We're going to talk about maybe the hardest thing to do in dungeons & Dragons and that is
MCDM-187||Getting started going from having everybody sitting at the table And you have an adventure ready to actually playing. That transition is always a huge pain in the butt for me I get nervous I get anxiety
MCDM-188||Once we're playing no problem I can run for hours But getting over that first hump going from just a bunch of people sitting around a table to playing D&D is for me the hardest thing to do.
MCDM-189||Back in the day the DM often began an adventure by dropping the players in front of the dungeon and describing the Entrance that's because a lot of adventures began as modules used at conventions in tournament play That's right competitive D&D which I have done and which is a lot of fun. Also in the 1970s people wanted to play D&D
MCDM-190||Specifically they want to explore the dungeon. They want to kill monsters and get loot and level up They weren't really worried about narrative a question like what's my motivation would have seemed strange to Gary Gygax in 1974. He would have said "To get treasure!"
MCDM-191||That's also a result of the fantasy literature that influenced dungeons & Dragons. Gary Gygax wasn't a huge fan of Lord of the rings He didn't assume that you began the adventure with the talisman that you needed to destroy To save the world because it was the right thing to do
MCDM-192||He assumed you were more like Conan and would happily scale the tower of the elephant because there was treasure inside also because no one Had ever done it before. Nowadays We sort of assume that the players have a clearer motivation for why they're going on an adventure
MCDM-193||Sometimes even a personal stake in what's happening. I say all this to you to give you a historical context a lot of D&D is Tradition passed on from one group of players to the next also
MCDM-194||Because there isn't one right way to do it the way They did it back in 1974 still works And is still a lot of fun is arguably the simplest most straightforward way to start
MCDM-195||But there are other ways to do it. Dusk falls and five travelers come to the Green Dragon Inn for food Warmth and a place to rest Several Villagers are here eating drinking talking about their day. One day is much the same as another in the hamlet of Villane
MCDM-196||But looking at you something tells these villagers today will be different. Start in a tavern, great beginning I often see players online disparaging well every cliche, including that one, but if you're new to this game There are no cliches. Plus
MCDM-197||maybe your players saw the Fellowship of the Ring and remember Aragorn meeting the hobbits at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. That fellow has done nothing but stare at us since we arrived. Excuse me.
MCDM-198||That man in the corner, who is he? His one of them rangers. Dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is I've never heard but round hear he's known as Strider.
MCDM-199||Strider. Great scene. Players, especially new players, enjoy recognizing scenarios from books or comics or movies that they've seen they've seen the movie, but they haven't played it
MCDM-200||This is their opportunity to do the kinds of things they saw in the movies meet the mysterious stranger in the inn Be the mysterious stranger in the inn. Always feel free to rip stuff off This is your campaign put the stuff you like in it
MCDM-201||Starting in a tavern does two useful things one it gives the players the opportunity to roleplay Their characters meeting each other for the first time players like establishing the relationships in the group I'm not gonna lie to you though this can also be awkward uh
MCDM-202||Hello. I mean, my I say, my character sa- Gork, Gork says Hello That's gonna happen. New playersa aren't used to role-playing and haven't used those muscles yet
MCDM-203||So it can be goofy, it can also be frustrating. The mysterious stranger in the corner ignores you Okay, well fine one of the reasons. We do this is because it's fun to do dramatic stuff like that
MCDM-204||But if Gork's player sticks to his guns then he's not going to go on the adventure One of the things I like to do is go around the table and ask each player to describe their character I mean, we maybe already know that you're playing Gork the barbarian
MCDM-205||But what does gork look like? How does he act? How does he seem? If you ask your players, "Okay everybody we're gonna go around the table and everybody introduce your character tell us what you're playing and what your character looks like and how he Behaves." That might be the first time the player has ever really thought about that. Plus
MCDM-206||we always form impressions about people before they even open their mouths just by looking at them. It also acts as a safe halfway point between their character being a bunch of stats on a page and actually role-playing them. So while it can be goofy and awkward starting in a tavern is also fun plus
MCDM-207||It gives the players the opportunity to roleplay their characters and answer the question, "Wait, how do we know each other?" Also number two, they want to know why are we on this adventure? You can just tell them goblins kidnapped a girl and you've tracked them to their hideout. That's fine
MCDM-208||but some players want to experience that they don't just want to be told it, Which do you think would be more fun? In the tavern we have some NPCs to talk to, the innkeep and her husband, their daughter the serving girl, a merchant carter from another
MCDM-209||town. Some may be friendly some may challenge the players but the goal here is to break the ice. Get your players into character by giving them NPCs to talk to and interact with since they may feel awkward talking to each other.
MCDM-210||Classically the easy way to start is to have the serving girl, and it could be a serving boy, we'll talk about stereotypes in another episode yes we will,
MCDM-211||come up and just ask the character what they want to drink, if they're hungry. Depending on what's happened before this may be the first time the player has ever been asked a direct question by another character and they're going to have to come up with an answer.
MCDM-212||Maybe a stupid answer it may be silly it may be dramatic, but in that moment they are role-playing and now you're all playing D&D. But what is there to order? we're in a tavern so we need a menu. Wow! we need people to talk to, and a menu to order from, and all of
MCDM-213||a sudden you're starting to understand why back in the day people said "Screw it, let's just start in front of the tomb." You can make all that stuff up or I can do it for you Which I just did.
MCDM-214||There are tools online for all this stuff including random NPCs, random Taverns, random menus, you are not the first person to need solutions to these problems. People have been doing this for 40 years and they put all their answers up online to save you a lot of work. At some point, after the innkeep has served food and drinks and the players have gotten to know each other and the NPCs,
MCDM-215||something has to happen. A large man wearing a black leather apron over linen shirt and woolen pants bursts in the door He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer "The got Bes,"
MCDM-216||He says, "they got my girl." Goblins have kidnapped the blacksmith's daughter Well now we've got an adventure your players aren't dumb they sat down at the table wanting an adventure And you just put one in front of them if it occurs to them the players may just ask the blacksmith
MCDM-217||What happened give them the opportunity to do that literally ask them okay? What do you do? I think about 50% of the DM's job is just describing what happens and then asking the players of what they do the other 50% is,
MCDM-218||it's complex but there's pizza in there somewhere. Now not all players are motivated by a sense of justice and duty in fact I think you're just starting out most players are motivated by
MCDM-219||Let's call it a enlightened self-interest which is to say greed. In our lives we're expected to do the right thing there are tons of social pressures on us every day. We have show up on time We have to be polite
MCDM-220||We have to be respectful One of the reasons people enjoy playing D&D is it gives them an opportunity to throw all that out and say "Hey? Why should I help that guy? What's in it for me?"
MCDM-221||And there are lots of examples of classic cool characters saying exactly that. "When they come to get me Rick, I hope you'll be more of a help." "I stick my neck out for nobody" "I'm not going anywhere."
MCDM-222||"They're gonna execute her. Look a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured now All you want to do is stay?" "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind." "But they're gonna kill her!" "Better her than me." Look your players aren't dumb
MCDM-223||They know when the blacksmith walked in the door and saying Goblins kidnapped my daughter that that was the adventure showing up, and they might go whoohoo Let's go or they might want a little more motivation, a little bit more convincing.
MCDM-224||Okay so here you go. Yeah! A wanted poster. The Invincible Overlord, really it's the local Baron the Invincible Overlord doesn't care about a bunch of goblins, is trying to clean up the area you can literally print this out and put it in front of your players to read. A prop like this does a great job of motivating the players
MCDM-225||one silver piece per Goblin and giving them some sense of the politics of the wider world who is the Baron who is the Invincible Overlord and making the world Beyond the tavern seem exotic and dangerous
MCDM-226||Ogres, Giants, snake men! If all else fails you can always just have the blacksmith ask the players directly Will you help find my daughter or another trick I've used is to have somebody who is obviously Unqualified like an old man or a young girl volunteer this often helps motivate the players.
MCDM-227||So we met in a tavern, we talked to each other, we talked to the locals, we looked at the wanted poster, and then a Blacksmith's showed up and gave us our motivation. Time to head to the tomb. So where is this place and how do you get there? players like maps. Fact of life, and a lot of DMs like making maps
MCDM-228||it's part of the fun of the game and There are lots of tools for making all sorts of different maps, and we're going to talk about all of them in upcoming episodes but for now
MCDM-229||I'm gonna quote Alfred Korzybski the guy who invented Semantics and say "The map is not the territory." I use maps all the time, but not only do you not need a map I'm gonna argue that there are good reasons not to use a map
MCDM-230||We live in a time where it's trivially easy for people to whip their phone out and get directions from anywhere to anywhere You have a basic understanding of the shape of the earth and the country that you live in and the local area But that was not true for most of human history if you were a medieval peasant it was very easy to live your entire life
MCDM-231||Without ever going more than a few miles outside of town. Maybe you'd visited one or two towns nearby, maybe you'd seen a map of the world in church, or in one of the few books you had ever seen, but that was unusual. It can therefore be more immersive for you to say 2 miles to the North lies the
MCDM-232||Boar forest and beyond that the tomb on the hill. That is how people thought in the middle ages and not only does it save you work It makes the world feel more dangerous and more mysterious. Show the players a map and they feel like they understand something. Describe it using language and landmarks, and it feels like the world is a large mysterious place
MCDM-233||which it should. So without a map showing us how to get there, How do we find the tomb? Easy the goblins left tracks. It may occur to the players to go to the Smith's house and look for tracks if they do that they get to feel like detectives
MCDM-234||and that's part of the fun. If they never think of that have an NPC suggest it. That's what NPCs are for. The goblins left tracks that are easy to follow they go north to the boar wood. It may occur to the players to ask the
MCDM-235||locals, "Hey, what's in the forest?" The locals will say "Nothing, boars. It's in the name of the forest we hunt there all the time There's no goblins."
MCDM-236||So the goblins must be somewhere beyond the forest however big the forest is it's not something the players can get through in one day They're gonna have to spend the night there we put the forest between the tomb and the tavern because we want the players to have To spend the night we want the players to have to take watch in the middle of the forest and be wary
MCDM-237||Wondering if something's going to attack them in the middle of the night why because it makes the world feel more mysterious And it makes the players feel like they're on an adventure like anything might happen any Time the players stop and rest outside of town. I have them roll for a random encounter. We'll do a whole episode later
MCDM-238||maybe more than one on random encounters, but the goal here is to make the world feel dangerous. If the players feel like they can stop and rest any time they're wounded or low on spells
MCDM-239||then they will do so and that will grind everything to a halt. Players naturally want to avoid risk your job is to make everything outside of town seem Risky the world is a dangerous place But for this episode. I'm gonna roll some dice behind the screen and tell the players the evening passes uneventful.
MCDM-240||I mean you can do what you want. You can throw an ogre at them or maybe a pack of dire boars It is after all in the name of the forest but our goal here is for the players to finish something tonight. And that means we want to get him to the tomb as quickly as possible.
MCDM-241||Once outside the forest after an hour two of travel the players will see the tomb on top of a hill I like to use old roman ruins for things like this because it communicates to the players this belongs to an ancient civilization. At this point the players may want to hang back and watch the tomb for a while,
MCDM-242||See if there's any Goblin activity, that's a good idea let them do that. Remember we put a goblin patrol around the tomb on purpose in case they did that so the players started in a tavern, they met each other, they met the local NPCs, they met the Blacksmith,
MCDM-243||they found out his daughter had been kidnapped by Goblins, they followed the Goblin tracks through the forest, they spent the night and the next morning they showed up at the tomb. Now they're sitting and watching waiting to see what happens.
MCDM-244||We'll talk about running the tomb about how many goblins to use and about what kinds of things are going to happen inside the dungeon Next week. Peace out. 
MCDM-245||okay let's talk about NPCs everybody matt covert here i set up an idea in former page which there's a link to in
MCDM-246||the doobly-doo so that folks who wanted to could let me know what kinds of videos they want to see and you get to
MCDM-247||vote on different people's ideas and the ones with the most votes rise to the top and the number one video people wanted
MCDM-248||to see was on NPCs but I'm not I'm not 100% sure how to boil down everything I know about how to run NPCs into one
MCDM-249||video so this may be the kind of thing where there's a whole bunch of questions in the comments and there'll be another
MCDM-250||video maybe this isn't the NPC video maybe this is just a and peasy video and there'll be another one later where I
MCDM-251||answer people's questions I started by going on a twitch and saying alright folks what is there about running an NPC
MCDM-252||that you feel like you need help with I got a lot of answers but by far the number one answer the most common answer
MCDM-253||was people who were looking for advice on how to make their NPCs memorable and I was like okay memorable now I was
MCDM-254||somewhat suspicious of that and you'll see why so I think the next day I said name a memorable NPC again I got a lot
MCDM-255||of answers but probably around 80 to 90 percent of them were examples from critical role specifically two
MCDM-256||characters on a whole bunch of people named two specific characters from critical role so if you're not familiar
MCDM-257||with Matt Mercer's D&D game that is on twitch every Thursday night I'll put a link in the doobly-doo
MCDM-258||I sort of presume everyone who watches this is but I am occasionally reminded that there are some few people out there
MCDM-259||who got to this channel via other means one of the two NPCs that was brought up often was Gilmour and I thought okay I
MCDM-260||think I understand I know who Gilmour is I think I understand what makes that character memorable we'll talk about
MCDM-261||that in a second but the next character that people referenced the next NPC people talked about as being memorable
MCDM-262||was a character I had not heard of before because I don't watch every episode of critical role it's like four
MCDM-263||hours a week holy crap and that was Victor the black-powder merchant I didn't watch the episodes he was in or I
MCDM-264||didn't watch that part I watched about 45 minutes to an hour and a half of most episodes of critical role and it's
MCDM-265||astonishing how much time I spend in my week watching that show but how little of that show I have seen I felt like I
MCDM-266||understood what made Gilmore a memorable NPC but I didn't know who Victor was so I went and looked him up I thought who
MCDM-267||is this Victor guy and what makes them memorable yes oh you mean back powers coming coming he runs back into the hub
MCDM-268||okay yeah I get it obviously it's clear what makes that NPC memorable in both instances Gilmore and Victor the black
MCDM-269||powder merchant Matt made these NPCs memorable I giving them crazy voices or making
MCDM-270||them really overtly flamboyant characters I mean Gilmore is a very flamboyant character he's described in
MCDM-271||the critical role wiki as having a broadway personality which is a euphemism I had not encountered before
MCDM-272||but it worked I mean I knew what they meant as soon as I said it Gilmore speaks flamboyantly he dresses
MCDM-273||flamboyantly he comes on two backs I think people when they see folks like the players and Matt I'm critical role
MCDM-274||they think that there must be some trick there must be some way something like a checkbox they could check off and if
MCDM-275||they do this if they follow these instructions then they will have a memorable character or memorable NPC but
MCDM-276||really I think the trick for doing outrageous personalities which is what makes Gilmore and Viktor the
MCDM-277||black-powder merchant memorable or doing great accents is just being there's no trick to it you just have to be willing
MCDM-278||to look like an idiot not only do you have to be willing to look like an idiot you have to be willing to look like an
MCDM-279||idiot a lot because eventually you won't look like like those guys the folks on critical role do not look like idiots
MCDM-280||they look like pros they literally are pros they were not born that way they had to work at that you know often for
MCDM-281||years and in fact I think most of them would say they're always working at it it's not it's never a solved problem I
MCDM-282||saw a video of someone this was incredibly flattering and also just really inspiring for me as a YouTube
MCDM-283||creator someone online who was doing my Dragonborn accent whenever I play a Dragonborn either as a player or in my
MCDM-284||campaign as a DM I look at those guys as skull and the shape of the heads and I'm like there is no way these folks would
MCDM-285||talk like normal people they would have trouble forming words right they don't really have lips they have like forked
MCDM-286||tongues and stuff so I always play them with these crazy accents and whether or not my players like it it is memorable
MCDM-287||one somebody said it sounded like Bill Nye he's character Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean that's fine
MCDM-288||that works for me you notice that wasn't really an accent that was more of a mannerism I just did this crazy thing
MCDM-289||with my voice and called it good and I think it was flamboyant enough that it made it somewhat easy to copy so if
MCDM-290||you're looking for a trick as to how to make an npc memorable unfortunately there really isn't one other than just
MCDM-291||going for it you just have to go for it some of your friends are going to laugh some of them are going to think that
MCDM-292||it's ridiculous it might turn some of them off but that's because you're completely new at this years from now
MCDM-293||after you've been doing this for a while you'll be super confident and your friends will be really impressed if you
MCDM-294||want to make an outrageous character if you want to make it in peace either your players are going to remember and you
MCDM-295||want to go for an accent or something like that look I'm not a dialogue coach but I can tell you a couple of tricks
MCDM-296||that I've learned over the years first of all performing an npc in a memorable way does not rely on an accent you heard
MCDM-297||my Dragonborn voice is that an accent I don't think so I think it's just a crazy way of talking maybe what's the
MCDM-298||difference we're not an accent I don't know but I often give NPCs tics or ways of speaking of phrases they deploy or
MCDM-299||I'll change my voice up I'll go into a higher or a lower register or there'll be some words I avoid using you know
MCDM-300||like data doesn't use contractions for instance and I think there he screwed that up a couple times but that you get
MCDM-301||the point you know I'm the lead rider at Turtle Rock Studios I wrote 98% of the dialogue for evolve and when I'm writing
MCDM-302||a character like Abe who Matt mercer played when I'm writing a character like Abe or Hyde these are characters that
MCDM-303||deploy a lot of profanity that's just their natural language but when I write a character like Cabot that dude never
MCDM-304||swears Cabot doesn't swear for the same reasons that Abe and Hyde do it's how he was raised but it also says a lot about
MCDM-305||him as a person as leader so the choices you make in the words you deploy whether or not you swear has a huge impact on
MCDM-306||how your player is going to perceive the character so it's not all about accents and funny voices I really want to break
MCDM-307||the back of that idea because again if you watch a critical role you're gonna think oh playing D&D means doing accents
MCDM-308||it means getting into character now that's one way to do it and it's a lot of fun I am typically the most
MCDM-309||actively the most theatrical character at any given table I'm at so obviously I like doing that stuff but the people I
MCDM-310||like playing with the most the best DMS I've ever played with my one of my favorite all-time favorite DMS never did
MCDM-311||any voices he never role played in character he would always describe what the PC NPCs were doing in third-person
MCDM-312||that is perfectly legitimate I am giving you permission to be you can be a perfectly good DM and your players will
MCDM-313||love playing with you and you never speak in character once you just describe what the NPCs are doing or what
MCDM-314||they're saying in an otherwise neutral way you can say the NPC gets angry but that doesn't mean you have to shout so
MCDM-315||consider if you're going to role play the character if you're going to try and get in character it doesn't have to be
MCDM-316||about accents we'll talk about accents in a second but I don't want that to be the overwhelming like you know Gilmour
MCDM-317||doesn't really have an accent he has a flamboyant Broadway personality but is that an accent right I'd still love
MCDM-318||broadway personality as aces one of the things i do as a writer I also do this as a DM but I learned
MCDM-319||this stuff as a I cut my teeth on this as a writer and I did in texts for years and eventually I was able to do it in my
MCDM-320||normal speech is I deploy Latin or anglo-saxon Old English Old English words or Latin words depending on
MCDM-321||whether or not this is an intelligent well-read character or not intelligent well-read characters often use in the
MCDM-322||real world often use Latin eight world they'll say planet where as somebody who's a you know a down-to-earth
MCDM-323||salt-of-the-earth uneducated person would say world that has a big impact on how my NPCs are perceived the players
MCDM-324||can tell this guy's smart based on not what he says but how he says it when they need a farmer when they need a
MCDM-325||peasant that peasant might say the same things that an educated the wizard from the tower might say but he'll say in a
MCDM-326||completely different way he'll choose different words to use now that is advice I don't know if it's a good
MCDM-327||advice because it's super esoteric it's the kind of thing you really have to work at for years but the good thing
MCDM-328||about running Dungeons and Dragons and basically having D&D as a hobby is that the stuff that you start trying now is
MCDM-329||gonna pay off for years you know I have no problem I was talking to my friends at work I bought a brand new a big huge
MCDM-330||tool chest to store all my stuff in and more than one person commented on how expensive this thing was and I was like
MCDM-331||look this thing I'm gonna be using this in in many cases every week for the rest of my life so don't be afraid to try
MCDM-332||accents also let's talk about accents don't be afraid to try accents don't be afraid to try stuff like choosing
MCDM-333||different words in your speech because even though you're gonna suck at it now eventually you will be pretty good at it
MCDM-334||all right so accents look the best way I think to learn accents is to have a really long drive so if you don't if you
MCDM-335||live close to work or school move because if you've got about a half an hour long drive I think more than that
MCDM-336||will be taxing on the head meats if you got that half an hour long drive you can listen to audiobooks and you can listen
MCDM-337||to NPR NPR is a great source I mean I listen to NPR because I'd like to know what's going on but I listen to NPR
MCDM-338||often they are interviewing people from other countries and you get or other parts of America and you get to hear all
MCDM-339||these great accents and I'm alone in the car driving along and I will parrot the accent back and not only the tone of
MCDM-340||their voice and where they put the accents and stuff like that but also stuff like word shorts again word choice
MCDM-341||is huge so have a half-hour long drive listen to NPR practice the accents and not don't just listen and don't just
MCDM-342||pare it back the inflections in their voice but also notice the words they shoes I'm actually
MCDM-343||kind of opposed I mean I in as far as this is a philosophical issue but I'm kind of I always find it weird when
MCDM-344||people are playing Dungeons & Dragons and they start putting on English accents unless your game unless you're
MCDM-345||playing a Robin Hood game or King Arthur game or my friend Jim's game which was set in Albion which was fantastic unless
MCDM-346||you're playing a game set in England why does your character have an English accent you know one of the brilliant
MCDM-347||casting choices of all time I think in my personal opinion is casting Richard Boone as Smaug but there's a lot of
MCDM-348||crazy accents in the rankin/bass Hobbit and you know it's funny looking back I remember thinking that Hobbit movie the
MCDM-349||animated Hobbit was kind of cheesy but compared to the train wreck that was Peter Jackson's version Wow
MCDM-350||the animated Hobbit is now is grown in my estimation but Richard Boone's Smaug is amazing listen to the way this dude
MCDM-351||talks well see I smell you feel your air and I hear your breath come along help yourself
MCDM-352||there's plenty and spare right that is not that dude is not that's the way that guy talks he's not putting on an accent
MCDM-353||he's just Richard Boone he's a great huge fact he was famous before maybe he's not famous for being Smaug but he
MCDM-354||was famous or well-known for often being the heavy the bad guy in westerns he's just doing his normal voice that's just
MCDM-355||how he talks but it's super memorable so I'm a huge critic of that fake British accent that's why a lot of characters of
MCDM-356||my novels speak like modern humans because that's how it would have felt if you were in a medieval era you would if
MCDM-357||you were born and raised in the eleven 30s the people around you spoke from your point of view contemporary English
MCDM-358||and we speak contemporary English so so don't feel pressure to do a British accent it's kind of ridiculous feel free
MCDM-359||to speak in your normal voice feel free to affect other American accents here's one secret uh when you first do
MCDM-360||something crazy when you first do a flamboyant character at first your players first impression is going to be
MCDM-361||that's crazy what is our DM doing but only after 30 seconds 45 seconds a minute it will stop
MCDM-362||being this crazy thing you're doing and it will just become who this character is you just got to stick to your guns
MCDM-363||another thing that's great about having a half-hour long drive is listening to audiobooks I listen to a lot of the
MCDM-364||Terry Pratchett books read by Stephen Briggs if you can find those I strongly recommend reading them
MCDM-365||a because terry pratchet is a genius and B because Stephen Briggs I mean there are so many characters in Terry
MCDM-366||Pratchett novels I really do not envy the narrator of them because he's got to find a way to make all of these
MCDM-367||characters this huge cast all sound distinct so he gives all these different characters different accents in order to
MCDM-368||differentiate them and I'll be driving along in my car and I'll just be parroting back Stephen Briggs his
MCDM-369||versions of these accents one of the things I love about Stephen Briggs his choices as a narrator is it he makes all
MCDM-370||the doors well at least I think it's a Welsh accent what do I know so that's the first I always try to make sure that
MCDM-371||the first and best advice is upfront I think people when they watch critical role they are inspired by the NPC's Matt
MCDM-372||creates and they want to know how does he do it and the most memorable characters he has created are not
MCDM-373||Gilmore is a pretty sophisticated dude but there is a the first impression he gives is very strong and that's because
MCDM-374||matt has made these characters deliberately outrageous flamboyant characters and there's no trick to that
MCDM-375||you just have to be willing to look like a jackass for a little while Matt does not look like a jackass when he does it
MCDM-376||because he's been doing this for decades well not decades I don't know a long time you get the point but this is now I
MCDM-377||think where we get to the meat of this video and that is I I question the desire to make memorable NPCs I question
MCDM-378||it I'm not saying it's a bad idea I'm just saying think about what you're asking why should n P C's be memorable
MCDM-379||what is the purpose of NPCs I as a DM I do not sit around thinking how am I going to make this NPC memorable that is
MCDM-380||honestly something I have really never worried about I worry about how to make bad guys memorable we did a whole video
MCDM-381||on that but when I'm making NPCs for the characters to meet really my goal is to make them plausible it's to give the
MCDM-382||players opportunities to see how they are perceived by the world around them and give them characters to react to and
MCDM-383||interact with it's that moment where other characters treat the players like a hero that makes them feel heroic so my
MCDM-384||NPCs are typically there to either show the players how they are perceived in a positive or negative light when my
MCDM-385||players start off at first level the people that they meet are often suspicious of them because they are
MCDM-386||itinerant adventurers and trouble follows them the town's folk are typically happy being town's folk and
MCDM-387||it's only once these adventures show up that all of a sudden their problems with goblins and stuff like that later on
MCDM-388||once they've saved the town the people are grateful to them and seeing that both instances the goal of the NPC is to
MCDM-389||show the players how they are perceived first with suspicion but then later with gratitude and that transition from
MCDM-390||suspicion to gratitude is really rewarding I've seen it pay off with dozens of players they love that feeling
MCDM-391||of having once been treated badly by these NPCs or at least with suspicion sometimes with open contempt because of
MCDM-392||the reputation that adventurers have they love that feeling of having saved the blacksmith daughter and coming back
MCDM-393||and now these people are super grateful to them that is a very rewarding experience is it memorable does it make
MCDM-394||the NPC's memorable I don't think so they remember that experience though they remember that feeling and it makes
MCDM-395||them feel like heroes so my goal with NPCs is to kind of show the players either how they are perceived or how
MCDM-396||different elements of the world are perceived often my players will read something I've written in some
MCDM-397||background for my campaign and they don't know exactly how it works they can't imagine it but once they meet the
MCDM-398||NPC's then they start understanding how this stuff works like for instance they read the one sheet I hand out and they
MCDM-399||think the invincible overlord must be some tyrannical evil entity that everyone's terrified of but then once
MCDM-400||they start playing they realize oh no they meet people and the people are like well be invincible overlord is not we've
MCDM-401||never seen him we don't know anything about him they have local problems each NPC they meet is an opportunity for me
MCDM-402||to kind of convey a point of view what do people think of the Baron what do people think of the invincible overlord
MCDM-403||what do people think of the Dragon Knights I do not worry about backgrounds in fact I am strongly opposed to them on
MCDM-404||more than one video game project I've worked on artists people have come to me and asked me for long extensive
MCDM-405||backgrounds I don't know why they literally asked for stuff like what is this character's blood type but for
MCDM-406||whatever reason people want extensive backstories and I find that to be a huge red herring you know there's a great Q&A
MCDM-407||with Aaron Sorkin on reddit Aaron Sorkin I think one of the great writers over the last 25 years and he said he
MCDM-408||explained he's like look a character is born when they walk on stage and they die once they walk off stage they have
MCDM-409||no background before that they have no existence after that now that is an extreme viewpoint but this is very
MCDM-410||useful when running I think a lot of people feel this pressure as DMS that they need to know the history of these
MCDM-411||characters no that's not true what they do need to know what is useful is what is this character's motivation and what
MCDM-412||is their personality now both of these things can be informed by their backstory but in my experience that just
MCDM-413||comes out actually as you play them it's not something you have to have worked out
MCDM-414||ahead of time so do not feel like you have to sit down with every NPC and ride out this long backstory that's
MCDM-415||ridiculous motivation and personality what does this character want and then how do they
MCDM-416||express themselves you know when they meet a guard what is a guard want a guard wants to make it home that day
MCDM-417||alive and meet his family he doesn't have to arrest anyway he doesn't have to get in a fight this one
MCDM-418||have to use his weapon and that makes him suspicious when the adventurers show up he's like oh Christ not these guys
MCDM-419||because adventurers are often bristling with weapons and they are they look different than normal people and so
MCDM-420||they're there to make the guards life difficult a town guard is going to often be suspicious of adventures and consider
MCDM-421||them this incredible annoyance you know what is the innkeep want the innkeep wants to provide first family the
MCDM-422||innkeep wants to serve food the innkeep wants to make some money it doesn't take a lot of work or even really a lot of
MCDM-423||thought to figure out what does this NPC want then the only question is what is their personality you know what they
MCDM-424||want now how do they express themselves you know peasants tend to express themselves simply and directly bards
MCDM-425||tend to be flamboyant noblemen tend to use a lot of flowery language they've been educated there are a million
MCDM-426||different kinds of mannerisms for you to choose from and I think less is more pull it back you don't have to be
MCDM-427||flamboyant you don't need to be memorable you're just trying to sell the idea that this is a real person and the
MCDM-428||real people you and I both know are typically not incredible flamboyant personalities I mean I think I have a
MCDM-429||reputation for being a really high energy this is this is the me for the video the me in real life is not like
MCDM-430||this this is my YouTube personality a mannerism can be something simple like he picks his teeth while he talks a
MCDM-431||mannerism can be something simple like he doesn't look you in the eye why doesn't this character look you in the
MCDM-432||eye is it because they are suspicious is because they're afraid of you maybe it's just because that's how they are so
MCDM-433||motivation personality what does this NPC want how do they express themselves I think the number one question I ask
MCDM-434||myself when I'm running a NPC is how does this NPC perceive the heroes if heroes occupy this weird class where
MCDM-435||they're not exactly noblemen but they're also better than peasants how where does this NPC
MCDM-436||fit in this is this NPC a peasant is the normal town's person and do they look up to the heroes and looking up to them
MCDM-437||does that mean that they're afraid of them that they admire them or do they consider the heroes unequal are they
MCDM-438||another adventurer or maybe a member of the Thieves Guild or are they a nobleman looking down on the heroes that is a lot
MCDM-439||to do with how I run an NPC I think about how do they perceive the heroes because I think I think that's the most
MCDM-440||important thing is showing the players themselves and then they worry about stuff like what is this character no
MCDM-441||obviously I know everything there is to know about this campaign setting but the NPC
MCDM-442||doesn't so I often have we talked about this in the information video I often make sure there was a very poor
MCDM-443||signal-to-noise ratio the NPC might have a lot to say but does that mean that they're right does that mean they can be
MCDM-444||trusted a farmer knows a lot about farming and he knows a lot about the local town but he does know a lot about
MCDM-445||much else if you're talking about farmers or peasants or local townspeople it's reasonable to assume that they
MCDM-446||might be really superstitious and they believe that the local force is haunted does that mean it is haunted well that's
MCDM-447||up to you but maybe not because the DM knows everything because the DM is the ultimate authority of the table there's
MCDM-448||an overwhelming tendency for the players to just accept everything your NPC's say as the gospel because it's coming from
MCDM-449||the DM so I often make sure my NPCs say things that the players immediately go oh wait a minute of course this guy
MCDM-450||thinks this because of course he thinks the force is haunted he's a peasant of course he thinks that demons abducted
MCDM-451||the blacksmith's daughter because he's never seen a goblin before if they need it dwarf NPC the dwarf advises violence
MCDM-452||because dwarves in my setting are like short Klingons their honor obsessed they love alcohol and they love
MCDM-453||fighting I've had many instances where dwarf NPC advised just a frontal assault on whatever the problem was and the
MCDM-454||players go whoa is that possible are we gonna win and the dwarf like win who cares if we win at which point the
MCDM-455||players are like okay we we can't listen to this guy I know we've talked about this before so that's how I view NPC
MCDM-456||creation I don't worry about backstory I don't worry really about accents or voices I do concentrate a little bit on
MCDM-457||mannerisms I worry about their motivation what is this NPC what did I worry about their personality how do
MCDM-458||they express themselves and then I think about what is their station what place does this NPC occupy in the world are
MCDM-459||they a peasant are they a nobleman then I think about how does this NPC view the heroes because that's I think the best
MCDM-460||thing an NPC can do is show the players themselves show them a point of view each NPCs can have a different point of
MCDM-461||view toward the characters I'll give you some examples we're gonna talk about three different NPCs that I've used
MCDM-462||recently the first is Lord Edmund betta gar Lord Edmund betta gar is a 13 year old
MCDM-463||nobleman the players thought the family betta gar had been dead murdered by orcs but the orcs kept one of the family
MCDM-464||alive in case they needed to use him for bargaining purposes so when I created Lord Edmund I thought about two things I
MCDM-465||thought about what is his motivation what is his personality one his motivation is to do his duty he's a
MCDM-466||nobleman he's going to find out when he talks to the heroes that his entire family is dead that he is the last
MCDM-467||member of the family betta gar and also that he is the baron a minute ago he was a 13 year old kid how
MCDM-468||captive by the orcs but now not only is he free he realizes I'm the baron so that's his motivations motivation is
MCDM-469||to do his duty was his personality well he's a nobleman so he's gonna be very haughty imperious not because he's
MCDM-470||trying to be off-putting because that's how he was raised I think he was the first legitimate nobleman my players had
MCDM-471||met and so it was important to me to make sure that they understood that this is a feudal society and there is a
MCDM-472||proper way to treat noblemen here everything else about Lord Edmund fell out of those two things one his
MCDM-473||motivation do my duty to his personality very haughty and noble maybe the most important element of his personality
MCDM-474||came out during playes not something I had written down or anything it was the fact that I realized as I was playing
MCDM-475||him that he's a 13 year old kid but at the same time he's the baron and he is aware of that making your NPCs
MCDM-476||self-aware aware of how they are perceived as a big deal he knows I'm just a kid but he also knows I am the
MCDM-477||Baron so it was important to Lord Edmund that other people treat him like the baron that was a problem he needed to
MCDM-478||solve immediately if they just treated him like a 13 year old kid then they wouldn't give him the respect that he
MCDM-479||needed as a nobleman and the existence of nobleman is largely just a shared illusion there's no physical quality
MCDM-480||that makes a nobleman different than a peasant so when he dealt with the PCs he demanded they treat him like a nobleman
MCDM-481||and they didn't like that by the way they very quickly got sick of this kin he confronted them several times he made
MCDM-482||it an issue and in each case they backed off when he said you will address me as my Lord or sire graves played by my
MCDM-483||friend Phil was like all right Phil said several times I'm really starting to hate this kid but he did it this created
MCDM-484||a lot of interesting tension it was the first opportunity for the players to decide where do we stand on the whole
MCDM-485||feudalism thing whose side are we on when Lord Edmond said you will refer to me as sire or my lord he didn't do it in
MCDM-486||an accent he didn't do with any kind of crazy mannerism he just acted like a nobleman and it put a crisis in front of
MCDM-487||the players would they do that it forced them to think about how do we feel about this how do we feel not just about this
MCDM-488||kid but the idea of there being a bear and a better guard do we care who's in charge well it turned out they did
MCDM-489||because their enemy was Lord Saxton the usurper so even though they didn't like this kid he was the legitimate heir it
MCDM-490||was useful for them to keep him alive that moment where Edmond said you will refer to me as sire or my Lord became a
MCDM-491||kind of microcosm for the entire idea of feudalism the idea of chaos versus law where are the players going to fall on
MCDM-492||that spectrum and the fact that Lord Edmonds attitude was kind of annoying this imperious thirteen-year-old kid got
MCDM-493||their nerves because of the way he insisted they treat him it made it so that it was a real test it would have
MCDM-494||been easy for them to just lock him back up again they talked about that that's one of the things I enjoy doing with
MCDM-495||NPCs is testing the players beliefs sure the Paladin wants to do the right thing but it's kind of hard to do the right
MCDM-496||thing when the NPC who needs help is being a huge helping somebody who is sympathetic is easy helping
MCDM-497||somebody who is not sympathetic is a little bit more difficult and that's dramatic having conceded to Lord Edmonds
MCDM-498||request and treated him like a nobleman which he had insisted on them doing later on he returned the favor and made
MCDM-499||Nicodemus The Count of Rennes that's the reason Nicodemus is the count of Rennes if you missed that episode and at that
MCDM-500||moment I mean nothing about Lord Edmond had changed he was still the imperious haughty thirteen-year-old kid but at
MCDM-501||that moment they really liked this character because everything he had done had been consistent making Nicodemus the
MCDM-502||count of Rennes had been a noble activity just as insisting on being called sire or my lord was another NPC I
MCDM-503||enjoyed running was edrick I think you got to see me run edrick in the stream with girls playing variks now ed ryx job
MCDM-504||was to support Vargas he was an npc in for kisses party edrick was a cleric I created him because Gertz was playing by
MCDM-505||himself and in case he got in over his head I want to make sure that he had some help so of course the best support
MCDM-506||character is a cleric but I never wanted Adric to feel like an equal edrick was always someone who looked up to vork
MCDM-507||asst edrick was a peasant edrick was a cleric but he was just one of the guys at the church that you know lit candles
MCDM-508||and stuff like that he was never a hero he was never an adventurer he's very pious he knows some things he knows a
MCDM-509||lot about the church but doesn't know anything about the wide world he was always deferring to curse he was always
MCDM-510||deferring to variks there were several points in the adventure where Gertz turned to me as edrick and tried to get
MCDM-511||me to give him some clues as to what he should do but I never did I would give him several options but some of them
MCDM-512||would be crazy that forced Gertz to lead I got the sense that Gertz want to collaborate but
MCDM-513||I'm the DM don't collaborate with me lead be a leader be a hero and with edrick in tow it was kind of easy for
MCDM-514||vork us to be leader I know Eric's motivation which is survive follow forcas but now I need to know his
MCDM-515||mannerism I know what he would say now I need to know how he would say it I gave edrick and I kind of at the time thought
MCDM-516||of this as kind of cheating I gave edrick one mannerism and that is I gave him a stammer I watched a lot of I
MCDM-517||Claudius when I was a kid derek jacobi playing Claudius had a stammer so I just ripped that off you
MCDM-518||know derek jacobi the actor did a lot of work and study people that had a stammer wouldn't be comedic it wouldn't be
MCDM-519||disrespectful and I just stole it giving him a stammer giving this one kind of flamboyant mannerism unlocked all this
MCDM-520||other stuff about his personality that I didn't know until I was playing him he would be self-conscious of his damn er
MCDM-521||he would have issues with self-confidence he was constantly saying Devore Kasai I mean useless it was up to
MCDM-522||vork us to give him encouragement to say we're gonna make it you're gonna be okay and for Kurtz that made playing vork cos
MCDM-523||feel like playing a hero all that just from the stammer and I didn't worry about the self-confidence in the self
MCDM-524||loathing about that character until I was playing him he was born once I started playing him then when I stopped
MCDM-525||he died these were things I discovered as I was playing him based solely on the idea that he wanted to serve vork as he
MCDM-526||was a follower he want to get out of here alive and he had a stammer my last example and we're pretty close to the
MCDM-527||end of this video is a normal everyday peasant a farmer that the revenant vow met on their first adventure the players
MCDM-528||were first level in the adventure was against the cult of the reptile God we should probably do a series on the
MCDM-529||adventures that I have run and that I liked because if I tell you what I learned from running that adventure then
MCDM-530||you can run it and I will have saved you some time for my money against the cult of the reptile God is maybe the best
MCDM-531||starting adventure and it's all about this cult that has taken over a town when the players come to the town and
MCDM-532||against the cult of the reptile God they meet three kinds of NPCs first they meet normal everyday NPCs who just feel like
MCDM-533||our town is cursed and a lot of the people that I knew and grew up with are acting strange
MCDM-534||second they meet some of those people who are acting strange they're under the effect of a domination spell third they
MCDM-535||meet some of the bad guys in charge of this cult the ones who are putting the other NPCs under the domination spell
MCDM-536||but early on the players don't know this yet the first NPC the players met was a
MCDM-537||farmer they knew there was something going on in the town and they kind of used this farmer as a case study
MCDM-538||patient zero what's going on here in this town let's talk to this farmer so I thought about who is this guy he's a
MCDM-539||farmer he wants to provide for his family that's his goal that's what makes him toil all day in the Sun and I
MCDM-540||thought about how is he going to express himself what is this personality well that came from the way the PCs reacted I
MCDM-541||just made sure that this guy was incredibly deferential he wouldn't look the heroes in the eye if they asked
MCDM-542||questions he answered simply and didn't say any more than he had to because this guy has met adventures before he knows
MCDM-543||their trouble and he knows that the best thing to do is just leave them alone he thinks of adventures as being above him
MCDM-544||he's stuck here on a farm they can go travel the world yeah they're going to risk their lives doing crazy stuff but
MCDM-545||they're gonna make a lot of money doing it so from his point of view they're not noblemen but they are of a
MCDM-546||higher station than he is and anytime a peasant like him is interacted with them the best thing to do is just get out of
MCDM-547||there alive say as little as possible and try to make it out of the encounter alive that actually proved a little bit
MCDM-548||difficult because when he wasn't immediately forthcoming and open and just answer every question the heroes
MCDM-549||had they started to kind of get angry at him he was so deferential and monosyllabic that the players started to
MCDM-550||think maybe he is one of these dominated NPCs one of the players actually tried to provoke this farmer he would push him
MCDM-551||around flick his ear he'd dug up his vegetable garden and the funny thing about that was the more aggressive this
MCDM-552||PC this player character was the more convinced this farmer was that his beliefs regarding adventurers were right
MCDM-553||they are terrible people just leave them alone after the aggressive PC was done bullying this farmer the other players
MCDM-554||made him feel bad so the PC said well no hard feelings and through this farmer gold piece and the farmer literally does
MCDM-555||not react to the gold piece just falls in the dirt that was the farmers incredibly passive-aggressive way of
MCDM-556||telling the heroes to go screw I don't want your money once again I had created a dramatic
MCDM-557||situation I didn't really do it on purpose I just thought about what is this character's motivation and how does
MCDM-558||he express himself and at the end of that process we got to a point where one of the characters was bullying this guy
MCDM-559||and then as a kind of half-assed apology throws him a gold piece well that's exactly the kind of behavior that makes
MCDM-560||NPCs like this farmer hate adventures because all they think about is gold the gold piece itself became this kind of
MCDM-561||symbol for the relationship between adventurers and peasants and after that adventure that night I actually wrote up
MCDM-562||a whole scene I'll included in the doobly-doo covering what this farmer did immediately after encountering the
MCDM-563||heroes and I used it as an example to illustrate how bad things have gotten in the town a lot of people were leaving
MCDM-564||the town which is what the cultists wanted and that proved to be a very effective way to show the players how
MCDM-565||they were perceived and kind of motivate them to be better characters because after I wrote that thing they felt
MCDM-566||really bad for this farmer now in each instance I don't think any of those NPCs I just talked about were particularly
MCDM-567||flamboyant characters but they each provided memorable moments in the campaign because I focused on the
MCDM-568||characters motivation rather than some outrageous accent it grounded these characters and it made the world feel
MCDM-569||more real and it gave the players a lot of perspective on how they were perceived and how the world works
MCDM-570||hopefully some of this advice is useful but it's the advice I've got so if you have any questions please come by the
MCDM-571||comments and let me know maybe we'll do another video later NPCs part 2 I've had a couple people online
MCDM-572||plain isn't the right word but bring up the fact that we do fewer running the game videos now when we do campaign
MCDM-573||Diaries more and I talk about movies every once in a while I just want everybody know that like the campaign
MCDM-574||Diaries a lot of people like the campaign Diaries I think there's a lot of great DM advice in them and because
MCDM-575||we play every week and people are kind of engaged with the story I feel like I have to do those those are the minimum
MCDM-576||campaign Diaries I don't wanna get behind on and I don't want to skip any because then people who are watching
MCDM-577||they'll be like well wait what happened my goal is absolutely to continue doing running the game videos but the campaign
MCDM-578||Diaries are kind of the first video I have to make each week is how to D&D go that week and then sometimes I'm struck
MCDM-579||by an idea like I did that video on 2001 that a lot of people really liked but I know some people that's not what they
MCDM-580||come here for that's why I put all these videos in different playlists and I believe you can subscribe to the
MCDM-581||playlist you want otherwise the channel is called Matthew Colville it's not called how to be a better DM so you come
MCDM-582||here you get the kind of stuff I'm interested in I've had a couple of people actually following my campaign
MCDM-583||diary start doing their own campaign Diaries and I thought they were really cool i link to both of them in the
MCDM-584||doobly-doo I hope people do more I think the campaign diary and YouTube is a great way to memorialize your game plus
MCDM-585||who knows people like really engage with the story that's happening at your table that's it for the NPC video folks I hope
MCDM-586||there was some useful advice in there as usual there are no ads in front of my D&D content I do not have a patreon if
MCDM-587||you want to help support the channel I encourage you to come by my author page on Amazon there's a link in the
MCDM-588||doobly-doo I am an independent fantasy author that means I write fantasy novels and I sell them direct to you I am
MCDM-589||philosophically opposed to middleman it's one of the reasons I love YouTube I don't advertise my books in the movie
MCDM-590||stuff I do so you will see ads in front of those hopefully it's not too annoying until next time peace out
MCDM-591||it's well after midnight somewhere deep in the dungeon the players have chosen a room they already cleared out to hole up
MCDM-592||for the night and rest many of them are wounded they used up many spells they need to rest they need to spend the
MCDM-593||night in the dungeon fearful of the creatures that lurk outside they set up two watches two hours into the second
MCDM-594||watch check the door of an war priest with the high wisdom and therefore high perception here's something something
MCDM-595||outside the door he gestures to Nicodemus the half war fighter now count Nicodemus of rend Nicodemus looks from
MCDM-596||Keck to the door Nicodemus hasn't heard anything but he watches as Keck picks up his Moll and prepares for battle
MCDM-597||Nicodemus slowly and quietly stands up preparing his great two-handed war axe wound Keck presses his ear to the door
MCDM-598||and listens there is something without he says Nicodemus hisses keep your voice down
MCDM-599||what you hear on the other side of the door they hear a sound something sniffing they hear heavy footprints
MCDM-600||there's something just on the other side of the door that can smell them this is sniffing them out Keck wielding the
MCDM-601||two-handed Maul of zarach the lawgiver looks at Nicodemus and says we should attack should use the element of
MCDM-602||surprise Nicodemus looks down at the dwarf and says are you crazy wait Keck restrains
MCDM-603||himself they both listen at the door and they hear the sniffing sound move on whatever was on the other side of the
MCDM-604||door whatever was looking for them didn't find them and the night passes uneventful II that's because I asked the
MCDM-605||players to make two roles for random encounters I use a d12 I'll explain why later and I say if you roll an 11 or a
MCDM-606||12 there's a random encounter and the players rolled a 6 for the first watch and a 10 for the next watch so I just
MCDM-607||role played the process of something in the dungeon the players don't know what on patrol looking for them sniffing for
MCDM-608||them but in this case whatever was on the other side of the door whatever is looking for them didn't find them hey
MCDM-609||everybody matt covert here we're going to talk about some proper dungeon master advice this episode is about random
MCDM-610||encounters we're also going to do a giveaway at the end of the episode tied to a certain number of subscribers so
MCDM-611||stay tuned it's related to the map building stuff we've been doing on Twitch I hope you've had a chance to
MCDM-612||check it out if not don't worry I'm probably gonna make a video at the end summarizing the whole thing I didn't
MCDM-613||always use random encounters in my game in fact I know some dm's never use them I think it's purely down to your style
MCDM-614||of play and as a dungeon master my style of play changes almost with every campaign I run the game I'm currently
MCDM-615||running at Turtle Rock Studios is kind of a throwback to the old school way of running D&D we're just getting
MCDM-616||point A to point B is dangerous and that's where the idea of random encounters comes from so under no
MCDM-617||circumstance should you feel as though random encounters are something that you should use or have to use it is a tool
MCDM-618||in your toolbox and I really think it's down to your style of play it's something that either you do often in
MCDM-619||this campaign because you're going for a certain feel or it's something you hardly ever do because your game is more
MCDM-620||narrative focused it's more story driven we inherit the idea of random encounters from a game that existed before Dungeons
MCDM-621||& Dragons in fact if you went and bought the three little brown booklets the original version of D&D that was
MCDM-622||published in 1974 it explicitly told you that in order to play D&D you needed this other game actually needed two
MCDM-623||other games you needed chainmail in order to handle combat and then you needed something from another company
MCDM-624||entirely this was not a game that TSR made it was a game that they all owned and used from a company called Avalon
MCDM-625||Hill it was called outdoor survival there's a picture of it over here it was one of their bookcase game series not
MCDM-626||entirely unlike merchants of Venus which is a game I love I have lots of Avalon Hill bookcase games Avalon hills outdoor
MCDM-627||survival was its own self-contained game and it was a game that all the folks who ran and played Dungeons and Dragons back
MCDM-628||in 1974 all owned so it was an easy thing for them to just use it to deal with Overland movement you can see the
MCDM-629||outdoor survival map here was always the same map and the idea was that depending on the scenario you would start in one
MCDM-630||hex and your goal was to get remember hexes we're back to hexes you would start in one hacks and try to get to
MCDM-631||another hex and the farther away they were the harder it was to do and you would have to roll on these various
MCDM-632||charts to see what happened as you tried to go over these mountains or go through this forest and just getting from point
MCDM-633||A to point B was the entire game of outdoor survival the game they were playing was called Dungeons and Dragons
MCDM-634||the idea was that the game master designed a dungeon the rules explicitly tell the dungeon master you need to come
MCDM-635||up with six levels of dungeon before you start your first game the idea of playing in a city or playing in the
MCDM-636||wilderness or having an entire adventure just take place in the town did not occur to these guys when they first
MCDM-637||started the fun the juice of the game was exploring dungeons and each Game Master had his own dungeon we don't
MCDM-638||really play that way anymore but when you went from the dungeon back to town you would use this other game you would
MCDM-639||use outdoor survival to determine what happened when you got from the dungeon back to town
MCDM-640||just getting the loot the treasure that you got from the dungeon back to your town so you could spend it so you could
MCDM-641||use it was a big deal is considered an accomplishment that should explain a lot of how random encounters in Overland
MCDM-642||movement work and it also kind of explains some of the monsters in D&D there are lots of monsters and dungeons
MCDM-643||and dragons that you would probably never encounter if you never used overland movement random encounters in
MCDM-644||fact there used to be a stat monsters had a stat in the monster manual in the original Monster Manual and the stat was
MCDM-645||percent chance in lair the idea being if you encountered this monster as a result of an overland movement random encounter
MCDM-646||what are the odds that you came across it while it was in its lair you know it's a very different experience to
MCDM-647||fight a black dragon for instance on the wing so to speak it sees the players camp as it flies over hunting during the
MCDM-648||night that's one experience there the dragon kind of has the advantage it can swoop down it can breathe acid on you
MCDM-649||and it can fly away when it's wounded but fighting a black dragon in its lair is a very different experience for one
MCDM-650||thing that's where it's treasure is if you kill the black dragon because it attacked you while you were making camp
MCDM-651||in the middle of the forest then you probably didn't get any treasure as a result but if you fight it while it's in
MCDM-652||its lair then you will get treasure but the flipside of that is the black dragon can't really retreat this is its lair
MCDM-653||there's nowhere for it to retreat to so if you fight a black dragon out in the forest out in the wilderness in the
MCDM-654||middle of the night if things get too hairy for the heroes or if the black dragon gets too wounded the dragon can
MCDM-655||fly away not so in the lair so you get a sense of how built into the bones of Dungeons & Dragons random encounters are
MCDM-656||nowadays I think a lot of games are more narrative and story focused and so the idea of exploring of just getting from
MCDM-657||point A to point B being dangerous I don't think we use that I think it's somewhat unfashionable it is mentioned
MCDM-658||in the Dungeon Master's guide and there are other uses for it besides just making overland movement difficult
MCDM-659||random encounters are also incredibly useful in the dungeon in fact I think they are probably used in the dungeon
MCDM-660||these days more than for Overland movement I think in this day and age if you're just trying to get from point A
MCDM-661||to point B the only stuff that will happen to you is stuff that the dungeon master has already cooked up like
MCDM-662||somebody ambushes you like maybe bandits ambushed you it depends on the adventure you're running even dungeon crawls I
MCDM-663||think in this day and age or somewhat out of fashion I still use them I love dungeon crawls I
MCDM-664||probably always will but a lot of adventures these days are more narrative and story focused so the bad guys that
MCDM-665||you're fighting aren't all you know collected in some underground complex so it tells you
MCDM-666||a lot about me as a dungeon master that I am running a game that not only features dungeons like proper
MCDM-667||underground complexes but also making Overland Movement dangerous I am deliberately running a game that is a
MCDM-668||kind of throwback to the games they ran in 70s in the 80s because I have a kind of nostalgia for that even though I only
MCDM-669||started playing in the mid to late 80s I have this crazy nostalgia for an era that I didn't belong to we need a word
MCDM-670||for that in English nostalgia for an era that you weren't a part of so you may find that like wilderness survival a
MCDM-671||dungeons aren't to your taste which is fine but if you do use dungeons if you do have players exploring these
MCDM-672||underground complexes or castles or whatever where there are several combat encounters in a row and there's no way
MCDM-673||for the players to do it all in one day then it may be useful for you to use random encounters because ultimately the
MCDM-674||idea of exploring this underground complex of dealing with all these monsters that are all grouped together
MCDM-675||is a question of resource management players are of course risk-averse they want to risk as little as possible so if
MCDM-676||you give them the chance they will rest they'll take a long rest after every encounter I mean why not realistically
MCDM-677||speaking if you had to fight a bunch of orcs in order to survive just one encounter with orcs would probably wipe
MCDM-678||you out and you would say you know what let's stop and rest until we are fully healthy and have all our spells back so
MCDM-679||random encounters in the dungeon are a way to counter that desire it is a perfectly natural desire there was
MCDM-680||nothing wrong with the players deciding that they want to spend the night after the first encounter but you want to
MCDM-681||discourage that because it robs the adventure of tension and that's the whole point of doing this is drama right
MCDM-682||tension and resolution random encounters also reinforce the idea that the world is a dangerous place that the dungeon is
MCDM-683||dangerous to explore and that the wilderness is dangerous to explore of course this has to scale by level a
MCDM-684||ninth level party probably no longer worries about getting ambushed by goblins in the middle of the forest in
MCDM-685||fact a nice level party probably has lots of ways of getting from point A to point B that do not involve walking
MCDM-686||there so to a certain extent the idea of overland movement causing random encounters is based on the hero's being
MCDM-687||somewhat low level so let's talk about how I do it let's talk about how I run random encounters and of course if
MCDM-688||you've watched my videos you should know that I am NOT saying this is the right way to do it it's not it's not even the
MCDM-689||only way I have done it it's just the way I'm doing it right now typically the players start in town and
MCDM-690||they have some rumors so I'm word someone they've met that has told them about someplace out in the
MCDM-691||wilderness that is relevant to their interests like there's a goblin mine in the swamp or like those are ruined keep
MCDM-692||in the forest and the players can count the number of hexes between where they're starting where they're trying to
MCDM-693||get to and again we're back to hexes right now you're starting to understand why I like them they provide a nice
MCDM-694||little unit of measurement the players count the number of hexes and I have them make one roll for every wilderness
MCDM-695||hex they move through now that means if they're going a long way away if they're going 10x is 240 miles away they're
MCDM-696||gonna be making 10 rolls which is why I tend to have all the wilderness stuff near where the players are so let's
MCDM-697||imagine that the place they're trying to get to is 5 hexes away from the town they're starting in that means they have
MCDM-698||to make 5 rolls that's 5 chances for them to have a random encounter there are lots of ways to determine whether or
MCDM-699||not there was a random encounter in the woods and in fact I've played games where it was modified by whether or not
MCDM-700||there was a ranger in the party Rangers made it less likely that there would be a random encounter and in fact I also
MCDM-701||think that in the players handbook actual Rangers and fifth addition are impossible to surprise in their favorite
MCDM-702||terrain which is fantastic and actually at one point resulted in the players making different decisions when they
MCDM-703||traveled which i think is neat they went through the forest instead of taking the road because they had a ranger with them
MCDM-704||whose favourite terrain was forest and they were told that the road was dangerous that there were bandits on the
MCDM-705||road and in fact if they had taken the road they would have been ambushed by bandits but they listened to the Ranger
MCDM-706||who said we should go through the forest and as a result there was no encounter but typically what I do is for every hex
MCDM-707||they're moving through in the wilderness this doesn't count typically on roads or in civilization every hex they're moving
MCDM-708||through in the wilderness I have them roll a 12-sided die because I just like 12 sided dice and I don't think they get
MCDM-709||used that much they just use a six sided die back in the 70s and I think if you got a six there was a random encounter
MCDM-710||so if they're moving through five wilderness hexes I tell the players to roll five times and they get a random
MCDM-711||encounter if they get an 11 or 12 why 11 or 12 on a 12 sided die I don't know I just made it up I think it's because it
MCDM-712||harkens back to that old-school d6 way of doing things and I tell the players if you roll an 11 you're going to be on
MCDM-713||one sharp but if you roll a 12 then you get a harder encounter right rolling higher on the 12 side died rolling a 12
MCDM-714||is more dangerous so I imply that there are two charts for each type of train there is the easy chart and the
MCDM-715||difficult chart and it depends what they roll what chart they get and of course there's a 10 and 12 or a 5 and 6 chance
MCDM-716||that nothing happens now if you know me if you and paying attention you may have
MCDM-717||guessed I have no charts that notion the thing I lied my players I literally say that there is a different chart for an
MCDM-718||eleven versus a twelve but there are no charts I just want them to feel like these things are objective that these
MCDM-719||are the rules of the world that this isn't just something matt has made up so I lie and I say that if they roll an 11
MCDM-720||they get the easy chart if they roll a 12 they get the difficult chart got 1 through 10 nothing happens but the trick
MCDM-721||here is if they get an encounter once they get an encounter then that's it we deal with the encounter and they don't
MCDM-722||have to roll anymore the goal of the random encounter during Overland movement is just to make the world feel
MCDM-723||dangerous it's not to maximize how many bad guys they fight so once they get a random encounter we resolve it and then
MCDM-724||I take it easy on them and I say ok you manage to reach your destination the funny thing though is even though I made
MCDM-725||up the idea that there are two different charts a hard one if they roll a 12 and an easy one if they roll in 11 there
MCDM-726||actually is a tool online which we'll look at in a minute that has easy moderate and difficult charts you can
MCDM-727||roll on and now I use that so first I made it up and then I discovered that there was a tool online that made my
MCDM-728||nonsense seem real that's the great thing about running D&D in this day and age is whatever problem you're trying to
MCDM-729||solve other people lots of other people have tried to solve this problem and someone has probably created a tool to
MCDM-730||make it easy now I say there are two charts one easy and one difficult but even the easy chart is somewhat nasty
MCDM-731||the idea being that a random encounter that happens in the wilderness should be challenging it needs to be challenging
MCDM-732||otherwise it's a waste of time because the players will quickly learn they will conclude rightly that this is the only
MCDM-733||thing they're going to do that day when you're traveling through the wilderness days pass and nothing happens so if they
MCDM-734||encounter a bad guy out here in the middle of the forest the players know this is probably the only bad guy we're
MCDM-735||going to encounter let's use all our resources let's cast all our spells let's use our wild shape let's do
MCDM-736||everything now I have the players role once per hex but I have in the past and I've played with other DMS that have
MCDM-737||them role once period and modify the role by the number of hexes so maybe if you move far enough you guarantee the
MCDM-738||idea that you're going to get an encounter that's down to taste it makes perfect sense to me the idea that you're
MCDM-739||going to roll one die it's less die rolling right but I think players like rolling dice that's one of the reasons I
MCDM-740||have the players roll for the random encounters I could do it behind the screen and a lot of DMS do but I like
MCDM-741||the idea that their fate is in their hands so I tell the players to roll if they're traveling through many hexes
MCDM-742||then that might mean a lot of rolls and maybe for you it makes more sense if they all make one roll
MCDM-743||and then modify it by the number of hexes they're moving through or the number of miles they travel if you don't
MCDM-744||like hexes and in that case I probably wouldn't use the d12 I would probably use percentile dice because I would
MCDM-745||still want to be possible for nothing to happen so you might say there is a 25% chance of you guys getting a random
MCDM-746||encounter maybe it's down to terrain maybe it's 20% into 4 is 25% in the mountains and then modify it by one
MCDM-747||percent or three percent for every hex they move through that would make it unlikely that you'd ever end up in a
MCDM-748||situation where you would be guaranteed to get a random encounter because that would make it not very random but of
MCDM-749||course random encounters are also random because a you don't know if one is going to happen and then B you don't know what
MCDM-750||you're going to fight so there are lots of charts online there's a tool we'll look at in a minute for generating a
MCDM-751||random encounter but I have often pretended to roll on a chart behind the screen but really I'm just looking
MCDM-752||through the monster manual to see what's cool and my idea of what is fun to use in a random encounter is affected by the
MCDM-753||fact that some of the monsters in the monster manual you're probably never going to encounter unless you have
MCDM-754||random encounters out in the wilderness like the players were trying to get from point A to point B in my Thursday night
MCDM-755||game they had a random encounter and I decided to use a wyvern now of course I told them I rolled randomly but I didn't
MCDM-756||I just thought oh we Verne's are cool when was the last time I used one I may never use one let's use one tonight and
MCDM-757||it was a lot of fun actually it was the first time the players had had any kind of random encounter out in the
MCDM-758||wilderness and they learned a lot for instance when they found out when they decided to make camp that night they
MCDM-759||found out that side the elven Ranger he's an elf he doesn't need to sleep he just meditates and they were like well
MCDM-760||does that mean we don't need to take watch and they're like yeah I don't think that mean I think that the elf can
MCDM-761||basically watch for us cuz half the night he doesn't need to sleep and the other half he's just sitting there
MCDM-762||meditating so let's all just go to that which meant when the wyvern attacked only Sai was awake he was the only one
MCDM-763||in his armor everyone else was asleep and unarmored and that's when they found out it takes like 10 minutes to put your
MCDM-764||armor on I didn't give them any advice in this regard I let them play the way they wanted to they were very low level
MCDM-765||characters and this was how they learned to set watch because once you've said watches you have characters that begin
MCDM-766||battle in their armor super useful I had a lot of fun with that encounter watching the players scramble around
MCDM-767||trying to deal with the fact that only one of them had any armor on and a wyvern is an incredibly nasty thing to
MCDM-768||throw up against a low level party but I reasoned thusly wise yes it is a powerful bad guy and it may indeed very
MCDM-769||badly wound one of the heroes I made sure it didn't kill anybody but once the heroes had
MCDM-770||done enough damaged it I had it fly away because it's a wild animal it's out looking for food it sees some
MCDM-771||defenseless humans it decides to try to eat them once they put up enough of a fight I haven't leaved
MCDM-772||so this is one of the kind of interesting side effects of using a high-level monster as part of a random
MCDM-773||encounter if it attacks the heroes while they've made camp and are just spending the night then once it's taken enough
MCDM-774||damage it's going to run away I still award full experience in a situation like that because the players dealt with
MCDM-775||the random encounter but if the players come across the monster in its lair while they're traveling from point A to
MCDM-776||point B then the players have all the power the players are in a position to opt in to decide whether or not to go
MCDM-777||after this monster it's a very tough monster because that's the nature of a random encounter but it's with its
MCDM-778||treasure it's in its lair the players get a greater reward if they beat it and because the players have come upon the
MCDM-779||monster in its lair they have the advantage they have the opportunity to get all the information they want and
MCDM-780||they have the element of surprise it's time to put on your makeup and then missing a huge opportunity here because
MCDM-781||we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise so what could be more surprising than
MCDM-782||the first Battalion transvestite burgade so that's how I handle encounters in Overland movement the players in my
MCDM-783||campaign in one group their fourth level in another group their sixth level and I think the sixth level party is basically
MCDM-784||done with random encounters in the Overland they have their own method for getting from point A to point B that
MCDM-785||means they don't have to go through the forest they don't have to roll dice for every X and they're now high enough
MCDM-786||level that other stuff is going to start trying to avoid them this process of the player is kind of outgrowing random
MCDM-787||encounters also helps them feel like they've accomplished something like they've grown and developed as heroes
MCDM-788||the kind of stuff that used to really challenge them when they were first second third level now doesn't even
MCDM-789||happen anymore it's another thing that happens when you play D&D for a while you get a high
MCDM-790||level character you start missing that earlier kind of play where being low level you worried about just getting
MCDM-791||from point A to point B on the one hand it's an accomplishment when you don't have to worry about it anymore on the
MCDM-792||other hand it's a fun sense of accomplishment when you actually do it when you actually make it from point A
MCDM-793||to point B and deal with the random encounter using these creatures like with runes and we'll the wisps in their
MCDM-794||native environment and the wilderness makes the world feel richer and more plausible because the types of creatures
MCDM-795||the players encounter are widened not only are there creatures down here where this is their native environment and
MCDM-796||you're just moving through their home and that's why they're attacking you they're hungry they're looking for food
MCDM-797||the game also includes guys up here crazy things like B holders and mind flayers a game that has a wide variety
MCDM-798||of different bad guys to fight in different environments I think is a game that feels more plausible and more
MCDM-799||grounded which is again down to your style of play in the dungeon or whatever kind of underground complex they were
MCDM-800||dealing with or above-ground it could be a castle or a temple but anytime the players are trying to clear out a lot of
MCDM-801||rooms that are full of bad guys a place that has multiple levels the players are going to very quickly decide that they
MCDM-802||want to rest because they want to minimize risk now this is a very different experience than the overland
MCDM-803||movement thing or they're just trying to get from point A to point B here they're in a dungeon they're fighting for their
MCDM-804||lives they're questing after some bad guy they're trying to stop or some treasure they're trying to acquire and
MCDM-805||especially if you have new players after the first encounter they might say well I just took a lot of damage or I'm out
MCDM-806||of spells let's stop not let's rest for an hour let's spend the night and if they do
MCDM-807||that then it kind of removes the tension from the game so it's your job as the dungeon master to put the tension back
MCDM-808||in and that's one of the things random encounters are great for and I think sometimes just the threat of
MCDM-809||a random encounter is enough to keep the players going but again you want the random encounters in the dungeon to be
MCDM-810||nastier than the normal things they would be dealing with otherwise they'll just opt for the random encounter if the
MCDM-811||random encounters are skeletons but the stuff they're fighting in the dungeon is ghouls and whites then of course the
MCDM-812||players will stop and rest because they'd rather fight skeletons in the random encounter than ghouls and whites
MCDM-813||while they explore so that's another piece of advice whatever you're dealing with in the adventure the random
MCDM-814||encounter should be nastier because it disincentivizes the players from stopping and the way I do it is if they
MCDM-815||take a short rest they roll once if they take a long rest they roll twice once for each watch now that doesn't make any
MCDM-816||literal sense and my players always say wait a minute if it's one check for a short rest on a short rest as an hour
MCDM-817||shouldn't that mean eight checks for a long rest because a long rest is eight hours and indeed you could do that if
MCDM-818||you want but I think eight checks is pretty unforgiving so I say no it's it's once per watch as Dungeon Master's it's
MCDM-819||up to us to control the pacing of the game just because it's one check for one hour during a short rest doesn't mean
MCDM-820||it's eight checks for a long rest that's eight hours that would be pretty tedious and that's why I like tying into watches
MCDM-821||I say there are two watches who's on first watch who's on second watch and I have each watch roll random
MCDM-822||encounters on the dungeon also incentivized the players to look at the dungeon
MCDM-823||more like a battlefield more like this is a thing they are exploring this is a thing they're moving through when they
MCDM-824||clear out one room they think to themselves this is a easily defensible place we should remember this for when
MCDM-825||we have to sleep we'll come back here and we'll borrow the door or one of the things that players ask about is on the
MCDM-826||list of things they can buy our Pitons they're like one of these things I'm like well there's a little metal spikes
MCDM-827||that you can hammer into a rock cliff face if you need to climb but they're all so easily used as spikes that you
MCDM-828||hammer under the door between the gap that's where the door on the floor to hammer a door shut if the bad guys find
MCDM-829||them in the middle of the night the fact that the door has been spiked shut means the players are going to get a couple of
MCDM-830||rounds where they can get ready prepare spells wake their sleeping allies up put on their armor before the bad guys
MCDM-831||inevitably burst through the door and there's a lot of tension there as the bad guys start attacking the door the
MCDM-832||heroes can see the door is starting to break and splinter under the assault now of course if your players have a long
MCDM-833||adventuring day and you feel as though a random encounter is too nasty for them then you roll behind the screen don't
MCDM-834||have them roll and take it easy on them roll 1 or 2 or just you know roll a d4 and ignore it
MCDM-835||random encounters are purely a tool that you can use to make the world feel more dangerous more threatening which in some
MCDM-836||ways makes it feel more plausible and control the pacing of the adventure the pacing of the game and kind of
MCDM-837||disincentivize your players from playing in the most risk-averse way possible I found a great tool for generating random
MCDM-838||encounters that I have actually used in the middle of my campaign I just looked for andum Leon line and found and I
MCDM-839||really liked it there's a link to it in the doobly-do you may have found your own random encounter resources online or
MCDM-840||you made your own in which case please link to them in the comments the more the merrier let's take a look at how
MCDM-841||this random encounter generator works and how I use ok this is the tool that I have found to use online for generating
MCDM-842||random encounters I feel it's pretty straightforward easy to use and I told my players when they roll an 11 they get
MCDM-843||the easy chart when they roll a 12 they roll the hard chart so I use hard or deadly here this tool lets pick hard and
MCDM-844||let's imagine that we were using this for the Thursday night group which is six fourth level players so I'm just
MCDM-845||going to go level four add player that's one two three four five six and they are moving through let's imagine they're
MCDM-846||moving through the hills it's going to do its best to try to pick monsters based on the environment that I've
MCDM-847||chosen minimum number of monster and chances we can do single types so they fight one type of something like lots of
MCDM-848||bugs or mixed types I think mixed types is cool I own the monster manual I don't just
MCDM-849||own the basic rules so we choose the monster manual you can pick a seed monster and it will do its best to say
MCDM-850||well an adult black dragon and what else what hangs out with an adult black dragon but here I'll say no seed
MCDM-851||monsters 15 seems like a lot so let's reduce the max number of monsters to 6 and generate a random encounter in suit
MCDM-852||we get four six fourth level heroes out in the Hills right oh they fight a stone golem okay that is super cool but I
MCDM-853||don't know what a stone golem is doing I mean a golem out in the middle of the but but that question why is there a
MCDM-854||Gollum Gollum is an automat on it's a construct it only follows orders it must have a master golem must have a master
MCDM-855||so there's probably a wizard or something or maybe the golem has escaped from some dungeon that's nearby and that
MCDM-856||to me is super cool although you could just take this remember there's no virtue in using the output of this as is
MCDM-857||it's not like the this tool has any great insight if you look at stone golem and go no that's too crazy what about a
MCDM-858||stone giant right stone giant stone golem don't have anything in common but the one reminded you of the other and
MCDM-859||you felt like the stones it was cool so why not use it let's see what I get if I generate another
MCDM-860||encounter cool a bunch of ores there are two orc eyes of Grunch there's an o raagh which is a kind of work two of
MCDM-861||them and there's one regular work and you might change it up you might say no I think there's three orcs one or AAG
MCDM-862||and one eye of Grunch there's no there's no reason to exactly use the numbers they've given you this is just a tool to
MCDM-863||inspire you let's see what happened I mean these are pretty cool encounters actually I like these four berserkers uh
MCDM-864||what does the berserker I think it's in the appendix to the Monster Manual what else might we get for Griffins I think a
MCDM-865||bunch of Griffin's like a patrol like a like a flock of Griffin's would be a great idea for a random
MCDM-866||encounter let's change it to underground right so now we're in a dungeon and let's click deadly the players rolled a
MCDM-867||12 on their 12 sided die what do they get this is going to be crazy let's see we get to psych off C's that reminds me
MCDM-868||of my favorite joke which is from Yellow Submarine hey there's a cyclops um but he's got two eyes or must be a bicycle
MCDM-869||ops it's a bicycle ops I love that so two Cyclops is in a dungeon that sort of makes sense although I might just go
MCDM-870||cyclopses or things I expect to find in the hills of the mountains let's try again ooh three black puddings let me
MCDM-871||tell you one black pudding is enough three black puddings is crazy but it's up to you how many black puddings to use
MCDM-872||black pudding is definitely something I would expect to find in a dungeon and it makes a great random encounter because
MCDM-873||it can get under the door so it because that's it's an it's just it's just a fungus on the ground so the players even
MCDM-874||if they've spiked the door shut the black pudding can still attack them I love that idea let's see what else might
MCDM-875||we get a bunch of orcs and a Manticore they keep these orcs and their Warchief keep this Manticore as a pet again why
MCDM-876||are there orcs in the dungeon isn't an orcish dungeon maybe if not if i feel as though i don't
MCDM-877||know that there were orcs down here I just clicked generate encounter again and I get a vampire that is a heart that
MCDM-878||is a deadly encounter that is definitely a deadly encounter what is the vampire doing down here well one of the things
MCDM-879||now I might just dismiss that or I might actually use it because one of the things I like about old-school
MCDM-880||adventures is that for instance I believe in against the cult of the reptile god the bad guy explicit to
MCDM-881||codify Ellis is in her lair she's asleep on a pile of coins but you might encounter her Elle
MCDM-882||we're in the dungeon she doesn't just stay in one place she goes on Patrol she visits her minions she gives them orders
MCDM-883||right she needs food so you might encounter the bad guy of this adventure not in his lair not in the final room
MCDM-884||not in the last room of the adventure and it might give the players an opportunity to encounter this bad guy
MCDM-885||fight them and then the bad guy retreats or the players retreat and now they have some information about who the bad guy
MCDM-886||is and how the bad guy operates I think that stuff is cool let's do one more I love random encounters this is fun
MCDM-887||this tool is neat is fun to use and it is also a great opportunity to be inspired as a dungeon master you don't
MCDM-888||have to use a vampire you could use a Janos Fink's our guy knows thinks it's a girl's Fink's Andros Fink's and guy
MCDM-889||knows Fink's and I think that you know what is one of these things doing wandering around they used to call
MCDM-890||wandering monsters I don't know let's see what else a flames call three flames calls that sounds cool a bunch of undead
MCDM-891||patrolling I think that's a cool idea especially in a dungeon the idea that there's a bunch of undead patrolling
MCDM-892||around so that's the random encounter episode I'll put a link to the tool in the doobly-doo it's up to you whether or
MCDM-893||not use random encounters and how you use them I hope you can see that I use them kind of I have a system but my
MCDM-894||system is kind of ad-hoc thanks for watching I hope that was useful I think random encounters are a great tool for
MCDM-895||new DMS to use we've been doing a lot of world-building and twitch on the weekends on Sunday at 11 o'clock we'll
MCDM-896||do another stream this coming up Sunday at 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time for this world building we've been doing in
MCDM-897||twitch I've been using hex OGG refer which I really like I enjoy using hex OGG refer because I like those
MCDM-898||old-school kind of maps I've done maps by hand I've done maps in campaign cartographer but for this campaign for
MCDM-899||this setting that I'm running right now I like that old-school feel and hex ographers a lot of fun to use it can
MCDM-900||generate like a random world and it does its best to kind of figure out where mountain ranges would go and where
MCDM-901||forests should be it's not literally just random terrain everywhere so in the spirit of the twitch building a world
MCDM-902||stream and because I like the software and because I actually like contests and giving stuff away I am going to give
MCDM-903||away a free copy you'll get serial numbers for every product that company inkwell ideas makes they make hex Agra
MCDM-904||fur they make dungeon Agra fur which we talked about earlier they makes it iographer so you can make cities and
MCDM-905||they have a great heraldry tool if you want to create your own heraldry so we just hit 14,000 subscribers a couple
MCDM-906||days ago let's do the giveaway when we hit 17,000 subscribers and it's going to work the way it worked when we gave away
MCDM-907||the meteoric iron day 20 or one who comments below is entered to win and once we hit 17,000 subscribers I'm
MCDM-908||going to randomly draw someone the winner gets a copy of hex Agra fir dungeon Agra fir and Sid iographer and
MCDM-909||their heraldry tool so you can make coats of arms for your world and that's about a hundred bucks actually you know
MCDM-910||the last giveaway was a die that was worth two hundred bucks so let's give away two copies of each of those pieces
MCDM-911||of software we'll have two winners I'll draw two names from the entries down below everybody who comments is entered
MCDM-912||once we hit 17,000 subscribers I'll pick two people and each of them will get one copy of each of those pieces of software
MCDM-913||so the faster we get to 17,000 subscribers the fewer comments there will be in the more likely it is that
MCDM-914||you'll win so feel free to share this channel share this video share some other video share the alignment video
MCDM-915||share the your first adventure video it's up to you I'm a big believer in social media I love it I'm on Twitter
MCDM-916||all the time I'm on reddit you can follow me on Twitter at Matt Colville I'm also Matt Koval on twitch that was
MCDM-917||the random encounters episode I hope it was useful as always there are no ads on this channel I don't have a patreon if
MCDM-918||you want to help support the channel come by my amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo I'm an independent
MCDM-919||fantasy author I have two novels out I'm working on my third novel a lot of people have bought them and some people
MCDM-920||seem to like them there's not gonna be a campaign diary this week I don't think because the two groups I have at Turtle
MCDM-921||Rock Studios I am merging into one group because with the advent of this YouTube channel I basically don't have time to
MCDM-922||run for two campaigns so I'm gonna run one campaign and the good news for you is I am going to film our campaign film
MCDM-923||I'm going to shoot I'm gonna record our games and you're gonna meet all the players and I'm going to use that I'm
MCDM-924||not gonna stream them so you're not just gonna be able to sit there and watch us play for four hours not yet I think
MCDM-925||we'll probably get there but in the first instance I'm just gonna put a camera on the players a camera on me and
MCDM-926||I'm going to record the sessions and then I'm going to cut them down and use them as b-roll for future videos so
MCDM-927||we'll be able to actually talk about the meat and potatoes of running the game as I am doing it actual lessons from the
MCDM-928||table rather than some of this abstract Theory stuff but it's gonna take me about a week I think to figure out how
MCDM-929||to bring the two groups together we might play this week stay tuned that's it for this episode next episode I think
MCDM-930||is going to be one for the players I've talked about doing this before I want to do a welcome to D&D episode that is just
MCDM-931||for new players because I think there are a lot of unspoken unwritten assumptions that reading The Player's
MCDM-932||Handbook or reading the basic rules will not explain a lot of things we take for granted and
MCDM-933||want to kind of pull the veil back and explain those things until next time peace out
MCDM-934||wait wait wait wait no no no don't go I don't go I don't go I don't I'm here I'm here everything's fine everything's fine
MCDM-935||we're all we're all fine down here how are you everybody Matt Koval here I know it's been like a month since the last
MCDM-936||video I hope it won't be a month before the next one but I'm still super busy I'm about 3/4 of the way through the
MCDM-937||secret project and then on to the stronghold rules but once all that stuff is wrapped up we're gonna go back to
MCDM-938||making lots of Dena tea videos I promise I'm just super busy and I hope you'll put up with it for a little while longer
MCDM-939||if you want to keep tabs on me and what I'm doing come follow me on Twitter or my subreddit slash are slash Matt Koval
MCDM-940||there'll be links in the doobly-doo I just posted a long thread on reddit saying hey here's what I've been up to
MCDM-941||just FYI keeping people abreast of what's going on I know I said the next video is going to be prepping an
MCDM-942||adventure but that is a very production heavy video I already started working on it but it means me spending a lot of
MCDM-943||time recording my process recording my screen and then going back and editing all of it and doing voiceover for it and
MCDM-944||so that's probably that's not this video and it might be the next video we'll see this video is a sequel to an earlier
MCDM-945||video and it's prompted by me texting a friend of mine and asking him what the days of the week in his campaign are
MCDM-946||called and he responded and said I don't know I never really thought about it that surprised me only because he's been
MCDM-947||working on this campaign setting for like 20 years and from my point of view at that point you should have probably
MCDM-948||figured out what your calendar is but that just betrays the difference between the kind of game he runs the kind of
MCDM-949||game I run this video is about time and specific as of that time it's specifically about calendars and the
MCDM-950||usage and tracking of time and we're gonna start with a statement a somewhat controversial statement made back in the
MCDM-951||70s by the progenitor of our hobby Gary Gygax Gary Gygax had a lot of different and often contradictory things about
MCDM-952||running and playing D&D but they only they were contradictory because he was saying them at different
MCDM-953||points in his career and there was certainly a point where Dungeons & Dragons was being challenged by
MCDM-954||third-party companies companies that weren't making an original game they were making products for Dungeons &
MCDM-955||Dragons and Gary couldn't stop them but he wanted to discourage people from buying them so he was he would say stuff
MCDM-956||like if you're not playing with official TSR products then you're not playing the real game right and then he would have
MCDM-957||to say stuff like if you're not playing with every single rule in the book then you're not playing the
MCDM-958||game because he wanted people to buy his books and on other books and it was a purely business decision I think it's
MCDM-959||safe to dismiss a lot of those statements because they came from the head of the company not the designer and
MCDM-960||Dungeon Master by and large and so much Wow super glad to be back and have machine working yeah you know I think I
MCDM-961||think we can largely ignore a lot of the stuff gary said late in his career focus on the stuff he said early in the 70s
MCDM-962||back when you could just call the dude up a lot of people did this they would just go get they didn't know how to play
MCDM-963||the game it was kind of weird it was a game unlike any other they would just go get a phone book from Wisconsin and look
MCDM-964||up Gygax comic Gary and call the dude up and he would answer and the refrain you would get from people who had talked to
MCDM-965||him and had and put questions in front of him about scenarios that came up that they didn't feel were covered the answer
MCDM-966||he would give to questions like that was well what did you do right that's how Gary thought back when he was designing
MCDM-967||the game he felt like it was his job to empower you the dungeon master to make your own rulings and then the rulings
MCDM-968||you made at your table were just as valid as the ones in the book so those of us running and playing in the 80s
MCDM-969||would hear these statements from Gary and some of them sounded super encouraging make it up what do you think
MCDM-970||and then some of them would be really dogmatic and didactic and we couldn't figure out how did the same person say
MCDM-971||all these things but later on you find out that oh these are the things he was saying when he felt like his company was
MCDM-972||under attack throw those out but one statement he made it was difficult to tell where in the spectrum it fell it
MCDM-973||was somewhat notorious caused a lot of arguments online largely I think by people who misinterpreted it this is a
MCDM-974||statement we would read this from Gary he would say in the Dungeon Master's guide from 1979 you cannot have a
MCDM-975||meaningful campaign if already this is a super controversial state right what is he gonna say I can't my campaign is
MCDM-976||worthless unless unless what if strict time records are not kept Wow what what what is he talking about
MCDM-977||because certainly lots of people have run D&D and had a lot of fun and been completely vague and you know about the
MCDM-978||time and how much time has passed and it wasn't clear when you just got that statement out of context what do you
MCDM-979||mean did he mean like tracking minutes and seconds and combat and hours or did he mean days and weeks and months as
MCDM-980||controversial as that statement is I'm gonna say maybe equally controversially that I think
MCDM-981||is basically right but that's because I'm taking the statement in the context it was meant which is back in 1979 in
MCDM-982||the Dungeon Master's guide he's talking about time in your campaign and certainly I mean I I do not follow this
MCDM-983||advice but I believe my campaign would be better if I did Gary is not talking about tracking minutes and seconds and
MCDM-984||hours he's talking about tracking days and weeks and months because the passage of time for it from his point of view
MCDM-985||and I largely agree it is the passage of time which lends drama to the events now this was more true back in 1979 where
MCDM-986||the only way apart from clerics healing you the only way to recover hitpoints was by resting and you recovered back in
MCDM-987||1979 one hit point per day and I remember my friends and I thinking well surely it's one hit point plus a
MCDM-988||constitution nope it was one hit point I think there was a rule in second edition D&E where if he didn't go anywhere if
MCDM-989||you stayed bedridden all day you would recover three hit points per day but again there was no concession made to
MCDM-990||your Constitution or anything like that so back in the day recovering hit points leaving the dungeon spending time
MCDM-991||outside of the dungeon to recover your hit points was critical to healing but even in later editions even in third or
MCDM-992||fourth or fifth edition D&D I believe that it is the passage of time that lends weight to the proceedings and I'm
MCDM-993||reminded of this when I read for instance the Lord of the Rings or I recommend a series of books by Tolkien
MCDM-994||son Christopher Tolkien called the history of the Lord of the Rings it's a three and a half volume series of books
MCDM-995||that are inside the much larger history of middle-earth and in the history of the Lord of the Rings Christopher
MCDM-996||Tolkien details the the process of writing the Lord of the Rings I should do a whole video just on that because it
MCDM-997||is fascinating but one of the things Tolkien was obsessed by and he spent a substantive percentage of his entire
MCDM-998||time writing was figuring out the calendar and the days of the week and where everyone in the Fellowship was at
MCDM-999||different points in the story this makes sense when you consider that early on in the Lord the ring was talking to
MCDM-1000||something crazy that any like writing teacher would have told him not to do and that is he splits the party he sends
MCDM-1001||half the party to Minas Tirith and he sends the other half into Mordor and he wanted a attentive player player he
MCDM-1002||wanted an attentive reader to notice and be able to tell where each group was in the process by
MCDM-1003||tracking things like the phases of the Moon now this is crazy and I do not recommend it but he wanted to know that
MCDM-1004||when Frodo and company were here on September 29th for instance the Aragorn on company
MCDM-1005||would be here and they would be seeing the same stars in the same phase of the Moon he was super worried and I'm not
MCDM-1006||sure why I don't think he needed to be he was super worried about the fact that the fellowship departed they split up
MCDM-1007||and then they get back together again and that an attentive reader might discover that this span of time was
MCDM-1008||shorter than the span of time and he would say that doesn't make any sense so tracking time and calendars and days and
MCDM-1009||weeks was super important to Tolkien and I think it is something that all of our campaigns would benefit from even though
MCDM-1010||like I said I don't do it I have done in the past and every time every campaign were I have strictly tracked time there
MCDM-1011||was a noticeable increase in the sense of reality right verisimilitude the illusion of reality because without
MCDM-1012||tracking days and weeks and months suddenly you discover that your characters have gone from first level to
MCDM-1013||ninth level but technically it's only been like seven days or you know maybe twenty days or thirty days it doesn't
MCDM-1014||matter the point is the players have this sense that surely months and maybe a year or more have passed since we work
MCDM-1015||you know farmers and sailors and mercenaries but then when you sit down and actually try to go back and review
MCDM-1016||how much time you've spent you can't account for it and it turns out that maybe you've done all this adventuring
MCDM-1017||in just a couple of days and that makes it seem less significant again this is just my opinion but it explains for
MCDM-1018||instance why I use hex a graph I showed you my maps in hex are here's one of them this is the campaign map I'm
MCDM-1019||currently using and obviously the reason I do in hex Agra fur one reason is because I'm not an artist and hex Agra
MCDM-1020||fur allows me to very quickly make what is obviously a fantasy map of my campaign and that saves me a lot of time
MCDM-1021||and it looks good enough that I'm not embarrassed to hand it out to my players that's the other thing not an artist and
MCDM-1022||I'm not a cartographer but also this using hexes helps me track time when the players say how long is it going to take
MCDM-1023||us to get from Black Bottom to or Lane I can count the number of hexes and one hacks equals one day of travel along a
MCDM-1024||road right that's the rule I use and I think I got that for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons it might be
MCDM-1025||true in I don't know probably an every edition of D&D if you're traveling along a road you go quicker than if you're
MCDM-1026||just traveling over hills and plains which are quicker than traveling through forested mountains so the rule I use is
MCDM-1027||if the players follow the road they get there one day per hex if they go over hills and plains it takes two days per
MCDM-1028||hex if they're going through forests and mountains it takes three days perhaps and obvious obviously depending on how
MCDM-1029||how much detail you prefer you can get even noodler right you can have different spans of time different for
MCDM-1030||each type of terrain you can say Oh swamps take four days and forests take three-and-a-half days or whatever that's
MCDM-1031||up to you but that sense that it's going to take the players weeks to get from point A to point B that they left the
MCDM-1032||town four or five days ago to get to the dungeon out in the middle of swamp and then they've spent three or four days
MCDM-1033||down there that accumulation of time makes it feel real helps again helps give the proceedings a sense of weight
MCDM-1034||the psychology of time is very interesting to me because something I've noticed is that players want to conserve
MCDM-1035||time when possible even though it doesn't cost them anything right if they're going along the road and they
MCDM-1036||have to travel a long distance 300 miles and it's going to take many many days to get there they will sit there and go oh
MCDM-1037||my god it's gonna take three weeks there's got to be a faster way but why if you're traveling along a safe road
MCDM-1038||the Dungeon Master is just going to say okay three weeks pass and you get there so even though it doesn't take any time
MCDM-1039||at all at the table players are always going to want to find a faster way to get there and that choice that decision
MCDM-1040||helps create drama should we go through the forest the forest is dangerous but the road goes way around will take
MCDM-1041||forever in the forest we can get through in three days so I encourage you to try it I encourage you to just try and see
MCDM-1042||as an experiment to see what it's like to actually track the amount of time it takes get a journal get a piece of paper
MCDM-1043||get a notepad or something that you stick and you're Dungeon Master's guide you pull out any time you run and just
MCDM-1044||tick off the number of days that pass I think you will find that if you go from having a purely narrative fluid game
MCDM-1045||where time is kind of up in the air and everyone kind of basically agrees it's been I don't know a couple weeks since
MCDM-1046||we left town - strictly tracking time suddenly the events become more dramatic things seem more real and that's maybe
MCDM-1047||the number one job of a dungeon master is to impress upon the players the reality of the secondary world I think
MCDM-1048||you'll also discover if you start tracking time how much time is going past that the players it might take a
MCDM-1049||month and a half or two months or three months just to get from first to third level and the characters will start
MCDM-1050||aging and that is also a fascinating process is seeing your age go up on your character sheet I played one of my
MCDM-1051||favorite characters Anthony DeVries the Paladin in my friend Brad's campaign he ran in the late 80s
MCDM-1052||and early 90s that character started off as seventeen and Brad kept strict track of time and by the time we were done by
MCDM-1053||the time my character died he was like fifteenth level I think I was like 34 or 35 and the player was still 19 years old
MCDM-1054||but that sense that my character over the course of a year and a half two years I remember how long it was about
MCDM-1055||that long had aged had gone from being a callow youth to a responsible adult leading armies was it's something that I
MCDM-1056||have often wanted to recapture for what should be obvious reasons so don't feel bad if you're not tracking time like I
MCDM-1057||said I'm not doing it right now in my campaign I'm kind of winging it I think of Matt Mercer for instance I think
MCDM-1058||basically wins it and the players there's this consensus that builds but then every once in a while time will
MCDM-1059||become important to you or the players if you haven't been tracking it strictly up until then it's gonna seem weird when
MCDM-1060||you start doing it all of a sudden because that's when people will start disagreeing regarding how much time has
MCDM-1061||gone by so give it a shot try tracking time and in order to track time here's part two of the video in order to track
MCDM-1062||time well you're gonna need a calendar and I think building a calendar is one of the most fascinating aspects of being
MCDM-1063||a dungeon master something if you haven't done I strongly encourage you to give it a shot because so much of our
MCDM-1064||culture is expressed and defined by our calendar that once you start looking into why are the months called what they
MCDM-1065||are why are the days of the week called what they are why are there how many days there are in a year you discover a
MCDM-1066||lot about our world both the physical reality of the world and the cultural reality of the world and then when you
MCDM-1067||start answering those same questions in your world you learn a lot about your world for instance our months are named
MCDM-1068||after a combination of the ninth month the tenth month the 11th month and also famous rulers
MCDM-1069||August and July right if you go back and figure out why is obvious called August you discover wasn't always called August
MCDM-1070||until there was a guy Caesar Augustus who was a Roman Emperor and they part of deifying him was naming a month after
MCDM-1071||him and Julius II Oh Emperor Julius Caesar got the same treatment so that's how we get July and August and that is
MCDM-1072||fascinating and notice we have July and August we also have September and October we have two completely different
MCDM-1073||standards for naming months and that's because human beings are not consistent they're messy the calendar changes in
MCDM-1074||unpredictable ways and studying how the calendar in the real world has changed it creates these layers in the real
MCDM-1075||world of time passing like for a long time the calendar the months were called this and then we change them at a
MCDM-1076||certain point and if you do the same thing in your world you will discover that you are inventing this history for
MCDM-1077||your world why are the months named what they were and how did that change and why and now you've created depth and
MCDM-1078||layers for your world and that is one of the fun parts of being Dungeon Master the players may never know anything
MCDM-1079||about this but you having the answers behind the screen will again you know how the sense is going to end right will
MCDM-1080||make it seem more real of course you can do what Tolkien did you can just say listen my characters don't speak English
MCDM-1081||they speak you know common the common tongue in that planet but we as players speak English so that was a conceit that
MCDM-1082||Tolkien enjoyed deploying was the idea that Frodo and Aragorn are not speaking to each other in English but what they
MCDM-1083||they're speaking to each other in you know a Western I guess or whatever it was and Tolkien was translating it into
MCDM-1084||English so obviously since they're not speaking English they aren't referring to the English days of the week or the
MCDM-1085||English months so Tolkien translated those so in the Lord of the Rings he talks about events happening in August
MCDM-1086||or in July or on a Monday or on a Friday right and you understand well they don't have the same calendar we have a Tolkien
MCDM-1087||has translated for us of course you can do the same thing you can say listen I don't want to spend hours or days coming
MCDM-1088||up with a calendar that's plausible I'm just going to use but I do want to keep strict time records I do want to try
MCDM-1089||that so just use the real world calendar and that has the advantage of your players understand it when you say oh
MCDM-1090||the shipment is going to arrive at the docks that the smugglers are going to drop off the ship and on a Friday right
MCDM-1091||next Friday the players understand what that means and they can ask what day is it right
MCDM-1092||now you can say oh it's Tuesday and a players understand what that means so that's kind of the tier 1 solution right
MCDM-1093||tier 0 is don't track time right which is what a lot of us are doing right now but tier 1 is track time but just use a
MCDM-1094||regular mundane calendar again that has the advantage of being known and comprehensible to your players but then
MCDM-1095||if you decide to invent your own calendar it has the disadvantage of your players don't know what that calendar
MCDM-1096||means and every time you mention a day of the week or a month they're gonna have to go to some handout you've given
MCDM-1097||them and translate and figure out what day is that how many days away is that how many
MCDM-1098||months away is that from now but it does have the advantage of seeming real of making your worlds seem like it has more
MCDM-1099||depth and also conveying certain ideas about how your cultures think of and reference time for instance there are 12
MCDM-1100||typically 12 or 13 months in the typical earth year because that is linked to the cycle of the moon well how many moons
MCDM-1101||does your world have doesn't even have moons you know does it have a moon like ours or does it have more than one moon
MCDM-1102||and one of the phases of those moons suddenly now you're getting to some really interesting questions about the
MCDM-1103||cosmology of your world not just the cultures but the physical reality of it our world has 365 days does yours why
MCDM-1104||why don't have 360 Wow the Babylonians would have been a lot happier if the earth took 3 exactly 360 days to go
MCDM-1105||around the Sun but of course we don't have 360 days it's messy it's 365 and a bit and technically I think that number
MCDM-1106||changes over the course of centuries or millennia so now you've got a grapple with how often how long does it take for
MCDM-1107||your world to go around its Sun and what do you do with those little rounding errors you know a lot of old calendars
MCDM-1108||had this idea that there were some days that don't belong to any month they would have like feasting days or
MCDM-1109||holidays that would just exist between two months and just floated there I had their own name and that was completely
MCDM-1110||unambiguous everyone knew that if you were talking about midwinter for instance that was this day that took
MCDM-1111||place between these two months and didn't belong to any month what year is it in your world we track time obviously
MCDM-1112||from the birth of Christ right which we've now kind of historians trying to remove a certain kind of bias from
MCDM-1113||calendars now call the Common Era and before the Common Era but of course that's completely
MCDM-1114||arbitrary every civilizations calendar has to pick some arbitrary point to start from and what point they pick is
MCDM-1115||fascinating because that tells you what's important to them right what year you start counting from tells your
MCDM-1116||players that something important happened that many years ago and that import that thing was important to these
MCDM-1117||people in this world this culture when you pick a year for your campaign to happen and let's pick a random here
MCDM-1118||let's say that your campaign takes place in the year 378 you just told your players something important happened 378
MCDM-1119||years ago it specifically something important to these people in the culture the campaign is taking place in what was
MCDM-1120||it what happened 378 years ago I have no idea but I really want to know don't you a lot of dictators in the real world
MCDM-1121||have decided have renamed the calendar and started that Year Zero to say this is the year of the revolution and work
MCDM-1122||hours start we're throwing out all the old stuff and starting new a lot of civilizations didn't keep a constant
MCDM-1123||record of years they would reset every time there was a new king or a new emperor and there was okay this is the
MCDM-1124||16th year of this king or Emperor's reign and you just knew everyone who grew up in that era knew that this king
MCDM-1125||ruled after this king who ruled after this king it was just in the common memory so when you referred to the 17th
MCDM-1126||year of this Kings reign everyone knew how long ago that was even though we now looking back on a calendar like that
MCDM-1127||would have to do a bunch of math but the people who lived back then didn't have to do that kind of math they just knew
MCDM-1128||why are there seven days in a week that's a good question when you start asking these questions you start
MCDM-1129||discovering that some of these things are completely arbitrary right you could certainly have you know ten days in a
MCDM-1130||week if you wanted to depending on how your months work and how many divisions of a month you want to have but then
MCDM-1131||other measurements are not entirely arbitrary like a year is a real the earth really does go around the Sun and
MCDM-1132||tracking one revolution around the Sun is not arbitrary but it's certainly not a physical constant it's always
MCDM-1133||fascinating to go online and research other calendars and see how other civilizations in the real world tried to
MCDM-1134||track time for instance I remember the French after the during the Revolution the French kind of went a little insane
MCDM-1135||with like the metric system and rationality and we're gonna have a perfectly rational world and they tried
MCDM-1136||to have a metric calendar for a little while I don't think it really worked out and but they I love this one idea where
MCDM-1137||they decided to name every day of the year with like a unique name right so like August 17th might be called lamp I
MCDM-1138||just picked a random and they and actually they ran out of good dramatic words pretty quickly it had to come up
MCDM-1139||with all sorts of crazy like like June 18th is bread or whatever but the result of that was somebody could say well when
MCDM-1140||were you born and you might say I was born in bread in 1970 and they would know that bread was this one specific
MCDM-1141||day that's actually a pretty cool idea so what are the names of the days of the week how many weeks are there in your
MCDM-1142||month why are there 12 months are the 13 months are there 360 days or the 365 days how long does it take your world to
MCDM-1143||go around the Sun how many moons does it have these are all fascinating questions and as you go to the process of
MCDM-1144||answering them you learn a lot about your world I have my calendar I put my calendar in the doobly-doo that I use
MCDM-1145||for my game and I put a lot of work into it and what I did for this campaign was I went into our world and looked at our
MCDM-1146||months and other calendars in medieval Europe that are not the typical like Roman calendar and what they named
MCDM-1147||months of the year and then came up with my own kind of versions of those so if you know what the words of my calendar
MCDM-1148||mean you know why that month was named that but that's just one way to do it you could very easily just make up names
MCDM-1149||right I think that's one of the two basic divisions of how to do a fantasy world is you just make stuff up and I
MCDM-1150||think a lot of like the Forgotten Realms just sounds like they made up a bunch of words and many of which don't sound to
MCDM-1151||me like they could be plausible words and that's one of the criticisms I have against the Forgotten Realms but it's
MCDM-1152||still a setting that I have played a lot in and then also there's the I'm gonna try and replicate the real world and try
MCDM-1153||to figure out why were things in a real world called what they were and then come up with my own versions of those
MCDM-1154||neither of those is better than the other there are virtues to both of them
MCDM-1155||certainly the virtue of the Forgotten Realms was it's easy just make up 13 cool sounding names and those are your
MCDM-1156||months I think you'll find if you make your own calendar not only is it kind of fun also you get the opportunity to then
MCDM-1157||hand it out to your players and once you've done that some of your players will be like ooh
MCDM-1158||they will think it's neat they will enjoy using your hand out their own personal version of your calendar to
MCDM-1159||track when they left the city when they arrived in town how long they spent in the dungeon their copy of your calendar
MCDM-1160||will become their own idiosyncratic Journal of your game that is also fun it's fun for them as
MCDM-1161||players it's also neat for you as the dungeon master if you're like me and you're running Dungeons & Dragons and
MCDM-1162||you're not keeping track of time I encourage you to give it a shot give it some thought
MCDM-1163||and I think you will find that it does lend the proceedings more weight I'll put a link in the doobly-doo to a great
MCDM-1164||tool you can use to build your own fantasy calendar you tell it how many days of the week there are in your world
MCDM-1165||and what the names of the days are did Oh months and it will build a calendar for you I did mine in Excel and I did it
MCDM-1166||because I wanted to have certain days a certain number of days that didn't belong to any month although I liked the
MCDM-1167||idea that hundreds of years in the future of my campaign eventually this period will be called a month called
MCDM-1168||like midwinter or something like that and you get this sense at least I like having this sense of the language
MCDM-1169||changing over time that's something that is a hallmark of my campaign and if you have player decides to actually try to
MCDM-1170||figure out why things are called what they're called they learn things about the world I like tracking for instance
MCDM-1171||when the spring and autumnal equinox are equinox is a latin word meaning equal night they're the two days a year where
MCDM-1172||there's as much exactly as much daylight as there is nighttime and now we're starting to get into celestial mechanics
MCDM-1173||and we start thinking about things like what is the sky in your world look like not only how many moons are there but
MCDM-1174||what are the constellations and I love stuff like that you could even say that there are a number of constellations
MCDM-1175||equal to the number of months in your world and they're named after the constellations that notion of what do
MCDM-1176||people see when they look up in the sky to me is a fascinating question and the answers are culturally revealing that's
MCDM-1177||the second video on time folks consider making a calendar no pressure obviously it can't be that important
MCDM-1178||because I don't do it I don't think Matt Mercer does it but I know I have done in the past and the campaign's where I have
MCDM-1179||kept track of time I do feel as though the the campaign was more meaningful the characters progression and
MCDM-1180||accomplishments were more meaningful and so I encourage you to give a shot lots of stuff has happened since the last
MCDM-1181||video unfortunately it's all happening behind the scenes like I said I'm about three-quarters of the way through the
MCDM-1182||secret project and then when that's done we're going to move on to me working on finishing the stronghold rules the rules
MCDM-1183||and charts and all that are all done I just have to write up what everything means and then I'm also building like I
MCDM-1184||said a multi-camera studio because I want to stream D&D again except I want to look good
MCDM-1185||and be easy and fun and maybe have some innovations regarding how we deal with stuff like twitch chat and that takes
MCDM-1186||time I spend about one day a week now with my friend Jerry my producer working on the setup for the studio and testing
MCDM-1187||new technology people send me stuff I got this fantastic campaign guide in the mail from somebody older than me who's
MCDM-1188||been running D&D since before I started running and who had gotten burned out on it because of that we get together on
MCDM-1189||game night and we play D&D because that's what we do on Thursday nights and he saw my West marches video and was
MCDM-1190||blown away it's funny because I had a couple people say I watch the whole video I still don't know what a West
MCDM-1191||marches campaign is I think they're expecting a more complex answer than the real answer which is it's just a
MCDM-1192||campaign that is run basically by the players there is no specific game night it's up to the players to decide where
MCDM-1193||they're going to go and what they're going to do and who they're going to play with they self organize and then
MCDM-1194||tell you we want to play this Tuesday night me and Bob and Carol and Doug and then you say okay I will have the
MCDM-1195||adventure ready that Tuesday so it's you reacting to the players rather than the other way around and that style of play
MCDM-1196||caused this game master to completely revolutionize this game and have a lot of fun he sent me his campaign setting
MCDM-1197||which I read big chunks of I thought was fantastic reminds me to reading this run minded me to a certain extent of reading
MCDM-1198||the arguing grimoire when I was a kid which if you don't know what that is well maybe we'll do a series of videos
MCDM-1199||on the arguing grimoire I also got a whole bunch of these in the mail like 50 of these coupons for M&Ms because one of
MCDM-1200||my viewers works at Mars mmm and said hey I just wanted to say thank you and sent me a whole bunch of coupons so we
MCDM-1201||have a whole bunch of like M&Ms and Twix game night now because of that thank you very much I also got this in the mail I
MCDM-1202||don't know exactly what it is or who sent it or why but you know I don't pretty sure I didn't kickstart this so
MCDM-1203||this is something that when I have more time I will check out it's like book on game mastery it's got a bunch of a got a
MCDM-1204||couple of dungeons it's got traps and puzzles in it people ask me about puzzles all the time and that's
MCDM-1205||something that don't have any advice on anytime I've ever needed a puzzle I kind of just made one up on the spot and it
MCDM-1206||either worked or didn't work I used to use grim truth grim tooths traps but those are kind of real old-school
MCDM-1207||funhouse dungeon traps I'm not sure I could recommend them to a modern Dungeon Master and I
MCDM-1208||also remember the book of challenges from 3rd edition DD if you're looking for trap like encounters the book of
MCDM-1209||challenges has some pretty cool ones in it but when I need a puzzle I do the same thing you do I go online I look for
MCDM-1210||stuff I try things out I made up a chessboard puzzle once that was really cool and really effective I just again I
MCDM-1211||I I don't think I really know anything about making puzzles I've always thought that puzzles belong in D&D they give you
MCDM-1212||that sense of a earlier fantastic powerful world with mages that could bend reality and create these puzzle
MCDM-1213||trap things that's a neat part of the history of D&D but certainly you can run an entire game without any puzzles it's
MCDM-1214||my hope that the next video will be the prepping an adventure and you get to watch me go through the process of
MCDM-1215||prepping against the cult of the reptile God because I think it's a great adventure and I think watching me how I
MCDM-1216||prep an adventure is going to be somewhat enlightening I get the the spoiler is that it's you're going to
MCDM-1217||learn that less is more and that for me the process of prepping an adventure is largely just just trying to decipher
MCDM-1218||what's in the adventure and what do I actually have to read and pay attention to because a lot of the information in
MCDM-1219||adventure I think is is nonsense you can skip the folks who write adventures I think have a lot in common with other
MCDM-1220||kinds of writers in that they make the mistake of thinking that the reader has to understand everything I know about
MCDM-1221||this adventure in order to appreciate my brilliance and so they front-load the adventure with all this history that the
MCDM-1222||new player thinks they have to read and understand but usually that history is pretty meaningless and doesn't actually
MCDM-1223||come up in the adventure as written and you can skip it and that's something I have learned over decades of running the
MCDM-1224||game may not be obvious to a new player so watching me prep an adventure is I think largely going to be figuring out
MCDM-1225||what stuff I throw out at ignore and what stuff I actually pay attention to that's your tiny microscopic preview of
MCDM-1226||the next video as usual I don't have a patreon there are no ads in front of my D&D videos although I did have somebody
MCDM-1227||on reddit say Matt you should you should turn on ads for your videos and I was like oh no I don't think I'm gonna do
MCDM-1228||that because ads I think are really annoying mostly because the ads they put in front of videos are not ads for
MCDM-1229||things you are going to want to click on or buy if I had if I had some belief that the ads
MCDM-1230||that would be turned on were ads for things that you wanted I would be a lot more comfortable turning to mom because
MCDM-1231||that's what I want I want ads that are actually for things I buy I'm like the I'm a you know a deeply American
MCDM-1232||consumer when it comes to like spending money I spend lots of money on lots of frivolous stuff like all this stuff for
MCDM-1233||making videos for instance and I would love it if the ads I saw were tailored for the stuff I buy but of course
MCDM-1234||they're not and so it'll turning on ads is just an annoyance and they don't make that much money you tube tells you how
MCDM-1235||much money you would be making from ads if you turn them on and the answer is not much I make way more selling books
MCDM-1236||and the books or things I own and make and people fall in love with them and want more and that makes me want to make
MCDM-1237||more videos and write more books so it's a great ecology and I have no plans to really ever turn on ads if I can at all
MCDM-1238||avoid it I think I can as long as you folks buy books so come by my Amazon page there's a link in the doobly-doo
MCDM-1239||I've written two fantasy novels I haven't done really any work on the third one for a while because I've got
MCDM-1240||the I've got dungeon here's the list of stuff first of all I have a job I have a full-time job work at Turtle Rock
MCDM-1241||Studios and we're doing lots of cool stuff that I'm proud of and can't wait to share with you folks a lot you know
MCDM-1242||really I think interesting and innovative game spaces that were exploring and then after that I run
MCDM-1243||Dungeons & Dragons every week and that takes you know not only one of my evenings but typically about half my
MCDM-1244||weekend to prep for and then I would like to make more D&D videos and that usually takes a day to record and edit
MCDM-1245||and then I'm working on the top-secret project which is a lot of fun and I'm enjoying it's some of the most vital
MCDM-1246||work I've done recently I can't wait to share it with you but again that takes a lot of time and then on top of that I'm
MCDM-1247||going to do stronghold rules and I'm building a D&D studio and our streaming studio and all sorts of nonsense so
MCDM-1248||unfortunately not a lot of time has been spent on the third novel but the first two novels I think are a lot of fun and
MCDM-1249||if you like Dungeons & Dragons on this channel I think you would probably like them check them out that's it folks
MCDM-1250||thanks for being patient it's probably going to be another couple of weeks before you get a video but by that time
MCDM-1251||I should be done with the secret project moving on to the stronghold rules which everybody wants and we're gonna have the
MCDM-1252||Battle of castle rend next week in my campaign those of you who were following the campaign Diaries it's my hope that
MCDM-1253||we will at some point get caught up maybe with a big livestream where I got all the players
MCDM-1254||the other we talk about everything this happened since last campaign Diary I know that's not exactly what people want
MCDM-1255||but it would be fun and it's something that I can actually get done right we can spend two hours talking about what
MCDM-1256||happened in the game since last we left our heroes and it will culminate with two armies showing up at Nicodemus
MCDM-1257||castle lord Saxton's army and then ladies Ariel's army of the undead and the hero's attempts to fight them
MCDM-1258||off and that will be using my warfare system which is the sequel to my stronghold system both of these are
MCDM-1259||systems I've been using for quite a while they just need to be adapted for fifth edition and I'm super looking
MCDM-1260||forward to that come by my twitter feed there's link in the doobly-doo if you want to see photographs of the game
MCDM-1261||every Thursday when we play we take pictures and upload them my friend Anna who plays a hundred in Modesto the bar
MCDM-1262||the Rioja and bard she often live tweets the game as we play it it's all it's a blast her gift game is strong so I know
MCDM-1263||there have been a lot of videos but there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes and I think become you know
MCDM-1264||like was April May June somewhere late May early June there'll be a flood of new content and you'd be like holy crap
MCDM-1265||I'm getting sick of Matt Koval how do you think I feel I have to live with the guy until next time folks have a good
MCDM-1266||time peace out  
MCDM-1267||there was a moment early in my current D&D campaign where one of the players was behaving in a manner contrary to the
MCDM-1268||well-being of the party nails the team's sorcerer played by my friend tom was suddenly exhibiting
MCDM-1269||godlike powers and has his power grew his humanity evaporated at one point nails grew impatient with an NPC the
MCDM-1270||wizard butts and the NPC exploded no spell was cast there was no rule in the players handbook that granted a sorcerer
MCDM-1271||of this power he just did it one of the other players Anna wanted Tom to just explain what was happening with his
MCDM-1272||character when Tom offered no explanation and I got frustrated she was slowly realizing that tom was not on
MCDM-1273||their side she even said this sucks what is going on she was frustrated but she was slowly realizing along with the rest
MCDM-1274||of the party that part of their current adventure one of the challenges they had to solve was what to do about nails I
MCDM-1275||think maybe the biggest problem through all this was the fact that the players many of whom were new had a hard time
MCDM-1276||contextualizing their reactions in character having been through all this once I don't think they'd had that same
MCDM-1277||problem again it's one of the more dramatic things that's happened in the campaign it was crazy it was cool it was
MCDM-1278||fun it was memorable the players had to figure out how do we stop nails and they had a few different tools they could use
MCDM-1279||good ideas and it played out in a way that was close to what I expected what with some interesting twists I was able
MCDM-1280||to do this highly narrative dramatic plotline because I collaborated with Tom Tom originally had an entirely different
MCDM-1281||character of mind boots but I said hey go watch the original series Star Trek episode where no man has gone before and
MCDM-1282||tell me what you think he watched it that day and reported back that it was cool and I said how about we do that Tom
MCDM-1283||hadn't really played D&D before and so he was excited at the possibility that the hobby could contain such nonsense he
MCDM-1284||didn't know in other words how weird and non-standard this is I explained it would mean
MCDM-1285||creating an entire fake character I was collaborating with Tom apart from the other players I was sort of bringing him
MCDM-1286||behind diem screen with me on purpose to create a dramatic moment that probably couldn't
MCDM-1287||have happened any other way everybody Matt Koval here you know we've covered a lot of ground in the running
MCDM-1288||the game series and I'm always thinking about what kind of advice to give new DMS but I think this counts very much as
MCDM-1289||next-level DM techniques not something you want to try your first time running because it relies on you relying on
MCDM-1290||another player to play their part if I just gave this power to Tom with no price no explanation and no discussion
MCDM-1291||outside the game the players including Tom would spend their time trying to figure out how to tame this power how to
MCDM-1292||keep it but that's not drama that's min maxing Phoenix is way more powerful than Marvel girl she's so
MCDM-1293||powerful she renders the rest of the x-men obsolete and that's okay because the author knows dark Phoenix is coming
MCDM-1294||and dark Phoenix is a problem to solve that was the core of my discussion with Tom I told him no matter what nails his
MCDM-1295||power could not be controlled you know maybe he could be cured that's reasonable but that kind of solution
MCDM-1296||requires time and resources it means research and that was not on the table many people watching were
MCDM-1297||disappointed the whole thing resolved itself in only a couple of episodes they wanted the problem to grow over weeks
MCDM-1298||and months but as soon as the players feel like they're in control of the situation if they felt like they could
MCDM-1299||ignore the problem with nails until they got back to civilization if they felt like they had the time to do research
MCDM-1300||and experiment then the drama dies drama requires tension and in this scenario the tension is the ticking clock nails
MCDM-1301||as power grows his humanity fades if you had more time if you were in capital and you could see a powerful wizard well you
MCDM-1302||might be able to cure him but you do not have time you do not have resources you're going to have to do something
MCDM-1303||desperate that is drama pushing the players past their comfort zone or the only choices they have to make is which
MCDM-1304||goblin to attack and really forcing them to think outside the box this isn't that different from just playing out a
MCDM-1305||character's backstory lots of players enjoy making characters with a dark secrets that will play out over the
MCDM-1306||course of the campaign which only the DM and the player know about it's a big part of what makes the
MCDM-1307||secondary world feel like a real place each of the players has the potential to know something about the world that the
MCDM-1308||other players don't just like the real world as Tom played nails is growing power and loss of humanity I was able to
MCDM-1309||sort of sit back and watch this was amazing to me as tom was a completely new player and I realized that what
MCDM-1310||we're doing when we collaborate with a player to create some dramatic moment or arc is we're promoting the player to the
MCDM-1311||sort of quasi DM role Tom playing Omega nails has to react to the other players exactly the same way I would if I were
MCDM-1312||playing an NPC and this gets to the collaborative element of all role playing there is always in every RPG
MCDM-1313||session that element of playing along even if the players don't know it there is an unspoken or maybe spoken agreement
MCDM-1314||that the players will play along with whatever adventure the DM has ready within reason in a sense the players are
MCDM-1315||already sort of acting as little mini DMS they are not always only ever interested in what would my character do
MCDM-1316||they are also interested even if they aren't thinking about it in party cohesion and drama and keeping the flow
MCDM-1317||of the adventure moving it may seem radical or dangerous to bring a player more toward the DM side of the game
MCDM-1318||asking them to collaborate with you to create drama but it should not seem radical it is perfectly ordinary for a
MCDM-1319||player to include hooks in their backstory the DM can use to create drama what happens when the assassin who
MCDM-1320||killed their parents shows up in that scenario the player definitely knows things about
MCDM-1321||this new mysterious assassin that the other players don't know which they may not reveal in these strict service of
MCDM-1322||problem-solving and overcoming the challenge they may choose to reveal what they know about this enemy assassin when
MCDM-1323||it best serves the narrative so I say it's a very small leap from that which is normal to the player shifting even
MCDM-1324||farther over to the DM side and collaborating to create a dramatic beat you the DM take the player aside and
MCDM-1325||pitch them on this dramatic arc your pitch is not just an idea hey it would be neat if we collaborated together to
MCDM-1326||create some cool drama it needs a structure when we launch to the chain I wanted to start with a bang
MCDM-1327||so I busted out the same hook I used when I ran this campaign at pandemic studios for the mercenaries design team
MCDM-1328||I took two of the players aside in this case Lars and Phil the two players I thought
MCDM-1329||would naturally gravitate toward the commander role and I just asked them hey which of you is gonna be the commander
MCDM-1330||they talked about it and they agreed on Phil so I said okay Lars here's my pitch you're going to make a fake character
MCDM-1331||the commander and Phil is going to be the lieutenant then in the first episode you are fake character is killed and
MCDM-1332||Phil's lieutenant becomes commander they loved that idea the other players had no idea any of this was happening this was
MCDM-1333||an easy plot to play out because it was all going to happen in the first combat I didn't really need Lars or Phil to do
MCDM-1334||anything except play their characters I told him let me worry about how Lars is fake character dies so they didn't have
MCDM-1335||anything to do except play D&D normally they didn't know about realm they didn't know ajax was going to show up all of
MCDM-1336||their reactions to that were perfectly authentic the setup with nails was much more complex I was lucky because Tom
MCDM-1337||very much wanted to serve the drama he wasn't interested in gaming the system he was able to take the guidelines I set
MCDM-1338||out and be creative within those boundaries we talked a lot about what nails could do I gave him certain beats
MCDM-1339||to hit like detonating a junior officer and we would talk about it and then during the session I'd message him to
MCDM-1340||let him know now is the time we talked about how his power was going to grow in stages and what the limits of his power
MCDM-1341||were at each stage stage one you can cast your spell's without using spell slots pretty straightforward didn't
MCDM-1342||require a lot of role-playing from Tom by the time he got to stage three his power was basically limitless so we had
MCDM-1343||this plan certain moments how his power would grow and what he would do with it but when confronted by the other players
MCDM-1344||that was all Tom it was up to him to play the part he improvised stuff like being able to command the somnium to
MCDM-1345||neveress with his mind he invented the idea that he could just know where everything and everyone on the ship was
MCDM-1346||meanwhile I invented the idea that like dr. Manhattan nails could be in two places at once
MCDM-1347||I didn't tell Tom I was going to do that he was as surprised as everyone else when angel reported it and said they had
MCDM-1348||won the battle against the duo are below decks because nails was down their fire balling everyone but nails was here some
MCDM-1349||of the players said those moments where tom is hearing about some crazy stuff his character did and didn't
MCDM-1350||know about it are so unique to D&D in that moment tom was still a player still reacting to my nonsense but instead of
MCDM-1351||reacting in a manner designed to resolve drama which is what the players are normally trying to do he was reacting in
MCDM-1352||a manner designed to increase it now your first reaction may be that takes putting a lot of trust in your players
MCDM-1353||yes that's that's the point first of all it might not work just because a player thinks it's a cool idea it doesn't mean
MCDM-1354||it will go off without a hitch but this is D&D it's not open-heart surgery there aren't lives on the line if an idea
MCDM-1355||excites you and you share it with a player and they're excited that's reason enough to try it and if it doesn't work
MCDM-1356||running one of a million reasons that doesn't mean it was a bad idea it might work next time I've never had a
MCDM-1357||player not want to collaborate with me to create a moment they are always excited and eager to try it my friend
MCDM-1358||Steve Howard ran a DC heroes game in which I played a speedster a flash type character named mister in between it was
MCDM-1359||set in Long Beach and the players were each going to invent a member of a now-defunct superhero team the team
MCDM-1360||broke up years ago after the group's leader was murdered under mysterious circumstances
MCDM-1361||he asked each of us to tell him privately why our character was responsible for killing the group's
MCDM-1362||leader he would then pick which of our stories was the real reason it was a great setup because it meant we each had
MCDM-1363||to invent a character with a reason to kill our old leader but only one of us or maybe none of us actually did it very
MCDM-1364||Agatha Christie I emailed Steven said I killed our old leader because my character is actually a robotic
MCDM-1365||duplicate of the original mister in between I was created by one of our old arch-nemesis placed on the team secretly
MCDM-1366||and no one knows what happened to the original mister in between i bided my time until our leader was weak and alone
MCDM-1367||and I killed him Steve loved that idea but he said no no you didn't kill him you were nowhere near the place you are
MCDM-1368||a robotic duplicate of the original mister in between and you were put on the team to kill the team's leader but
MCDM-1369||someone else beat you to the punch and your programming didn't account for this so you've spent the last three years
MCDM-1370||continuing to be mister in between you're in this limbo where the trigger you were created to
MCDM-1371||pull cannot now ever be pulled infinite loop we played for a couple of months some external threat possibly related to
MCDM-1372||the death of our old leader has got the team back together we don't exactly trust each other but we all want to know
MCDM-1373||the truth about what happened years ago I enjoy dropping these little hints into the game that my character wasn't human
MCDM-1374||I'd suggest logical but absurd solutions to some problems and then as the team got closer to the truth the real mr.
MCDM-1375||in-between showed up he changed his identity become another hero whom we'd met and dealt with and in a critical
MCDM-1376||moment he pulled off his mask revealing my face confronting the heroes about who he was and who I was this was an
MCDM-1377||incredibly memorable moment my friends I still talk about it 20 years later as I tried to convince them I was me and the
MCDM-1378||GM tried to convince them he was me like the problem with nails the players didn't know what to do they were sort of
MCDM-1379||lost at sea they could no longer rely on their character sheets to solve the problem they had to think and make a
MCDM-1380||decision on imperfect datum that is drama Steve and I had talked about this this robot I was playing was actually a
MCDM-1381||villain and therefore has enormous power enough power to take on the entire group he's pretending to be this other
MCDM-1382||character and so is balanced with their power level but if the ruse is ever discovered he would drop the act and use
MCDM-1383||all his power he could kill the entire team role playing in character all of us arguing about who the real mister in
MCDM-1384||between was was memorable but not as memorable as what happened when combat broke out and my character revealed
MCDM-1385||himself to be a robot in disguise when initiative was called the players thought they were going to watch me and
MCDM-1386||this doppelganger fight but in the middle of the combat I turned on the heroes and Steve and I traded character
MCDM-1387||sheets he gave me the PC version of my hero and I gave him the robotic villain version of my hero and I took over the
MCDM-1388||role-playing smoothly transitioning into making the same arguments and using the same dialogue Steve had been doing
MCDM-1389||because I was now playing that character how badass is this role-playing games everyone it's the most fun you could
MCDM-1390||have with your brain if you can get your players on your side collaborating with you to create drama then you can do
MCDM-1391||almost anything I'm not going to this always plays out without a hitch sometimes it does but you can't count on
MCDM-1392||that what plans of ours do go off without a hitch to me the surprises the things I
MCDM-1393||never thought of like sweet sacrificing himself to stop nails because Phil really really wanted to play a gift
MCDM-1394||Yankee is what makes the game fun but collaborating with a player to create a dramatic moment with a satisfying
MCDM-1395||conclusion does take more work than normal DMing because there are more moving parts this is why I think this is
MCDM-1396||advanced deeming one of the reasons I wanted to open the chain of Akron campaign with some player collaboration
MCDM-1397||I wanted to show people the game can be a lot more than just the DM describes the challenge the players try to solve
MCDM-1398||it we have the freedom to blur those lines in really interesting ways but it requires some experience guiding
MCDM-1399||characters and working with your players I've never really done this with more than one or two players at a time I
MCDM-1400||think it's important that you limit the number of variables the number of things that can go wrong to one or maybe two of
MCDM-1401||your players plus doing it with all of your players would be weird who in that scenario is reacting authentically
MCDM-1402||although now that I think of it I am reminded of one classic paranoia adventure and it's rare that I do this
MCDM-1403||more than once in a campaign although the chain of Akron is an exception I think the fear for some people is that
MCDM-1404||once you've had a moment like this how will the players know any given scenario isn't a setup with a player collaborated
MCDM-1405||to create drama no they don't but this I think is more problem for the audience watching a stream than the actual
MCDM-1406||players since the god factor scenario with nails none of the players have ever questioned is this another one of those
MCDM-1407||scenarios there was a point at lunch with the whole group where I just explained flat-out tom is collaborating
MCDM-1408||with me for this the challenge is how are the rest of you going to solve the problem of nails I have no problem just
MCDM-1409||explicitly stating the nature of a challenge in a very meta how would the characters know that sense because the
MCDM-1410||players are not their characters and sometimes pulling the curtain back removes frustration while preserving
MCDM-1411||drama I can't tell you step by step how to do this because the solution is going to be totally unique to your scenario
MCDM-1412||but I've given you three examples me and nails me and the commander of the chain and Steve and I in his superhero game
MCDM-1413||like a lot of my advice just being aware this as possible is most of what you need but remember that you and your
MCDM-1414||candidate player can sit down talk about what you want to happen explore ideas and then key certain moments to triggers
MCDM-1415||I'll text you when it's time for you to reveal yourself oh I've also given you a fourth example
MCDM-1416||if you remember the DM keeping control of the triggers it was up to Steve to decide when the real mr. McQueen was
MCDM-1417||going to confront us means you're still in control of the pacing of the adventure and that's important don't try
MCDM-1418||this on your first time out it's super common to want to do everything cool all in one go but as you get to know your
MCDM-1419||players and their characters you'll come up with some cool ideas and you'll know which of your players is the best
MCDM-1420||candidate it might not work but if it does i 100% guarantee you it will become one of the most talked-about
MCDM-1421||and remembered parts of your game thanks for watching everybody that is the player collaboration video just one of
MCDM-1422||the tricks I use to create drama and make the game memorable we've taken a break from the chain of Akron we've been
MCDM-1423||playing in my friend Phil's game and streaming it live on Wednesday nights for the past of three weeks but next
MCDM-1424||week the Wednesday after this video goes up we will be back to me being behind the screen and we will continue with the
MCDM-1425||exploration of ring well if you like this video and you want to support this channel we do have a patreon you can
MCDM-1426||come by I post my notes for my D&D campaign before we run on Wednesday nights we've also got a store where you
MCDM-1427||can pick up a new t-shirt designed by Tom schmuck and of course strongholds and followers
MCDM-1428||available in print and PDF we are getting ready for the next Kickstarter if you want an alert when the kingdoms
MCDM-1429||in warfare Kickstarter goes live there is a link in the doobly-doo if you're looking for advice on running the game
MCDM-1430||we have a great an active discord there are links to all our social stuff in the doobly-doo until next time peace out
MCDM-1431||Hey, everybody, I had  a great idea for starting this episode about the D.M. Screen by having me sitting behind the D.M. Screen.
MCDM-1432||but unfortunately, my mic is right here, and when I put the D.M. Screen up like this, all the sudden I sound like I'm at the bottom of a well. so that is not the most...Wait, I have an idea, hang on one second.
MCDM-1433||Hey! There we go! Fantastic. Okay, so how was I going to...oh When last we left our heroes...See that's how you can tell D&D has started,
MCDM-1434||we're not talking about movies or work anymore. I am sitting behind the D.M.'s Screen, and I say "When last we left our heroes." Okay, we can get rid of this.
MCDM-1435||This week we're going to talk about the Dungeon Master's Screen. About why some people use one and why some people don't. We'll talk about some of the history of it and
MCDM-1436||some options as a D.M. when it comes to choosing your D.M. Screen. Yes, there is more than one choice. So, you saw how I begin my D&D game.
MCDM-1437||I say, "When last we left our heroes." And the players know, "Oh hey, it's time to play." It's a tradition of mine, and the players like it.
MCDM-1438||I used to, then, recap what happened the week before, but I don't do that anymore. Because one of the things that I noticed was that when the D.M. tells the players, "Here's what happened last week."
MCDM-1439||Suddenly, they're getting a view of what happened the week before from my point of view. And because I sit behind the D.M. Screen, and because of my authority as a Dungeon Master, my description of what happened the week before
MCDM-1440||sounds more authoritative, it sounds more real, than how they remember it. And, even though you may not realize it, there is almost always a difference between how you remember things and how your players remember things.
MCDM-1441||That's something you are going to learn pretty quickly once you start running the game. Every session of D&D is kind of like Rashomon. Each player, including you, remembers things differently.
MCDM-1442||And when you jump in, and you start describing how you remember things suddenly they feel like that's the real way it happened, and when it disagrees with what they think happened, now you've got a problem.
MCDM-1443||So, one of the things I've noticed is that asking my players, "Okay, who wants to sum up what happened last week?" Acts as a terrific diagnostic tool,
MCDM-1444||it helps me understand "what do you guys think happened last week?" And it's useful because often, it turns out, they don't realize what kind of a jam they're in, or, alternatively, they think that this is going to be a horrible fight coming up
MCDM-1445||but in fact it's not, or maybe think this N.P.C.'s angry at them when I didn't think that, or maybe they think they solved a problem when I didn't think they did. And rather than contradict them,
MCDM-1446||it gives me the opportunity to kind of change things behind the scenes to accommodate them. Because, I don't feel comfortable contradicting them and saying "no, no, that's not what happened, let me tell you what happened."
MCDM-1447||I mean, sometimes at critical points, obviously that's necessary. But, generally, I like to err on the side of the players. So I try to keep my mouth shut, and I try to actually encourage my players to tell me what they think happened
MCDM-1448||because then I get their point of view, and that helps me decide what really happened last week. There's a tendency to be like, "No, this is how I remember it, and I'm the D.M., so that's the right way." When in fact, if that brings you into conflict with the players it's best to err on their side.
MCDM-1449||So that's just a little piece of advice about how to start your game. So I do use a D.M. Screen. I have ever since I started. And the 5th edition D.M. Screen, I think is actually pretty poor.
MCDM-1450||At least it's not, let me put it this way, it's not well suited for the way I run the game. You can kind of tell, based on what information Wizards of the Coast put on the D.M. Screen, what they expect you to be doing with the game.
MCDM-1451||For instance, there's a whole panel here, I don't know if you can see it, for N.P.C. generation. Rolling a random N.P.C. including giving him a random name. One quarter of this whole thing is dedicated to making random N.P.C.s
MCDM-1452||and that's not something I really need. It's easy for me to make up names and invent N.P.C.s on the fly; I'm a writer. So maybe you find that useful, maybe you like this D.M. Screen. There was also a cool chart on here which I like a lot, but never use called, "Something Happens."
MCDM-1453||And you roll a d20 whenever your game kind of grinds to a halt and the players are bickering and this helps you get inspiration for what to do next. For instance, you roll an 11 and someone gets angry.
MCDM-1454||And that's all good and well, but I have different needs as a D.M. In fact, one of the things I find baffling is that there is no list of things players do in combat telling me what types of actions they all are.
MCDM-1455||That's something I definitely need, because my players will often ask me, "Can I draw my weapon? Can I drink a potion? Can I use this magic item?" And I have to kind of make a ruling on the fly,
MCDM-1456||which is sort of how D&D 5 is supposed to be run, but there are answers to these things, they're in the Player's Handbook or the D.M.'s Guide, and I can never remember them off the top of my head.
MCDM-1457||That's one of the problems with having run the game for 30 years I remember lots of answers I remember the right answer from several different editions of the game,
MCDM-1458||which are now wrong answers. So it would be nice if that stuff were on here, and it kind of bums me out that it's not. But, the good news is, with only a little bit of work,
MCDM-1459||you can find online variations on this that other people have made. PDFs and Google Docs that you can download and print out and if you buy one of these you can just paperclip your own version to it.
MCDM-1460||I'll put a link in the doobely-do [description box] to a bunch of different versions. You can look at them, and pick the one you like. That is, if you decide to use a D.M. Screen. Like I said, not everybody does. I tend to think of not using a D.M. Screen as something old-school D.M.s do - older school than me.
MCDM-1461||But in point of fact, I read an article with Jordan Weisman, the guy that founded FASA and WizKids, in which he describes going to a game store that Dave Arneson ran, Dave Arneson is one of the guys who invented D&D,
MCDM-1462||and Dave Arneson ran D&D for Jordan and his buddies, and he did it from behind a full-body screen. He was completely obscured while he was running the game,
MCDM-1463||and I think the effect he was going for was the voice of an omniscient narrator coming from nowhere. Except of course, it's coming from behind that screen which is kind of weird to me. And I remember when this article came out, a lot of people said they thought that was weird,
MCDM-1464||and then a lot of people came out of the woodwork who had played back in the early 1970s and said, "No, actually, a lot of people, including Gary Guygax ran the game from behind full-body screens, you wouldn't see them at all." I'm not sure how long that tradition lasted,
MCDM-1465||but the idea was that you were exploring the dungeon, not reading the Dungeon Master and that obscuring his face meant that you couldn't see what his reaction was to the things that you were doing. It also gave him the opportunity to change maps behind the screen, and you wouldn't even know that he was doing it.
MCDM-1466||So, that seems pretty weird to me, but I bet if I had played back then I would have thought it was pretty neat. So, my friend Jim Murphy has been running D&D since around then, around 1976, and he never uses a D.M. Screen.
MCDM-1467||He thinks of them as a kind of crutch, and also he doesn't like that feeling of being separated from the players. And, keep in mind, this is one of the best D.M.s I've ever played with. But, and uh, he's not here to defend himself - I actually interviewed him for this
MCDM-1468||in fact, maybe I will, maybe I'll go and have coffee with Jim and I'll do a little Q&A with him. So, if you have any questions for a guy who ran D&D back in 1976, let me know and I'll ask Jim. So, I think the reason Jim doesn't use a D.M. Screen, is that he feels it's a kind of cheat.
MCDM-1469||He feels like if the players see you rolling behind the screen, then they will think the results aren't real. Whereas, if he rolls the dice in front of you, then you all know that is objectively what would have happened. "I rolled a 20 for the orc, he critically hits you."
MCDM-1470||I didn't just decide the orc critically hits you because  you've had an easy time of it this evening, We all saw the die, it said 20, you were critically hit. And that is undeniably true. When the players see you, the D.M., rolling in front of them
MCDM-1471||they suddenly get apprehensive. That is a real roll, and there's nothing anyone can do about it once it's done. And that's probably the number one job of the D.M. Screen, is to give you, the D.M., the opportunity to roll behind the screen.
MCDM-1472||Jim does not have the opportunity to roll behind the screen, he does not have the opportunity to, as they call it, to fudge the die roles. Why would you want to fudge the die rolls? Why would you want to lie to your players?
MCDM-1473||Well, don't think of it as lying to your players; think of it as curating the experience. In fact, original D&D, back in 1974, the D.M. rolled all the dice. He rolled the dice for your character's stats when you made your character.
MCDM-1474||Right, I want you to think about that. You didn't get to make your own character. The D.M. rolled all your stats, he rolled your hit rolls, he rolled your damage rolls.
MCDM-1475||Now, again, that seems super weird to me, But, when you think about it, that means that D&D back then was a much more curated experience. Let's say you wanted to play a fighter.
MCDM-1476||I would tell you "Oh, yeah, no, I rolled an 18 strength for you, fantastic, but I got a 6 intelligence." Right, I could give you a character with stats that were good in the things they needed to be good in, but I could one or two things that were not that good to give you some interesting roll playing challenges.
MCDM-1477||We don't do it that way anymore, although I think there still is a good reason for the D.M. to make some rolls. For instance, one thing many D.M.s do, and I have done in the past and I probably will do in the future, is they'll make a little cheat sheet behind the screen with each P.C.s name on it
MCDM-1478||and they'll have on there what each character's perception bonus is and their stealth bonus is. So that when the player says "I'll hide in the shadows," they don't roll, you roll. Okay, why would you do that?
MCDM-1479||Because, I think there's an argument to be made that it's unrealistic for a player to know, "Is my character successfully hiding in the shadows?" It doesn't matter what you roll, your character certainly thinks he's hiding in the shadows.
MCDM-1480||As opposed to an athletics check. If you try to jump a chasm, you objectively know if you've failed or not. But, something like hiding, I think, your character doesn't know how well hidden he is, so why should the player? And then you get some interesting drama. The player starts to wonder, "Did I make it? Did I do a good job?"
MCDM-1481||Now, that's not to everybody's taste; I don't do that currently. But, I'm thinking about doing it again; I think my players would like it. And there's a good argument to be made for doing the same thing with perception.
MCDM-1482||when you tell the players, "Okay, make a perception check." You just told them that there was something to notice. And if they all fail, they know that they didn't notice it.
MCDM-1483||And that is another way to break their similitude, I think. Break suspension of disbelief. Suddenly the players go "Ah, what did we miss?"
MCDM-1484||Which is not really what you want them to be thinking. So, again, there's not a right way to do this stuff, these are just suggestions. These are things I know D.Ms do, things I've done as a D.M.
MCDM-1485||And, in fact, I got the idea from my friend, Brad, who was one of my favorite D.M.s, he ran for me when I was a teenager, And, I, as a player, really liked the style of play. So, my friend Jim Murphy doesn't use a D.M. Screen, he always rolls all his rolls in front of the players.
MCDM-1486||And, as a result, there's a lot more tension when he rolls, because you know it's real quote, unquote, but the flip side of that is, and I'm not making this up, almost every campaign Jim has started, began with a total party kill.
MCDM-1487||Or sometimes there was one survivor. Whatever. And that's because often, Jim starts a new campaign when there's a new edition of D&D out, and since it's a new edition of D&D, he doesn't know the rules that well yet.
MCDM-1488||I've actually had conversations with him after the fact where he said, "Wow, you know, I thought that four spectors wasn't going to be that hard for you guys." Because he remembers and edition of D&D where four spectors wasn't that hard for us.
MCDM-1489||And because he doesn't roll behind the D.M. screen he doesn't have an opportunity mid-combit to go, "Wow, this battle is a lot tougher than I thought. I didn't mean for it to be this hard." So that's one of the purposes of the D.M. Screen. It's to help hide your screw-ups.
MCDM-1490||You didn't mean for this combat to be this difficult, but because you are rolling behind the screen you have the opportunity to kind of miss every once in awhile, do less damage than the dice actually said to do.
MCDM-1491||And this is something where the first time you do it, it might be obvious, but after you've gotten the hang of it you'll know how to do it in such a way that your players don't notice. I've gotten to the point now, I've been doing this for a while, where I generally roll in front of the players,
MCDM-1492||to increase that feeling of verisimilitude, but about 20-30 percent of the time, I roll behind the screen. And, most of the time the only reason I'm doing that,
MCDM-1493||is so that when I need to roll behind the screen it doesn't look so suspicious. Right, if you only every roll behind the screen, because you need to fudge a roll, your players will notice. One thing I try to avoid doing is fudging my dice to keep a bad guy alive just because I like them.
MCDM-1494||Trust me, there are better ways to do that. One trick I've used, and this works especially well when the bad guy is an evil priest of a dark god, is if the bad guys isn't being as effective as I thought he would be and the players are going to kill him earlier than I thought,
MCDM-1495||I just let them do their thing, the bad guys dies, and then I have their god kind of show up and say, "No, I have plans for you; rise." And now they fight an undead, more empowered version, of that same bad guy. That may seem kind of video-gamey, but when it's happening to the players in the heat of combat,
MCDM-1496||and it's the villain of the adventure, it will seem epic. So, that's the D.M. Screen episode. Actually, I pulled out all my old D.M. Screens, you can see my old Birthright Screen here,
MCDM-1497||this is from 1994, 1996 I think? It's pretty epic. I apologize, the my mic quality is going to drop a little bit, here. And you can see that back in the day, the D.M. Screen was not, it wasn't landscape, it was portrait.
MCDM-1498||I also have my slightly less-old Third Edition D.M. Screen. I have run every edition of D&D since A D&D I love them all for one reason or another, and in every instance I got burned out on them eventually.
MCDM-1499||Just because, the burden of some rules became, wow...holy crap, look at this. There is, I have...this is a little bit of memorabilia here, for me... This is a little cheat sheet I made.
MCDM-1500||I'll take a picture of it, and put it up there so you can see it. I would do this all the time; you know, I should start doing it again. It's just a list of all the different P.C.s in my game, and then a bunch of columns.
MCDM-1501||And, in one column is their armor class. That saves a lot of time because I roll the dice and I know whether I hit or not. I don't have to say, "What's your armor class again?" I also have on here each character's max hit points, and I would keep track of their current hit points over the course of the battle.
MCDM-1502||Now that does cost more work from your point of view as a D.M., and it may not be worth it for you, but I liked knowing what the players' current and total hit points were for a couple reasons. For one thing, as the P.C.s level up, the difference in their hit points starts to become significant,
MCDM-1503||and doing 20 points of damage to one character might bring them from full hit points to almost dead, whereas that same 20 points to another character might only take them to half damage. And it's useful to know, "Which character am I about to kill with this attack?"
MCDM-1504||Also, keeping track of the running total means you know when you are about to kill a character, and I find that is useful information. Now, the goal here isn't to kill or not kill characters.
MCDM-1505||The goal here is just to provide a plausible dramatic experience. And sometimes you may discover that your own ignorance, or the players' ignorance, or the dice, undermine that. I've had evenings where I couldn't roll less than a 17, and I realized, "If I keep doing this, the players are all going to die!"
MCDM-1506||This wasn't a tough encounter until I couldn't miss. The opposite also happens. Sometimes I can't roll higher than a three and I think, "this is ridiculous, this is a cake walk." and the players feel let down. They were expecting something dramatic, and in fact, it turns out to be not that memorable.
MCDM-1507||Now, not every fight needs to be memorable. You should only be challenging the players at certain moments in the adventure. I'll have another episode talking about pacing.
MCDM-1508||It's one of those things that, once you've done it a couple times, you start to get the hang of it, but when you know each character's current hit points, that gives you the opportunity to have the bad guys discreetly switch targets from one to the other, so you don't end up accidentally killing a character when you didn't mean to.
MCDM-1509||Lastly, I wrote down each character's saving throws, and I put a box around which one had the worst saving throw in each category, and that helped me making decisions running the bad guys. In a certain sense it's cheating, because obviously the bad guys don't know what the different character's saving throws are,
MCDM-1510||but in another sense, the bad guys, I think, are roughly as intelligent as the good guys, usually, and you can tell which of these characters is the priest, just like the good guys can tell which of the bad guys is the shaman, and typically the priest has a high wisdom save, so don't cast spells on that character that require wisdom save.
MCDM-1511||Just like you can tell the thief is the nimble, dexterous one; don't attack them with something that requires a reflex save. I think it's reasonable to assume you can tell by looking at a character which one's the smart one, which one's the nimble one, which one's the heavily armored one, and make decisions accordingly.
MCDM-1512||But if you don't have these numbers, then actually it can kind of get confusing. It's also useful, because as the players accrue abilities and magic items, it may seem harder and harder to challenge them.
MCDM-1513||Remember, they out number you, you know, 5 or 6 to 1. So, having a little cheat sheet like this with their hit points and armor class and their saving throws which gives you some idea of what the party's weaknesses are, can make combat a little more interesting.
MCDM-1514||I guarantee you that some people are going to say that this is cheating, and that's fine, don't do it if you don't think it's a good idea. I don't do this anymore; I haven't done this in a long time. Although, I'm thinking that maybe I should do it again. So that's the D.M. Screen episode. Like I said, you'll find links in the doobley doo [description box] to lots of other,
MCDM-1515||alternative D.M. Screens that other players, like you, have made, that you can print out, and if you go and buy a D.M. Screen, you know, from your game store you can then just paperclip the printouts to the inside, and that allows you to customize your D.M. Screen
MCDM-1516||and put whatever you want in there. Thanks for watching. I hope you liked that episode. If you want to help support the channel, there's a link to my amazon page in the doobley doo [description box].
MCDM-1517||I'm an independent fantasy author in my spare time; I write fantasy novels. If you like D&D, or you just like fantasy, you might like them. Read the reviews, read the descriptions, see what you think, check it out. I'd also like to give a shot out to my friend Jay, Jason Hill, who is one of the people who inspired me to start this channel.
MCDM-1518||Jay has his own channel where he will help teach you how to be 3-d modeler and a character designer. That's what he does for Turtle Rock Studios. Jay's an incredibly talented guy. He's one of my best friends. I feel lucky to know him.
MCDM-1519||Jay, I love you. Jay has a great video where he sculpts Judge Dredd in Zebra. I'll put a link to that in the doobley doo [description box]. Go to his channel, watch his video, let him know what characters from movies you'd like to see him sculpt, that'll motivate him to make more videos.
MCDM-1520||He and I are having kind of a friendly rivalry where we are trying to see which one of us can get to 5,000 subscribers first. He has a huge head start on me, but I'm catching up. So, go check out his videos, and subscribe, but not until I hit 5,000 first.
MCDM-1521||Next week we are going to talk about, what is in the box, [box clanks as shaken] and why it might destroy your campaign, unless you are clever, and take my advice and use it in an interesting way. Till next time. Peace. Out.
MCDM-1522||I know how it seems running D DS is crazy juggling act keeping all these balls in the air you feel like you're
MCDM-1523||riding a catastrophy weight that could collapse at any minute well the good news is when you fail it's question a
MCDM-1524||win not if your friends will remember they'll be impressed you could do it at all
MCDM-1525||Kent at the end of the day the price of failure is no big deal Oh shucks I would've brought him out if
MCDM-1526||I didn't know how to use them shucks I wouldn't put it on less I'm good at it on today's episode we're
MCDM-1527||gonna talk about failure Cass trophic failure like happened to me a couple of weeks ago in my D&D game so those of you
MCDM-1528||who have been following my videos and who remember the episode about the black pudding you may remember me talking
MCDM-1529||about how that one encounter with this news changed my campaign in fact it did a lot more than that it resulted in me
MCDM-1530||killing my boss and I phrased it that way because that's the most dramatic way I can think of doing it but that's not
MCDM-1531||how I felt I felt like I had killed my friends character and that was awful I hated it I hated everything that
MCDM-1532||happened that night it was a terrible evening but we survived it and we're gonna talk about
MCDM-1533||how in order to really understand what happened there's gonna be a lot of stuff in the doobly-doo for you to download
MCDM-1534||and read at your leisure it's all optional you should be able to understand the story without it for the
MCDM-1535||second Turtle Rock Studios D&D group I sent an email out to the players and the title of the email was the baron of beta
MCDM-1536||guard is dead his family murdered now the political situation in the barony in which the game started I considered
MCDM-1537||somewhat optional if the players were interested in engaging with it that's cool if they weren't that's cool too I
MCDM-1538||had an adventure ready that would have hooks into that politics but didn't require the players being interested in
MCDM-1539||it they could just be interested in dungeon delving and they still have a lot of fun I thought now that email is
MCDM-1540||in the doobly-doo there's also a description of my campaign setting which is a one-page description because I
MCDM-1541||think that way people are more likely to read it and there's a map and all the stuff you would expect and in this
MCDM-1542||description it talks about how humans don't trust elves and dwarves for various reasons there is the bad guy
MCDM-1543||who's like 17th level so it's not something you worry about at low levels the invincible overlord
MCDM-1544||and he has taken over the entire area and in order for the dwarves to continue to govern themselves how they want they
MCDM-1545||have to give the invincible overlords slaves so now the dwarves are famous as slow
MCDM-1546||now how do you as a door feel about that that's up to you one of the players as a dwarf player and he read that stuff and
MCDM-1547||he was aware of it but I think he thought of it as kind of not applying to him that's Matt's weird campaign stuff
MCDM-1548||what do I care I'm a cool dwarf war cleric again that didn't bother me I didn't think the players had any
MCDM-1549||obligation to engage with this stuff I think a lot of players like playing non-human characters because they play a
MCDM-1550||human in real life but I like running games that have a political element to them and so I tend to run a humano
MCDM-1551||centric campaign one of the players in fact said I'm gonna play a human druid because everyone you're setting is a
MCDM-1552||xenophobe that's not literally true there's nothing racial about the wait humans treat dwarves it's purely because
MCDM-1553||the dwarves made this bargain this Faustian deal with the invincible overlord I thought that'd be a cool hook
MCDM-1554||for a dwarf player to be disgusted with that and be here with the humans because he's trying to do something about it
MCDM-1555||this is all important to the story stay tuned so there's the original email I sent out describing the central tension
MCDM-1556||of the campaign and we'll do a video on central tensions later I think they're critically important to a good campaign
MCDM-1557||and then I sent out the campaign one-page summary which talked about how many of these species don't trust each
MCDM-1558||other because of the pressure of the invincible overlord and then the players found this super important artifact
MCDM-1559||called the shield of and rim the shield of and room is one of a set there's a shield as a sword as a crown and they
MCDM-1560||confer nobility and room is the name of the entire map that I present the players and there hasn't been a king of
MCDM-1561||and room for a long time somebody with the shield of Andrea could declare themselves the king of and Rim and
MCDM-1562||especially if they were a hero who would save the town or maybe even the entire barony people would follow them and when
MCDM-1563||our players took the shield to their friendly neighborhood high level wizard NPC he expressly told them whatever you
MCDM-1564||do with that do not take it to the city of Boettiger keep because stuff that's happening there is bad news I don't
MCDM-1565||trust the regent it's best that you guys keep it you're going to go into the swamp anyway and go fight some goblins
MCDM-1566||so armed with this information the players made a decision they needed new armor they needed better weapons and the
MCDM-1567||only place they could get heavy armor and heavy weapons was Boettiger key so they strode into Boettiger keep all
MCDM-1568||unawares up until this point there was no need for them to pay attention to the politics of the city but from one point
MCDM-1569||of view that ignorance cost them in fact it cost one player his character when the players entered Boettiger cape i
MCDM-1570||showed them the map which you can see here and i described place is the word to visit they go to
MCDM-1571||the blacksmith they go to the tavern there's a church in town and that's unusual because up until now I described
MCDM-1572||every town in the area as having a ruined church in fact the players had visited a ruin to church and I described
MCDM-1573||that the invincible overlord does not like organized religion in fact it isn't like much organization that isn't his
MCDM-1574||own and in each instance I thought there was a reason the players would visit each of these one of the players needed
MCDM-1575||new arms and armor so he'd go to the blacksmith I expected the thief to want to go to the in the tavern and do some
MCDM-1576||investigation and find out hey what's going on in this town I expected maybe one of the players to go to the church
MCDM-1577||and check it out why is there a church here but the players didn't do at almost any of that they wanted to go visit the
MCDM-1578||wizard and get their stuff identified they had magic items I want to get identified and there were friends with
MCDM-1579||this wizard but they also had a note which you can see here which you can download describing the bad guys plan to
MCDM-1580||kidnap this wizard so they arrived in town and they all decide to go see the wizard with one exception
MCDM-1581||the dwarf says I don't care about visiting the wizard I want to go to the blacksmith and get a new suit of armor
MCDM-1582||and a new weapon because the black pudding corroded his so the dwarf war priest goes to the blacksmith everyone
MCDM-1583||else goes to visit the wizard they knock on the door and a knight opens the door now the last time the players had
MCDM-1584||visited this wizard it was in his mobile tower his Darrin's instant fortress which was something they found in the
MCDM-1585||road while they were trying to track him down and just like then when they arrived at his mobile tower there was a
MCDM-1586||knight there and when they knocked on the door this Knight opened the door but that night was an ally of the wizard and
MCDM-1587||the players got to know her lady Avelina these Knights were unknown to the players now there were two knights in
MCDM-1588||the tower at this point Knights of the Black Rose and unbeknownst to the players these are high-level bad guy
MCDM-1589||Knights most of them are fighters a couple of them are evil paladin's specifically I think of them as ill
MCDM-1590||riggers from this great issue of Dragon Magazine stay with me this story has an ending the two Knights look at each
MCDM-1591||other and say who are you guys and the hero say we are friends of the wizard taste and they say really will the
MCDM-1592||wizard is missing and the players say well we just saw him not even a week ago and the two Knights look at each other
MCDM-1593||and they whisper they talk to each other and they say you may be the last people to see the wizard alive would you be
MCDM-1594||willing to come talk to the regent and tell him what happened now this is a critical moment because
MCDM-1595||from this point forward the players options begin to narrow and they sense this but didn't know what they could do
MCDM-1596||about it one of the players said wait are these Knights the same Knights that we met last time and I said no these
MCDM-1597||Knights have black roses on their Harold so that was an ill omen now these Knights had a plan let's get these rat
MCDM-1598||catchers these mercenaries into the keep away from prying eyes where we can accuse them of whatever we want and then
MCDM-1599||hang them and in the morning the townspeople will wake up and see these dead adventurers and we'll tell them
MCDM-1600||these are the people that kidnapped and killed our wizard thereby relieving themselves of any guilt
MCDM-1601||so these Knights are acting suspiciously but I didn't want them to act too suspiciously because then it would be
MCDM-1602||obvious and they are trying to trick the players the players agreed their leader is the wizard skoros their pc wizard who
MCDM-1603||is a very lawful good character and basically goes along with whatever the law says and whatever the right thing to
MCDM-1604||do is so when these Knights say will you come with us and talk to the region he's like sure and everyone goes with him so
MCDM-1605||as they go from the Wizards tower to the keep they pick up another Knight now there are three Knights guarding them as
MCDM-1606||you can see their window has narrowed now they can take on two knights probably three Knights that's still
MCDM-1607||doable but then they enter the keep without any objection and they end up outside the region's receiving room in
MCDM-1608||this a little for yay and now there are four knights and the players are now very suspicious one of them says can I
MCDM-1609||make a roll to see if I suspect anything and that kind of baffled me because I felt like you suspect them you obviously
MCDM-1610||have a suspicion otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that act on that suspicion but I realized that what the player
MCDM-1611||really wanted was some kind of objective omniscient narrator confirmation of that suspicion so I said yeah go right ahead
MCDM-1612||and roll make an intuition check he rolled really high and so I texted the player you are being set up now at that
MCDM-1613||point I really think the only thing the players could do would be attack these four Knights because from this point
MCDM-1614||forward things are only going to get worse their options are only going to narrow but the player tried to go to the
MCDM-1615||bathroom do you mind if I excused myself go to the Privy and the four Knights of course don't want these people going
MCDM-1616||anywhere they're trying to trap them and say no no one visits the Privy while you're waiting to talk to the Regent and
MCDM-1617||at that point the players were ushered in to see the region too now there are six nights there is the evil priest and
MCDM-1618||the Regent the regent of Boettiger Lord sexton I tried to pick a name that was ominous
MCDM-1619||the players are now in this long hallway with big stained-glass windows this is where the Baron of betta gar used to
MCDM-1620||receive people and his throne remains empty nearby is a much smaller throne that the Regent uses and he asked the
MCDM-1621||players to describe what happened when they saw taste and they start telling him but he is not really interested this
MCDM-1622||was all a ruse the players away from the public getting them away from the townspeople into this
MCDM-1623||yo room where it's just him and his knights and they can do whatever they want so he starts saying some ominous
MCDM-1624||things to the players the PC Wizards Kouros says hang on the minute wait a minute we didn't have anything to do
MCDM-1625||with the disappearance of taste we have this note from the bad guys saying how they're gonna kidnap the wizard the
MCDM-1626||region says may I see that note and the wizard Skaro says absolutely here you go the region takes it looks at it and rips
MCDM-1627||a tie he says arrest those men because I want to remove any ambiguity at this point
MCDM-1628||and the players were wondering why they're being arrested I had the Regent turned to his priest and say we can pin
MCDM-1629||the disappearance on the wizard on these rat catchers no one will guess that we had anything to do with it now that was
MCDM-1630||the end of that session I said we'll pick it up next week and it'll be initiative the players spent the next
MCDM-1631||week talking about what they could do the thief's player asked me is it reasonable for me to have my thieves
MCDM-1632||tools like hidden about my person so that if I'm captured and searched they won't find them I said do it as far as
MCDM-1633||I'm concerned you always have your thieves tools hidden about your person you're a thief I mean unless you're in
MCDM-1634||the dungeon in which case it makes sense to have them handy otherwise when you're in town why would you have them anywhere
MCDM-1635||else I wanted that player to understand that if he got captured he would probably be able to get out of a jail
MCDM-1636||cell using as these tools meanwhile the wizard player said guys I don't know about you but I'll be able to get out of
MCDM-1637||here I have invisibility memorized also the druid player said I don't about you guys but I can turn into a spider and I
MCDM-1638||can get out of here if we end up in jail I can just slip through the bars so I felt as though we had a pretty good
MCDM-1639||session lined up for the next week the players were gonna get arrested they were going to end up in jail and they
MCDM-1640||were gonna try to find a way out and they would discover what had happened to the dwarf player who wasn't with them
MCDM-1641||remember the dwarf war priest was talking to the blacksmith and something extraordinary happened I would switch
MCDM-1642||between the players in the kief and the dwarf at the blacksmith and go back and forth to try to keep everybody engaged
MCDM-1643||and so the dwarf Wahoos that the blacksmith walks up to this huge cumin so very large blacksmith there are lots
MCDM-1644||of people in here doing work and lots of customers the dwarf says excuse me master Smith I need some new armor and a
MCDM-1645||new weapon and the Smith spits on the ground and says I do not deal with slavers now this was the first time the
MCDM-1646||dwarf player ever had to deal with that prejudice and I was sort of curious as to what he would do because this was a
MCDM-1647||player who hadn't done a lot of role-playing up until now I was kind of amazed the dwarf player went for it he
MCDM-1648||role played he spoke in character he was a dwarf he wasn't gonna let this guy talk to like this and he wasn't a slaver
MCDM-1649||and he told the Smith I'm not flavor in fact I saved the people of gravis further nearby town near to betta
MCDM-1650||gar keep there was being attacked by Undead and my friends and I saved that whole place
MCDM-1651||he gave an impassioned in character speech I was impressed but I thought it would probably take a little bit more
MCDM-1652||than you know one mouthy dwarf to change this blacksmith's mind so I said alright I'll give you a 20% chance that someone
MCDM-1653||from the nearby town of gravis bur that you had saved is here in betta gar keep I mean this is the local big city so of
MCDM-1654||course there's people moving back and forth all the time so the dwarf player rolled percentile dice enrolled a 19 so
MCDM-1655||I had a customer in the Smith who say he's right he's telling the truth I was there I remember him they're heroes they
MCDM-1656||saved us the blacksmith was like wow I I guess I was wrong at this point the dwarf pushed his luck I think because he
MCDM-1657||was trying to get better prices for his gear and he said you're right I'm a hero in fact I'm a friend of taste the Beres
MCDM-1658||wizard tastes yours towns wizard you should be nice to me at that point he feels fingers pinching his elbow and a
MCDM-1659||figure a small figure at a siding he turns and he looks and there's a halfling there and the halfling says uh
MCDM-1660||excuse me friend your voice carries shouldn't we be talking about this outside and the dwarf player realizes
MCDM-1661||that something strange is going on he goes on uh yeah let's talk outside he asks the Smith to hang on a minute and
MCDM-1662||he and the halfling go outside so this point I take of the dwarf player outside and we roleplay his conversation with a
MCDM-1663||halfling out of your shot of the rest of the group so they and for the next week have no idea what happened between the
MCDM-1664||door for the halfling the halfling says what's wrong with you don't you know what's going on don't you know that
MCDM-1665||taste is missing because he was loyal to the Baron the Baron and his family were murdered and everyone thinks the regent
MCDM-1666||did it and the dwarf says whoa no I had no idea the halfling says where are your friends where's the rest of the party
MCDM-1667||that saved the people of greatest verse and the dwarf says well they're all talking to the wizard and a thing says
MCDM-1668||oh my god the Black Rose are going to arrest them take them to the region and they're going to be accused of the
MCDM-1669||Wizards murder the halfling says what would you be willing to do to save your friends and the dwarf said I would be
MCDM-1670||willing to do anything I would risk my life to save my friends of course he would he's a dwarf the halfling says
MCDM-1671||yeah okay having you guys owe us a favor isn't bad and if you guys can find taste and save him
MCDM-1672||then taste would owe us a favor and that's not bad either all right I'll help you out the halfling says and
MCDM-1673||reaches behind his neck and pulls out like a leather thong this key he snaps the key off and he says this is a
MCDM-1674||skeleton key to the Barons prisons now the Regent may have changed the locks but if he hasn't this will get you in or
MCDM-1675||out of any door in the jail he says how can we hide this about your person so that they won't
MCDM-1676||find you if you happen to get arrested they'll search you I know come here he says now the player who plays this dwarf
MCDM-1677||has this great beard so I walk up and make like I'm trying to fiddle with his beard and I say the halfling starts
MCDM-1678||braiding the key into your beard he says they'll never look forward here the dwarf player thinks this is awesome
MCDM-1679||he's like oh this is going to be amazing yeah my beard smart then the halfling draws a picture of the keep in the sand
MCDM-1680||and says this is the keep and this is the Wizards tower nearby and this is the secret corridor that connects the two
MCDM-1681||underground in the same level as the jails so if you can get your friends out you don't have to try to escape through
MCDM-1682||the keep you can escape through the secret corridor and up and out through the Wizards tower the dwarf is now
MCDM-1683||incredibly stoked because he is certain he knows what's gonna happen they're gonna get arrested they're gonna be in
MCDM-1684||jail and he's gonna help bust him out and that's kind of what I thought was gonna happen but that's not what
MCDM-1685||happened so here is this week's lesson never take away your players agency I mean I'm sure there can be people in the
MCDM-1686||comments that say oh I've done it before and it worked great well fine I'm sure there are exceptions but I have now done
MCDM-1687||this three or four times since I was 15 and every single time it is failed any time you set your players up in a
MCDM-1688||situation where they have to surrender they will not you can begin an adventure with the players captured in jail in
MCDM-1689||fact that's how out of the abyss begins and I think it's fantastic but you can't put the players in that scenario they
MCDM-1690||will never go for it they will always try to fight their way out in fact they will fight their way out on purpose even
MCDM-1691||if they know they will fail just to be stubborn just to show you how much they hate it and you know what I've done the
MCDM-1692||same thing as a player even as a player this is why I should have known and whatever happens from here on out it is
MCDM-1693||not the players fault it's my fault I set them up for this I should not have I should have known better I've had the
MCDM-1694||same thing happened to me as a player and I hated it and I rebelled at it the same way they did nobody throws me my
MCDM-1695||own guns and says ride nobody nobody throat me my own gun it says run nobody so the next week when it was
MCDM-1696||initiative the dwarf player is sitting there waiting for them to get captured he's super excited to see what's going
MCDM-1697||to happen but the players have concocted their own plan now since the week before they have sort of realized the scenario
MCDM-1698||they're in they realize they have brought the shield of and room to the Regent they have brought him the thing
MCDM-1699||he needs to legitimize his rule the one thing their NPC buddy tasteless who told him not to do so now they're going to do
MCDM-1700||anything to stop him from getting that shield including risk of their own lives including suicide if it comes down to it
MCDM-1701||and you know what that's super dramatic and in a sense it worked there was an epic battle in which the wizard gave his
MCDM-1702||pack to the half-orc fighter the half war fighter has the shield and now the half war fighter has the shield and the
MCDM-1703||Wizards spell book the wizard was very afraid of his spell book getting captured by the bad guys the wizard then
MCDM-1704||casts invisibility on the half work he had originally planned on casting on himself kind of selfishly so that he
MCDM-1705||knew he would escape but now he's doing it selflessly he's saying you go invisible take the shield take all our
MCDM-1706||gear get out of here and this amazing chess game played out where the bad guys attacked the player-character wizard to
MCDM-1707||disrupt his concentration that caused the half-orc to go from being invisible to visible then the bad guy priest casts
MCDM-1708||whole person on the orc and freezes the orc then the good guys attack the evil priest and disrupt his concentration
MCDM-1709||causing the orc to be able to move again back and forth it goes players go down players go back up these Knights turn
MCDM-1710||out to be incredibly tough but so are the players three of them escape two of them are captured the wizard is attacked
MCDM-1711||by one of the paladins and goes down in one shot because I had sort of forgotten or maybe I didn't even really know that
MCDM-1712||the third-level wizard at max hip points has ten hit points so in fact I did enough damage to him
MCDM-1713||to kill him outright and I said no no they're not trying to kill you they're attacking to subdue remember they want
MCDM-1714||you guys to hang in the morning they want to kill you here where no one's watching now from one point of view that
MCDM-1715||was an epic battle but from another point of view it was miserable because the players were constantly describing
MCDM-1716||how they felt like they had no choice they felt like there was nothing they could do they felt like they had been
MCDM-1717||railroaded and that made me feel bad so I wasn't having a good time so even though if this had been any other
MCDM-1718||scenario I think everyone would have thought wow that was an epic battle it didn't feel that way it felt like this
MCDM-1719||intense struggle for or control over player agency the three players escape they steal some horses
MCDM-1720||they ride to the blacksmith they find the door for they say we got to get out of here the dwarf says wait a minute
MCDM-1721||wait a man I need to tell you what happened and the players say no no no time to explain
MCDM-1722||get on the horse the dwarf says ok and gets on the horse and they ride out of town so for the players are out of town
MCDM-1723||two of the players are captured the two captured players wake up in the jail they're not sure how much time has gone
MCDM-1724||by I think that's maybe an important point as far as they knew they could be about to be hung you'll be caught and
MCDM-1725||damn well hung I think he looks pretty well madam please we have no time the guard is one of the Knights it's not a
MCDM-1726||typical man-at-arms this is a powerful night one of the nights that almost killed them a minute ago the two players
MCDM-1727||who were captured the wizard in the druid asked me to describe the jail cell really requests they say can I see the
MCDM-1728||other player are the walls barred or are they stone walls I said well let me draw it out for you that was a mistake
MCDM-1729||me drawing it on the battle map sent the signal that this was a combat encounter and the implication with a combat
MCDM-1730||encounter is that there is a way to win but I didn't mean either of those things I didn't intend this to be a combat
MCDM-1731||encounter at all and I certainly didn't think there was a way for them to get out of this they were both manacled so
MCDM-1732||they couldn't cast spells but I didn't know what kind of signal I was sending so I drew the jail on the mat and I put
MCDM-1733||the Paladin guard where she was and I put the PCs where they were in opposite jail cells and they shared a language
MCDM-1734||they could talk to each other which I didn't know which meant when they were in the for yay and the Druids suspected
MCDM-1735||that these guys were trying to set them up he could have said something in a language that the paladins and the
MCDM-1736||guards couldn't understand and maybe come up with a scenario where they could jump the guards when there were only
MCDM-1737||four of them so these two players captured start talking about how they might be able to get out and the wizard
MCDM-1738||player incredibly bravely said I am going to say the worst most hateful most disgusting things I can to this female
MCDM-1739||guard to get her to come over here and face me now the actual player my friend Phil is not that bad a guy so he doesn't
MCDM-1740||know what to say that would cause her to do that but just telling me my character says those things was enough and it
MCDM-1741||worked they may be in a dire role I don't remember and the guard walks up opens the door to his Jail walks into
MCDM-1742||his cell and says you're to hang in the morning no one said you needed a tongue to do that the implication here was
MCDM-1743||clear she's going to cut out his tongue if he keep talking at this point because of the way
MCDM-1744||the jail cells were situated she has her back to the druid player and unbeknownst to me wild shape is not a spell you
MCDM-1745||don't need your hands-free to be able to do it so the druid player turns into a spider behind the guards back and
MCDM-1746||escapes and now at this point everyone has escaped except the wizard player the Paladin on guard lady Morgan seeing that
MCDM-1747||the druid has escaped behind her back draws her sword and executes skoros the wizard and at that point all hell broke
MCDM-1748||loose the wizard player had no problem with the reality of that it was clear to him that he was at her mercy and she
MCDM-1749||could do this anytime she wanted he was just trying to distract her so the druid could escape but what he didn't know or
MCDM-1750||what he hadn't considered was that this humiliated her and that made her incredibly angry and she is not a
MCDM-1751||regular man-at-arms she is an evil bad guy paladin that we are setting up to be the recurring villains of this adventure
MCDM-1752||first of all she had no idea that either of the PCs could escape and now one of them under her charge is gone and as far
MCDM-1753||as she was concerned the other player character could do the same thing and there was no way she was going to her
MCDM-1754||boss the region is saying I let them both go angry at being humiliated and wanting to make sure that she was at
MCDM-1755||least able to tell her boss one of them didn't get away she executes the wizard now it's reasonable for somebody
MCDM-1756||watching this listen to this to think I did that to teach somebody a lesson but nothing could be further from the truth
MCDM-1757||in fact he was maybe the only player I would have gone that far with because of all the players at the table my friend
MCDM-1758||Phil playing the wizard was the one who was the most skeptical of me letting the players off the hook he's the one who
MCDM-1759||would say Matt's taking it easy on us in fact at one point he said you took it easy on us last night and I'm like what
MCDM-1760||are you talking about and he goes no I know what you did you stopped kind of paying attention to how we were managing
MCDM-1761||light because you knew that otherwise we were gonna get smoked by these goblins in the mine and I was like Phil I don't
MCDM-1762||really know how the rules for light work I didn't do anything to take it easy on you I just forgot but that's how he
MCDM-1763||thinks and I guess maybe I'm projecting too because that's how I think as a player I'm always kind of because I'm a
MCDM-1764||GM I'm always kind of aware of when the dungeon master is making allowances behind the screen to keep the players
MCDM-1765||alive when it otherwise wouldn't be realistic so I thought of all the players there he was the one who
MCDM-1766||wouldn't let me get away with it I felt like I had to do the most realistic plausible thing and in that
MCDM-1767||moment to me there was no way a humiliated evil night was going to let this guy live when lady Morgana realized
MCDM-1768||all the awful things the wizard had said or just a trick and not only had she been tricked but the result of the trick
MCDM-1769||was that the druid player de scaped she was humiliated and in her anger she was capable of anything
MCDM-1770||now when the druid player heard this he said you know what I go back in there and commit suicide against the night I
MCDM-1771||don't want to play anymore this is how unhappy everybody was a large percentage of the players thought this is it we're
MCDM-1772||not playing gened anymore everything has collapsed Phil got up and left now we were playing at work so Phil is
MCDM-1773||now walking around the office at nine o'clock at night and the other people who are there late working or like hey
MCDM-1774||Phil what's going on how's D&D and he is furious my friend Wes said well Matt runs a
MCDM-1775||pretty fair game I guess if you died then there was a good reason and feels like no there was not a good reason part
MCDM-1776||of this is the fact that all through this the players had kind of been bouncing around from one encounter to
MCDM-1777||the next without a whole lot of rhyme or reason and of all the players phil was the most upset by this he was often
MCDM-1778||asking why are we doing this he was the player who was the most upset that they didn't think enough and he's the one
MCDM-1779||that paid the price for everything so it was maximally unjust Phil walked around and talked to some of the other
MCDM-1780||employees blew off some steam and came back sat down and said okay I just need to talk about what happened and that's
MCDM-1781||another lesson when a catastrophe like this occurs it's important that everybody just talk it out describe your
MCDM-1782||perspective to the players why did everything happen you know normally I do not tell the players what their choices
MCDM-1783||are I do not tell the players what they could do in town I do not tell the players what they could do in battle
MCDM-1784||because I sort of feel like that's taking some of the fun away from the players it's disrespectful part of the
MCDM-1785||fun of D&D is you as a player coming up with this stuff but a lot of these players have never played before they
MCDM-1786||literally don't know what the traditions are that I take for granted so we spent the next two hours talking about what it
MCDM-1787||just happened the druid player explained that the reason he committed suicide against the paladin was because he
MCDM-1788||didn't want to play anymore if Phil wasn't gonna play but Phil's reaction was what are you talking about
MCDM-1789||NACA where as far as Phil was concerned we were gonna keep playing he was just really angry now
MCDM-1790||and wanted to talk about what happened I explained the palette of this point of view which I normally don't do but this
MCDM-1791||situation demanded it and Phil thought about it and said okay yeah all right that makes sense I buy it and the party
MCDM-1792||kind of talked the druid player down admittedly he had been complaining about having migraines
MCDM-1793||all night so that's another lesson don't play angry don't play with migraines you know there are a lot of
MCDM-1794||things you know we'd all been at work for eight hours up until then and so there are a lot of things that
MCDM-1795||contribute to players making bad decisions there are a lot of things that contribute to DMS making bad decisions
MCDM-1796||after about half an hour Phil start to think about his new character I said you want a role stance and he said yes now
MCDM-1797||if you've watched my videos before you know I have my own system for generating stats a role for d68 is three but you do
MCDM-1798||them in order so your first role is your strength your second role is your decks and that way players don't bring their
MCDM-1799||own baggage to the table and you get this cool or ocular process of discovering your character but the flip
MCDM-1800||side of that rule is if that character doesn't live you get to roll the normal way which is rule 46 take the highest
MCDM-1801||three and place them wherever you want so you can play whatever character you want immediately Phil started to roll up
MCDM-1802||a new warlock and he was really excited by this warlock and I quoted my friend Mark who once said to me you know Matt
MCDM-1803||when you kill one of my characters I am really legitimately angry at you for about half an hour I am furious at you
MCDM-1804||and he said let me be furious do not try to change what happened to bring my character back from the dead just
MCDM-1805||because I'm unhappy because that's also not satisfying that's not what would have happened just let me be angry for
MCDM-1806||about half an hour and then I'll relax and I'll start thinking about my new character and when I told the party this
MCDM-1807||Phil smiled and nodded and said it's literally been half an hour and now I'm back to wanting to play this new
MCDM-1808||character the other players had never really thought about what would happen when someone died for many of them a
MCDM-1809||player dying meant that was it that was the end of D&D and we had to explain especially Phil and I would play D&D a
MCDM-1810||lot before that look no player dying is not the end of the game when the Drude player realized this he said okay well
MCDM-1811||then in that case I would not have gone in the commit suicide and at this point it started to feel like okay we're all
MCDM-1812||gonna get to keep playing together now the door player finally says guys can I tell you what happened with me and the
MCDM-1813||halfling and he describes this whole scenario they had in their pocket the entire time the opportunity for the
MCDM-1814||dwarf to bust them out of jail but the party never really got arrested only two of the players did and then one of them
MCDM-1815||escaped and the other one was killed so the dwarf never got to do his cool stuff now we've played several times
MCDM-1816||since then we're gonna play again Monday and everything seems to be back to normal and the players are a more
MCDM-1817||cohesive group now than they were before in fact I think every time we play the group is a little bit more tight-knit
MCDM-1818||and my friend Phil who lost his wizard is now playing a warlock and he spent more time on that characters backstory
MCDM-1819||then all the other players put together he made it a point to make his character from the bearing of betta gar so he
MCDM-1820||knows all this stuff he knows who all the bad guys are he knows what happened to the Baron
MCDM-1821||he knows what anyone from this area would know all the stuff that the players have up until now kind of been
MCDM-1822||ignoring so even though he lost a character he is super engaged with what's going on also he has a lot more
MCDM-1823||hit points now so it's a lot more likely to live so what are the lessons to be taken away from this one my overwhelming
MCDM-1824||piece of advice to you is never put the players in a situation where you're taking their agency their ability to
MCDM-1825||decide their own fate away from them in other words never put a gun to their head and say surrender because they
MCDM-1826||won't they will come up with a perfectly plausible reasonable way to escape and try to thwart whatever plan you have
MCDM-1827||like I said I'm sure there's someone who's gonna say no no we've done it before it works fine but in my
MCDM-1828||experience that's never happened even as a player whenever I'm a DM anytime the players are in a scenario where the DM
MCDM-1829||thought they should or would surrender they'd never do that when Phil's character scores died Phil was very
MCDM-1830||mature about the whole thing he got incredibly angry right but he got up and he left he walked it off and then he
MCDM-1831||came back and said let's talk about what happened I need to understand and I explained my point of view and now of
MCDM-1832||course thanks to the dwarf the players have made contact with the local Thieves Guild that have some interest in maybe
MCDM-1833||getting some new allies I wrote up a cool little narrative thing you can download the doobly-doo that I then
MCDM-1834||emailed to the players to show them they're not alone I also wrote a long email to the players I basically
MCDM-1835||recapitulated the video the railroad versus a sandbox and I explained to them something I never had I had given them
MCDM-1836||all this setting material but I had never told them what kind of game do I run what am I like as a DM right now if
MCDM-1837||you're just starting out you might not know what you're like as a DM but I do I know exactly what kind of game I run I
MCDM-1838||know what kind of players I value I know what kind of scenarios I concoct and I didn't communicate any of this to the
MCDM-1839||players why not because I'm an idiot you're an imbecile because I am perfectly capable of
MCDM-1840||screwing up just like anybody else so when I finally wrote this email saying look guys I put these things in front of
MCDM-1841||you the politics of the area the various adventures I have ready and you can pick any of them up or ignore them I don't
MCDM-1842||mind but I also run the kind of game where you can get your cells in over your head you can get yourselves in
MCDM-1843||trouble I don't expect that just because I set up a combat encounter that there is a way
MCDM-1844||for you guys to solve it it's entirely possible you guys could get yourself into a situation because of the choices
MCDM-1845||you made that is suicidal in which case I would expect you to retreat or surrender and the players had never
MCDM-1846||thought about that they didn't know that because I had never told them so if you have some idea of what kind of DM you're
MCDM-1847||going to be tell your players ahead of time say this is the kind of game I run don't just say this is the campaign
MCDM-1848||setting don't just say well hear how my elves are different than D&D elves talk about who you are as a Dungeon Master
MCDM-1849||what kind of game you like running what kind of players do you value or maybe a better way of putting it is what kind of
MCDM-1850||behavior do you value in your players right I like players who are motivated who have their own ambition who want to
MCDM-1851||achieve things in the world so for instance the players have found through their own decision-making I did not put
MCDM-1852||this in front of them they found and took the shield of and room for themselves which means now if they
MCDM-1853||wanted to one of the players could declare himself king of and room and if that player has saved a lot of people
MCDM-1854||people would flock to him but again that's up to the players so I took the time to write an email to explain to
MCDM-1855||them this is the kind of game I run which I should have done months ago we sat down and talked for two hours about
MCDM-1856||what had happened I explained my point of view I explained why the bad guys behave the way they did and the players
MCDM-1857||at the end of the night ultimately thought okay well actually that was pretty epic
MCDM-1858||skoros gave His life so that the druid could escape and as a result everyone had escaped except the wizard if there
MCDM-1859||was any player at the table who was going to sacrifice his character his life so that everyone else could escape
MCDM-1860||it was Phil that's why Phil didn't cast invisibility on himself he cast it on the fighter so the fighter could get out
MCDM-1861||with the shield so they could achieve their new objective of do not let the regen get the shield of and room and he
MCDM-1862||didn't and now they've got some epic bad guys that are on their tail right I mean what a great way to introduce some bad
MCDM-1863||guys maybe there's a way to do it without sacrificing a player though so at the end of the day I don't think the
MCDM-1864||players did anything wrong I don't think they did anything stupid I do feel their choices got more and
MCDM-1865||more narrow as they went and they didn't detect that at first and once they did detect it they weren't sure what they
MCDM-1866||could do and I didn't tell him what they could do because I felt like I don't want to tell you guys what to do then
MCDM-1867||I'm kind of taking some of the fun away from you but since then I have made it a point to remind them of things they know
MCDM-1868||to remind them of their options you know the players interrogate an orc and say is there
MCDM-1869||a secret way into black spire keep in New York says no and I say well he seems to be telling the truth and the players
MCDM-1870||talk about and I have to remind them don't forget you guys know of a secret way in you found out back in the mine
MCDM-1871||from the goblins now normally I wouldn't tell my players that I would expect them to live or die on their own you know on
MCDM-1872||their wit's but again these are new players with one or two exceptions none of them have ever played D&D before so
MCDM-1873||that's the catastrophe episode lesson number one do not take agency away from your players lesson number two
MCDM-1874||communicate to your players and tell them what kind of DM you're going to be what kind of eventually are going to run
MCDM-1875||and don't be afraid to tell them what you think is likely to happen based on this scenario they've concocted don't be
MCDM-1876||afraid of failure because it's going to happen failing doesn't matter what matters is how you respond to that
MCDM-1877||failure be open to your players complaints speak openly about what you thought about your motivation about why
MCDM-1878||things went the way they did my campaign suffered well I thought for a little while might be a fatal catastrophe but
MCDM-1879||my friends and I talked about it and we got over it and we fixed it and we're still playing next time we get the other
MCDM-1880||in play which is tomorrow night the players gonna try and infiltrate broken spire keep which I think is going to be
MCDM-1881||part of the climax of this first book of the campaign they have a lot of ideas about how to lay siege to or infiltrate
MCDM-1882||broken spire keep they thought about sending the druid in disguised as a tiny animal they thought about sending the
MCDM-1883||warlock in using visibility or having the warlock cast invisibility on the Ranger or the thief so they could go in
MCDM-1884||and scout the place and get a map and find out where all the bad guys where are the prisoners but so far they've
MCDM-1885||managed to ambush and kill several different patrols and they've gotten some information about what's going on
MCDM-1886||inside to keep and they've reduced the numbers of the people in the keep a little bit and they even know about a
MCDM-1887||backdoor a secret way in but it's going to require them doubling back and that might take a while and the bad guys
MCDM-1888||might get reinforcements so I'm as excited as anybody if I know what happens next
MCDM-1889||I'm feeling a lot better by the way I'm not iron person I'm like 95% let me know what you guys want to see next as far as
MCDM-1890||episodes go I'm thinking about doing an episode on alignment I'm thinking about doing an episode on setting up cool bad
MCDM-1891||guys I still want to do an episode where we build a campaign together because I think that's the kind of thing that
MCDM-1892||makes running Dungeons & Dragons uniquely fun also of course we're gonna do episodes about prepackaged campaign
MCDM-1893||setting we'll talk about The Forgotten Realms and Grayhawk and about a bunch of other campaign settings that might be a
MCDM-1894||little more obscure but if we do build a campaign together it's probably going to be something where we get together on
MCDM-1895||Twitch and I run hexa prefer and we generate a random map and I look to the chat channel and say okay what are we
MCDM-1896||gonna call this mountain range and who lives here and tell me something interesting about this
MCDM-1897||mountain range that's a secret that the players might not know and after we've done that with all the different regions
MCDM-1898||and features we'll have a campaign map I'm on the Pacific coast so if we get together on Twitch it's probably gonna
MCDM-1899||be on the weekend it's probably gonna be around you know in the afternoon let's say noon ish so far this is like episode
MCDM-1900||16 or 17 and I've promised to do a lot of stuff in these episodes but I've forgotten most of those promises so if
MCDM-1901||you remember when I said oh we'll talk about this in a future episode let me know in the doobly-doo as always there
